Let's take a look. The draft you are looking at is just a thought and a deduction. It is not a mature solution." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the design drawing, and after a while, he gradually moved. The first two are the first-order non-standard construction, and the third one. It is a second-order non-standard construction, and the construction effect is an extremely rare acceleration of the casting. With the addition of this structure, the wizard's casting speed will be increased by 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has fixed his mind, pulled a chair and sat down on the side of the reading table, and began to study each functional unit of the design carefully. For a whole hour, Richard is now a master in the field of construction. The quality of a piece of construction can be seen at the level of the design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin’s design called “Thinking Fast” has enabled a new design approach, with three new features in twenty-three functional units. The functional unit of the design, so designed, is not too far away from Richard. If it is not the curse in Palin's body, the magic can't pass the tenth level, and he will probably reach the level of the big builder in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin is indeed a true genius, a person who can explore the mathematics of the plane in the dark, even if only some fragmented pieces are restored, it is definitely Surprisingly, in the field of magical mathematics, Palin's talent is even more than that of Richard. After getting the opportunity to systematically learn Norland's magical mathematics, Palin's restricted vision is all open, and the inspiration of talent is like a fountain. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, Palin’s achievements are placed in the entire Noland, not too bad, and in time, he must be able to stand. One of the small groups of people at the very top of the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that his magic can’t pass the tenth level...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without enough magical support, the talented characters can't go deep into the world of construction. For example, Richard found several flaws in Palin's second-order structure, but the reason for these flaws is that Palin is from I didn’t have a high level of magic, so I couldn’t understand the many characteristics of the magic. I just got the wrong conclusion from the fantasy. For example, the design of the deep red fire was not corrected by Richard. It will always be a design, not a piece of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sighed and took a look at Palin. Richard still had some little luck and wanted to see if there would be any changes after these years. In fact, Palin may still be in the magic field. Development, but Richard himself knows that this possibility is extremely low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes of Licha shine, the penetrating gaze swept over Palin, and immediately snorted, staring at Palin, double The light in the cymbal was getting stronger and stronger, and even a long flame of more than ten centimeters was ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the vision of Richard, Palin’s heart is hovering with a strong black gas, which is the curse power from the punishment of God, the power of this nature Because it has already penetrated into every corner of Palin's heart, and with every pulsation transmitted to all corners of the body, it is always corroding his vitality, even Richard and quicksand are helpless, perhaps Vatican has a way , but the cost can be too high to be realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, beside the cursed power, Richard unexpectedly saw a lot of the power of time, and was constantly fighting and cursing the power, although the power of time is still insufficient. In order to completely offset the curse power, but has been able to contain the curse power, slowing down the speed of its erosion of Palin's vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pelling, has the empire of the Eternal and Time Dragon recently treated you?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have been studying, just to study the power of time, I have been to the Eternal Dragon Hall in the city twice, but you also know that since the Sands After leaving, the non-clerics have no way to directly touch the power of time in the dragon temple," Palin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Palin suddenly remembered something and said, "Yes, when I first went to the Eternal Dragon Hall to experience the power of time, I used to Bringing the quick-thinking design to the body, when I came into contact with the altar, I suddenly heard a voice, let me put the design on the altar, the feeling of the voice... Well, it’s like what the shrine I can't refuse it, so I did it, and the voice told me that the design was not perfect enough, so that I could perfect it and then sacrifice again. There will be more grace at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice,." Richard was shocked. He never thought that a frame design could actually sacrifice. In the past, when he sacrificed, Richard did. I have seen a lot of construction design drawings, but most of them are fifth-order construction. Palin’s thinking is quick and perfect, but it is only a second-order construction. It is that Richard has personally made a design according to this idea. , can only stop to the third order, and then want to improve, you need a lot of research The room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second-order design can also be sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard felt that he had caught something, but the key points about the sacrifice were still hidden behind the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has fixed his mind and continues to say, "You are so lucky, it should be the will of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, since it requires sacrifice and designation The sacrifice will surely give you grace, what kind of grace you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin recalled and said: "The voice told me at the time, The curse I received will be alleviated, and everything that is related to the grace of life will be doubled in effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, Said: "That is, your luck is good, it seems that it is expected to solve the curse, I was originally prepared to drop the temple of the god of time, Sinai, to weaken his divine power effect. Now it seems that if you can successfully put Sinai If you drop to a weak divine power, you may directly lift the curse on you, but the vitality that has been lost cannot be restored, and you have to find another way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li took a small box of magic box from his arms, opened it and pushed it to Palin, saying: "Looking Drink it at a convenient time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin opens the box and sees a crystal bottle inside, filled with water-like liquid, floating inside With a broken branch, the magic box opened, and there was a scent of fragrance. Palin only smelled it, and immediately felt that the whole body seemed to be a lot easier, and the fatigue was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Life tree is in the golden stage The original twig, eating it can increase the life of three years, but according to your current state of grace, you should be able to increase your life for six years. I can finally relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling now knows how valuable the items that can sustain life, hesitating and saying: "This...this is too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is what you deserve." Then, Richard picked up the manuscripts and raised them. He said, "It is worth more than just these manuscripts."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted for a while and exchanged their thoughts on magical mathematics. Richard also pointed out some problems in the construction of Palin, and the time was up in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the magical mathematics, Palin can already communicate with Richard, and in terms of construction, new ideas and methods are emerging one after another. Maybe Palin can design a third-order structure, although it will only stay in the design stage, but any industry can be less innovative, can only be executed to find the total can still find, by that time, compared to The ability of Qi Qi is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication with Palin also made Richard feel a lot of benefits. When he left, Richard took away three designs, especially It is a quick thinking, which has caused special attention of Richard. If it is an ordinary design, it will not cause the attention of the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Richard spent the study. When it was dawn, Richard’s thoughts suddenly became cheerful and clear, and he understood that the true value of quick thinking is not in three. The newly designed functional unit, but the rearrangement of the functional units, Palin found a new way of using energy, thus able to control the magic of unpredictable, overcoming the recognized problem of casting speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the idea, Richard immediately inspires the spring, and a whole new set of ideas is constantly spurting. He even thinks that it is possible to reproduce the classic magic of sand drifting. : Boiling, of course, the effect of the structure can not reach the level of the exclusive magical sand, but it can almost be compared with Richard's own blood ability: hot shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the design is successful, this will be a fourth-order construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately buried the desk, I don’t know how long it took, and finally outlined the original idea. When he looked up, he was shocked to see the sky outside. The long-lost fatigue burst into my heart, and Richard took a sigh of relief and walked to the window, staring at the morning light outside, but the heart was filled with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of research and exploration, really few people understand, but it is, it has attracted a generation of masters with great talents to invest in it, with lifelong energy To explore the mysteries of the world, without the exploration and contribution of the legendary mage for generations, there will be no Norland today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the day is already bright, Richard is no longer resting, but is going to command the castle. Today is the fourth day. There are countless things to prepare for the battle. It’s not a matter of saying “opening up”, and today Sandy should have arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
