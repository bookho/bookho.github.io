You don’t have a genius descendant, let him bury me.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechaha’s smile said: “From the very beginning, you started to work with me, and you will not repent. How come you are now, you are like a Like the victim, Brahms, is this your glory and dignity? You disappoint me too much. If so, there is nothing to say, oh, yes, forget to tell you, soon I can I got a new batch of god Mu Wujin, which is the strategic reserve of the church cardinal group, so my son will be safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood up Said to Senma: "This is handed over to you." Then he strode away from the parliament hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senmamu sent Richard to leave, and then his eyes fell on the Marquis, smiled charmingly, her smile was glamorous, but the Marquis inexplicably fought a shiver . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma gestured to the knights in the hall and said, "Learn the direct blood relatives of the Marquis and take them to the back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms suddenly changed into a sè, yelling "What do you want to do." The voice did not fall and strove to the Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of Blood is not healed, but it is not the Marquis. She grabs a long sword and attaches the scabbard to the Marquis. Knocking, he knocked him to the ground and then slammed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma grinds hard for a few times, listening to the sound of the marquis rubbing the marble floor, and then eagerly said: "What do I want to do, it is not very clear Of course, it is your family, but you can rest assured that your nephews, scorpions and the like will jump out to inherit your title and territory. Brahms will not perish, but this one is yours. Disappearing from the pedigree, ah, maybe I should leave the Marquise so that she can marry the next young lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Rams wanted to roar, but only issued a syllable, and he was trampled by Senma, and all the curses were trampled back into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the Dragon Wing Castle suddenly ignited the blazing fire. The Marquis House, with its centuries-old history, soon became a ruin in the fire. The Marquis of Brahms and his family were killed in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day after Richard returned to the Black Rose Castle, Senma also came back. The blood paladin only said that the Marquis had been solved, and the other details were not Report, and Richard does not intend to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms is only the fuse of this war, and its status is the same as all the fuses, it will be useless after ignition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dynasty and the bright church are calm, as if nothing has happened, no one knows whether the dispute between St. Martin and the Pope is a continuation, or is it resolved . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the means of the bright church is really powerful, the entire cardinal group, a quarter of the cardinal are all dead, actually did not cause any storm, so Calmly passed, and if Richard is not a party, perhaps he will not know that such a big event happened in the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin’s efficiency is very high. On the third day, several of his samurai samurai came to the Ashan collar and sent five copies of the god Mu Wujin to Li. Look at the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glorious Great Temple and the Black Rose Castle are far apart. These holy samurai are all the way to the Black Rose Castle through the ultra-long-range transmission array. The cost of renting a facility exceeds the value of these gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These holy warriors also brought a large amount of magic material, worth tens of millions of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pleasantly surprised to find that there were a few materials on the Nolanes that had disappeared. It seems that the materials were from the treasure house of the church, and St. Martin sent them. This batch of materials was also not delivered in white, most of which was used to repair four jihad angels, and some could be used to replicate Michael. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, the out-of-print materials still surprise Richard. With them, Richard can realize many of his ideas. In the past, these ideas were lacking. The necessary materials, but only on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa is already very weak, every three days there will be a priest coming over to cast a magical act that activates her vitality, so that her weakness is not so fast But even so, she can only drag for a maximum of one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard got Mu Wujin, he immediately went to the Greenson plane and spent more than two months in the Greenson plane to successfully promote the Magic Armor into a fifth-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s current level of power, he has been able to clearly feel the upper limit of the power of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new magical armed forces are close to the level of the Medalun combat version, but the real use of the gods of the two main gods as the core, in the production process Richard was clearly disturbed by the power of Greenson's plane. Although he eventually succeeded, he failed four times in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This frequency of failure is simply unbearable to Richard, because every failure means that nearly 4 million worth of magic material is gone, Richard Originally expected to be successful up to three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in other architects, if you fail to complete the magical armed forces only four times, it is a miracle that can boast a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of failures are not without benefits, and the process of crushing the magic to the extreme again and again stimulates the rapid growth of Richard's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the legend, the bottleneck that limits the strong is mainly controlled by the law, but Richard is just the opposite. He also started to touch the rules at the level of the big magister. And when you step into the sanctuary of heaven, you control more than one rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now, Richard has taken control of several rules, such as the relatively shallow rules of the Greenson Life Rules, he has resolved all the upper rules There are only 16 underlying rules left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once these underlying rules are broken, Richard is completely equivalent to Greenson’s world tree in terms of rule power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of improving the magical armed forces, Nyris always stayed by Richard, she did not say no, she looked at Richard so quietly. It will not bother him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After immersing himself in the world of architecture, Richard will become extremely engaged and focused, sometimes working continuously for days and nights, whenever this time, Nyris can also sit for a few days and nights. When Richard finally returned from the world of construction and magic, even if there was the strength of the sanctuary, Nyris could barely stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neri's waiting, as well as some of the look of hope in Ning Ding, made Richard very tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the bright eyes, Richard always had the urge to escape, but his willpower was strong and he endured. Down, did not show any difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the time passed, Nyris kept watching, and there was a tremor in Richard’s heart. He really didn’t know how to face this charm. Amazing four emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes escaping is also a good solution, and the construction is the way that Richard escapes, but when the difficult configuration is successful, the magic The armed forces were finally made, and Richard finally looked up and looked at Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, very soon."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to go with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked aside and said, "No, this There will be some dangers, I am afraid I can't take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris nodded and said, "Okay." After that, he never mentioned it again. Check out the adventure together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green's sky is always yīn, there is no sunshine, whenever you look up, through the sky-covered crown, you see a piece Gray sè, the weather here is as good as the cháo wet yīn cold, staying in this ghost place for a long time is simply going to make people crazy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Iwaki has become a fuel at your fingertips. Almost every household's fireplace is always burning with a warm flame, which makes people feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush to set off, but first went to see the Golden World Tree and the Brood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden World Tree is now over 50 meters high, and the wide canopy covers a range of hundreds of meters, compared to the real world tree. It is still a small sapling, but as a god of higher spirits, the Golden World Tree has shown its distinctiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the canopy, the light of the golden sè will be shè, these lights are warm and bright, dispelling the cháo wet and yīn cold in the forest, let the tree become a world full of beautiful glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came to the golden world tree, he was shocked by this miraculous scene, and the glory of the golden world tree could replace the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving Yongji jīng spirits built a small village under the golden world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They built the temple of Luna Ai Lucia and tried to build the moon well, but the monthly force in the green forest is very weak, this moon well needs to be spent Noland's time is several times before it can accumulate a well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard arrived, the water in the moon well was just full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood at the side of the moon, the blood of the silver moon in the body could not keep shaking, and the breath of the moon made him feel fascinated. He leaned over and picked up a spring, looked at it carefully, and then took a cautious drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuejing spring water is full of moon power and life, and the moon in the sky is obviously dominant, this spring is the holy thing of jīng spirit, drink In the next few minutes, you can fill up the magic power of a legendary mage in a few minutes. At the same time, it has the healing effect equivalent to that of the great priest. In the end, it can also slightly increase the magical limit of the wizard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the jīng spirit empire died in the past, there were several wars in order to inherit the months of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, this moon well is still very young and the effect is weak, but this is his first such deep contact with the moon well. The days that belong to the jīng spirit also slowly wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden World Tree is now swaying in the sand, and the light from the canopy is gradually darkening, which means that the dusk has arrived, and after a while, the world The radiance of the tree crown will disappear completely, and the night will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the golden world tree, Richard can feel that his will is cheering and flying around him like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
