The Dark Blue Master is poor. This is only the basic quality. It is necessary to know that the quicksand also possesses a strange and powerful melee fighting technique. Everything can be her weapon and all terrain can be utilized. Richard confirmed this with his personal experience. Even if he had studied the fighting skills of the dark world, he only had the power to fight. Coupled with the addition of various magical techniques, it can be said that the melee combat power of the quicksand is very impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like relying on the “extinction” knife, the double magic bonus, Richard using the blood burst and the elf secret sword can chase the killer of the same level Like a mad hack, if a guy thinks he can do whatever he wants when he is close to himself, he will also find himself a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand's close combat skills can attack any angle, and her body can make all kinds of incredible movements. This ability is used in the bed, the power and the battlefield are equally powerful, and even more than that. As long as she is willing, she can let any man climb to heaven in an instant, then fall into the abyss, and then sink forever in the whirlpool of the Chaos Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On last night, the sand was only played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only last night that Richard discovered that he had a double-digit battle for one night. However, the last two or three times were crushed and crushed by the sand. This is contrary to an old saying, that is, magic, such as water in a sponge, as long as it is willing to squeeze, there is always. However, on that occasion, the need to change the magic into the essence is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night also let Richard know another thing, that is, if the sand is not willing, he really can't force / rape her. Even if Richard is really put into action, most of the time will be scrapped by the quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked out the bed, and the water that was placed in the wash basin was very cold, and wiped the face at random, then pushed open the window and took it with me. Some cool winds came to the surface and couldn't be said to be comfortable. The sand was really in the yard. When he pushed the window, she was walking back to her room and saw only a still vibrant back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes fell on the three trucks in the yard, satisfying the heart. These trucks represent the hope of going home. He wants to go back, look at the teacher, and become even stronger. Go to Calando to see the mountain and the sea with the little scorpion, and then tell her, don't do anything stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are two little doubts in the heart of Richard. The first is that with his experience of only two sacrifices, this dragon owl seems to be not enough for a high-level sacrifice, and at most it is an intermediate ritual. An intermediate ceremony, without the bonus of the Eternal Dragon Hall, can you really get the coordinates of Noland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another doubt, it is that Liusha once asked to see the pictures of the future that made him gloomy. Li originally thought that he needed to carefully describe the contents of the pictures in the sand, and even he was ready to draw the pictures by hand. However, after he agreed, the sand will never mention this. In this case, he did not take the initiative to talk about it. Richard intuitively, those contents still don't tell the sands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is not at breakfast, she kept shutting herself in the room, not knowing what was being studied. This is a very common thing, so Richard did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. After breakfast, he dressed neatly and went to see Luofu and Falcao, ready to talk about the two-package business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough to return to Norland Light. It takes a lot of magic to build a stable plane, which means that it consumes a lot of magic crystal. Referring to the portal built by Faro's Master Lenna, Richard estimates that at least three hundred magic crystals are needed to build a portal that can be used twice. This does not include the consumption of the nest and its creations. Richard did not see similar records in Noland, and the mother's own knowledge system does not seem to be, whether it is calculated according to the creature, or calculated according to the weapon. However, the difference is a thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred magic crystals, plus many magic materials for building portals, even at the price of blood-stained land, this is a huge amount of more than 300,000 gold coins . If you are in Noland or the Faro Humanity, you will be afraid of 800,000 to 1.2 million gold coins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard is in need of money. He now feels that the plane war is not a good deal. It requires huge upfront investment, unforeseen risks, and will face a dilemma in the new plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only good news is that once this plane is built, it will bring the two planes closer in a sense. The next plane of the plane is built on this basis, the corresponding consumption will be much smaller, and the number of people and materials that can be passed will increase significantly. After hundreds of years of investment, the plane channel can even pass hundreds of thousands of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard left, the sand was buried in countless paper. These papers are covered with various numbers and formulas, as well as various mysterious gods. She always bites her pen in her mouth, grabs a short amber hair, and buryes her head and fights with piles of numbers. If Richard sees this scene, he will be shocked. Because the flow of sand in the geometry of the plane is already very deep, she is calculating the construction of the space-time channel and the double-sided coordinates. Richard’s level in this respect is not as good as her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how much, the sand suddenly smashed all the paper in front of me, slammed it on the wall, and then cried and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning effort, did not get any results, at least not the results she wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without complete grace, she cannot rely on her own strength to calculate the return to the Noland Channel. She had hoped to use some of the gods as the basis to calculate the coordinates to Noland, only need to be Noland, no precise positioning. But the work of the morning showed that this was a completely impossible task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first calculation, but it will get the same result every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is sitting in a dull manner, tears always flow involuntarily, slipping over the cheeks, flowing over the neck, and then wetting the robe. I don't know how long it took, she suddenly rubbed her eyes, wiped her tears, took photos in front of the mirror, and made herself holy and unparalleled, and it came out of the room. Just a little red eyes, but quietly betrayed her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once again stepped into the yard where the dragon was placed, as Richard asked, the current courtyard only lived in Richard and Liusha, and no one else The Lord’s knights were only patrolling outside the wall, without permission. Before Richard opened the window and opened the door behind, the sound of leaving the courtyard was clearly heard, but she did not want to look up from the world of computing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth of the sand and the depths of the sand again emerged as a time hourglass, the pale-colored eyes fell on the dragon's owl, and the book of time in the hand is constantly pouring out of pale gold. God light, mixed with the sight of the sand. Under the gaze of sand, these dragons seem to be transparent, and countless information gathers into small gods, and then return to the doubles of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
