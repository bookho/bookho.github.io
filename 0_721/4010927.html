Even if you are pregnant, it doesn’t matter. Now the blood of Archimonde is very delicious! Don’t worry about the body, we have a dragon whip!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha Khan is in the rain, busy saying: "Not like this"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing suddenly thinks of something Suddenly said: "I almost forgot, you still have the ability of the bear's first superintendent! But the bear's first superintendent is nothing, the thing is too low-level, and it is not a grade, it is comparable to the dragon whip to be mighty and domineering! You Now, every day, with a bunch of legendary mixes, do you mean that you are eating the first bear superintendent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not eating..." Richard weakly wanted to argue for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing waved his hand, simply ignored him, and said without hesitation: "And the ability of the dragon is much stronger than the bear’s first warlord. You haven't seen much of the dragon's blood on the mainland? Half Dragon, Lizard, Dragon Vessel, Dragon Blood Gnome, these don't say, even the Kobolds have some dragon blood! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing no face, the more the sky is wide, Richard hurriedly interrupted her and asked: "My and Micks, you are How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am your guardian of your choice, you can see it, think of it, of course I can see it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, impossible! This relationship should be the reverse, how could it be like this?" Richard was deeply shocked and even more incredible. Because he simply can't know the faceless thoughts, he can't share his vision with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Richard thought that as long as he didn't want to, he couldn't feel his thoughts without face, just like other followers. But now he finds that he is completely closed without facing him, but his soul is completely open to no face, and it is almost unobstructed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is who who is calling the guardian of the day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Richard's questioning, no face is just staring at him with an idiot's eyes, and proudly said: "Who am I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is who ? When Richard thought of summoning her to come out, the voice was full of domineering, drinking other raging roars, and his mouth was open, but nothing could be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have some contradictions with the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple over there, and I don't necessarily get the gods I want..." Sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, this sentence has a faceless ridicule: "Contradictions? What are the contradictions between you and them? What do you think the title of the space lord is for?" With this title, I am still like you. If I were you, I would have been killed on the altar of the old dragon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have space lords The title, the first thing to go to the Dragon Hall every time is to call out all the big priests, first make a good time, then pick a big buttocks to accompany me to sacrifice, of course, accompanying the bed is a must. Want God You have to pay first, this is a hidden rule.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding rules, you don’t understand, don’t understand? Well, I repeat it in the language, now you understand Yes, that's it. Those who refuse to be unspoken, of course, use the authority of your space lord to throw directly outside the Dragon Hall. Without God's grace, they are just ordinary women.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These women really think that the great priest is a great and indispensable profession? It is decoration, the old dragon is just to take these big gods to look at its high-end atmosphere. So any girl with a chest and a buttocks, may be a big priest, and can be a good. Seriously, the eternal dragon temple What really works is the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been completely stunned, sweating his forehead, and never thought of interrupting her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, there was no effort to take a shot on Richard’s shoulder and said, “In an industry like this who can do anything and benefit a lot, of course, there is no way to dive. The rules are! So don't worry about it, this opportunity is not a waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great effort, no face is ready to shoot Richard Going up, but Richard's current strength is not the same, the body just shook, actually resisted her shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face snorted, a war prisoner threw himself on Richard, and instantly pulled him from the legendary altar to the mortal world. Then he pressed his hand on Li's shoulder and shook his foot. It instantly destroyed Richard's center of gravity, then slapped it and finally took Richard to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crackdown succeeded in making the faceless feelings great, immediately receiving the effect of the war prisoners, said to Richard: "As long as there are sacrifices, you do not have to worry about equipment. Question. You will definitely get a lot of things you want when you sacrifice, or else what is the title of the space lord? How can your treatment be like the waste? The equipment is only!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next explanation is fast, most of the construction is what Qi Qi can do now, and the fourth-order or higher still needs Richard's hands. However, at the speed of the construction of Richard, a fourth-order construction may not take two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is heavily tied to the fourth and fifth steps, and then says: "These two places are the work you need to do." After he has done it, our exchange will prosper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, this is truly a unique part, and the entire exchange list. The core is. He studied the points needed for the exchanges and suddenly frowned. He said: "We can make a lot of money by the ratio of this point exchange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"30% profit, you can rest assured, I control very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So high profits? Are they willing to redeem?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you want it? The previous period is all about paying. Everyone knows this. Their real goal is some really useful things on the list. Some can only be found here, such as the fifth-order structure and the rare four-order structure. For these, let us earn some money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard nodded, so that the profit generated by the exchange can make this list very profitable. If it is not necessary to create a convertible structure in order to maintain the attractiveness of the exchange, Richard can do nothing at all, sit and watch the exchange system to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the fourth or fifth order, the exchange value is not cheaper than the market price. The key is still said in the faceless, the real high-end powerful structure is priceless and no market, that is, there is money to buy. The main reason why most of the strong people accumulate less is not a small harvest, but a special demand, which may exhaust all their previous savings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The exchange price of these sacrifices is a bit high.” Richard pointed to one of the top sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face to face, said: "These top sacrifices are not for fair trade, but for the consumption of excess points. There will always be some People exchanged the things they needed, but for a long time they couldn’t afford to lose a lot of points. Then they can exchange the sacrifices. Although they will lose money, they will not lose much, and the price of the top sacrifices will fluctuate drastically. But what about the absence of top-level offerings does not happen from time to time? And we can control the amount of redemption, and each time we put a top-level offering for redemption. Of course, the more you exchange, the better. Anyway, you have a space lord. The title, if you can't get the second level of grace in the old dragon, there is no special difference between you and other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li continues to study the list: "here There is also a grading system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also one of the core systems. The more total points we get from us, the more they rank. The higher the score. For example, 100 points is the first level, 200 points is the second level, 500 It is a three-level, and so on. Each level can be opened for a portion of the redemption items, and the price will also be discounted. For example, the fourth-order configuration requires 100 to 300 points, but the 100 points must be three levels. In order to redeem, 300 points will require four levels to redeem. This is roughly the case..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered for a moment: "This way The first to participate in the exchange program will have an advantage, but in the eyes of the later strong, this advantage is not irreparable, so that everyone will have motivation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Smart!" No face to praise. But Richard thinks that she is looking at her own eyes, or is it like watching an idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, then, finally, our point trading system. But in principle we do not encourage point trading, so we will charge heavy taxes on the deduction of the transaction, such as I said that at present I will set the tax rate at 30%, that is, trading 100 points, only 70% to the hands of the need. And the traded points can only be split into the level points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will come to trade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always someone who needs it. For example, when When two people want to exchange something, such as the fifth-order structure, there will be a large demand for points. At this time, more than 100 points are good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
