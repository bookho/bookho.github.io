			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when his little hand touched the seventh statue, the idol suddenly became A shadow, all drilled into Richard's body. For a moment, Richard only felt that his head was in a fire, his brain was boiling, and the pain that directly affected the soul almost made him crazy, but he could not faint. And a stream of ice is swimming all over his body, colliding with the invisible heat wrapped around the body, so that Richard feels that every inch of flesh is cracking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked hard and patient, and the tenacity and strength that emerged from childhood exercise appeared at this moment, and actually insisted that all the shadows entered the body. When the last shadow was absorbed, the spirit of Richard was finally loose, and the temple was blurred. The goddess' temple was gradually faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a vague vision, Richard saw his mother’s beautiful and concerned face, and he finally relaxed and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I got two abilities, my mother will be proud of me!" In the fluttering darkness, Richard thought subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attic, there was an obvious crack on the altar of the goddess of the moon, and this rare altar was damaged in the ceremony. Elaine was pale and had a blood on her lips. She was unaware of it. She only looked at Richard's body insanely. When he saw his body intact, he did not suffer any damage. Mind. But when she found a small shadow in the heart of Richard's eyebrows, her face changed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a light and moonlight in the attic, and Richard is lying on his back, no matter which light source will not leave a shadow on Richard's eyebrows. That small piece of shadow is like a mist, slowly swimming, but it is not condensed. This is a shadow that ordinary people can't tell at all, but Elaine, who still has the power of the fifth string, can see it. She trembled, reaching for touch, and the faint cold and stinging sensation of the fingertips was the feeling of the shadow energy and the conflict of the power of Ailsia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow Creature?!" Elaine screamed. She bit her teeth and once again plunged her fingers into the shadow of Richard's eyebrows, meditation in the prayers that had long since become strange. That was the foresight that Elaine had not mastered in the past, but her heart was already chaotic at this moment. In her knowledge, only this magic can unlock the origin of the shadow of Richard. Even if she wants to be jealous again, she must try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since losing her identity as a great sacrifice, she has lost the care of the goddess and all the magic. Originally it was a random move under desperation, but Elaine did not expect that the magical foresight was unexpectedly successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Elaine, there is a scroll, which is endless nothingness and darkness, only the energy of chaos, no moon at all, no stars. In the chaos, a huge shadow is slowly moving, and the seemingly chaotic running track finally gathers on a track, pointing to the final clear destination, that is, Little Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture flashed away, and the short-term foresight has exhausted all of her power, leaving her with no effort to move her fingers. Even if she is full of energy, everything she sees makes her feel deeply desperate again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow is not the same as darkness, it is an energy that does not exist in essence, and naturally has spatial attributes. There are countless types of shadow creatures, most of which wander between planes, aimless. The chaotic energy between the faces is their natural nourishment. They are embarrassing, dangerous and powerful, so they are also the species that the wizards love and fear. Shadow summoning is already a very mature spell, from six to seven. But this spell has a small chance of failure, and the Shadow creatures summoned at that time will lose control, and the magician Master is one of the most delicious foods in their eyes. Therefore, every year on the mainland, there are several accidents in which the shadow creatures summoned by the mage are swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark shadow of Xiao Li’s eyebrows has signs of life, but it is not a complete life. The shadow energy contained in it is not powerful, and it can be purified by an ordinary sacrifice. Its function is actually similar to the lighthouse. It calibrates a position in the infinitely complex plane universe, summoning a large group of shadow life into this plane, which is exactly what Elaine saw in the foresight. Now, even if it is too late to erase this dark shadow, the horrible shadow life has been crowned and has already begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Little Richard is the coordinates and anchors they enter into this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When large groups of shadow creatures begin to impact the plane, Little Richard has only two possible endings, either destroyed by intense energy conflicts or The most powerful shadow creature possesses, forever losing control of the body. At that time, he will become a container for the Shadow Creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can tell the rules of the plane. The crossed creatures may take hundreds of years to complete the journey, or they may arrive at the end one month later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could this be..." Elaine held Richard and muttered, tears could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly looked up, through the skylight, looking to the fifth string moon still hanging high in the sky, just to see a trace on the moon, such as Dry blood. It turned out that the force of the string moon has mutated, which led to changes in the enlightenment ceremony. But if she is still the great sacrifice of A Lucia, there will be no variation in enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the punishment of Ailcia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan thought bitterly, she had no strength to complain about her fate, or to blame herself. She took Richard down the stairs, then placed him carefully on the bed and covered the quilt. In his sleep, Richard frowned slightly, but smiled from time to time, apparently dreaming of many happy things. He is a very beautiful boy, his little face has just begun to fade away from childishness, and there are already some handsome and handsome. Elaine quietly stares at her child, which is the whole focus of her ten-year life. Although for a long life, the decade is only a short time, but now it is as long as a lifetime. Xiao Li is very fast, only slightly more tender than a human boy of the same age. This is only because of the blood, Richard, who has half of the silver moon elves, also has nearly five hundred years of natural life. And his appearance also combines the two characteristics of rough and hard and the delicate beauty of the Silver Moon Elf. Only Elaine knows why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s little face, the little shadow of the group is still hovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan gently sighed and kissed Richard’s forehead and left the room. She sat alone in the living room, staring at the night sky, the past flowing through the bottom of my heart. Those nights, almost condensed the fierce, hateful and loving love of her entire life! Now, she has to think back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, the fifth month of blood-staining is quietly removed, and the sixth string of moons that shine with a unique golden light has risen. When the seventh string of moons emerges from the horizon, the day will be bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the seventh string of moons finally spilled into the window and shined on Elaine’s face. She has a lot of beauty and a lot of beauty, and the mirror on the wall reflects a very beautiful figure. This is what she was like. She has almost forgotten this face for ten years. This is the grace that the Silver Moon Wizard can have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and carefully took out a magical paper starred with stars and spread it out on the table. Then take out the sealed magic pen and check it. Fortunately, the ink mana saved in the magic pen made of the lion's tail feather is still there. This is the ink made from the blood of the unicorn. Although there are only a few drops, the letter she has to write is not long enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
