			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, this beast with unknown origins, countless strong people are unwilling The source of the nightmare, but left his own nest, squatting in the center of the military fortress, the huge body of dozens of meters crushed many buildings in the fortress, its huge body has numerous criss-cross wounds The dozens of hoses under the head of the vertebrae used to suck the brains were cut, and a strong man of Noland was standing next to the torso of Maranus, looking around with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This savage beast that has not lived for a long time has become a corpse at this moment. There are traces of fierce battles everywhere in the fortress, countless Dakosudas The bodies were still in the dead place, no one had time to clean up their bodies, and even the bodies of the Nolan Strongs did not converge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building in the fortress has been damaged by more than half, and there is a horrible big hole at the edge. The violent shock wave even destroyed all the square kilometers. In the building, there are all kinds of strange smells in the air. The middlemen want to vomit, but in the city of the fortress, several strong people of Noland are quietly packing up their wounds, or closing their eyes, they have Tired of death, and even no strength to celebrate this historic victory, two of these strong people are particularly eye-catching, wearing the same dark armor, and other strong personalized strong costumes to form a distinct In contrast, the chest of their armor has traces of large pieces of frustration, and the badges that should have been there have been artificially destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you look closely, you can see that the armor on them is the style of the Holy League royal family. These two people sit alone and with other strong people. Not gregarious, not talking, just taking care of themselves, but no one is no dissatisfied with the Nolan strong, in the crazy counterattack of Dakso Das, the strong are very clear about these two quite How powerful the mysterious characters are, as can be seen from the countless Dakosudas who have been shredded by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where you are, the heavenly sanctuary can get the same respect as the legendary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I can see that there is a dense black spot moving far away, which is the defeat of the counterattack Rising Sun. The Dakso Das who were forced to retreat, and under the wall in front of the strong, there were many bodies of the strong Dakso Das, and there was a strangely large man, the Warlord, even on the city. Behind the strong, there are still a few dragons' bodies. In the battle, the strongmen of Noland were completely surrounded by Dakosodas and stormed from all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the rising sun has returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, on the ground, a figure is coming from the far direction to the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fat man, wearing only a pair of leather pants all over the body, revealing the shiny belly completely, a pair of big feet full of black hair On the earth, step by step to the fortress, the pace is solid and powerful, his footsteps are heavy, the ground will splash a little dust or even stones, but any body type such as his fat, even the most ordinary people, there will be Such a heavy pace, with his power, can make the earth tremble when he sets foot as other strong people, but he does not, just look at his footsteps, it is no different from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even without a large earthquake as a foil, there is no legendary armor as a side proof, the only one that is three meters long on the shoulder. The one-meter-thick square-edge chopper is still full of rust, and there are even two fist-sized gaps on the blade. This man who is as strong as a hill is oily but has the spirit of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man does not need any momentum, he stands there, is the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the surprisingly large broken square knife in his right hand, and placed the giant knife on his shoulder, carrying three heads on his left hand, the three heads They belonged to different races, and the hair, beard and fleshy tentacles were entangled together, and they were tied in a random way. So they were put in the hands of the man and headed for the rising sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Dakosodas retreated, the man pursued alone and brought three heads back, but everyone familiar with him knew that his killings There must be more than three in number, because only the enemy that he can see is the one who is honored to let him put his head back, can be stared at him, and look at the entire Dax Sodas, it will be famous. The strongest surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He approached the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black armies who are resting are jumping from the top of the city and falling in front of the huge fat man with bare chest and back, kneeling down on one knee. Respectfully: "Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Norland's strongmen have also jumped from the city, kneeling on both sides of the avenue, and respectfully said: "Your Majesty ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong are all dignified, especially the strong ones of the extremist battlefield. However, all the strong, including the heavenly sanctuary, are willing to lower their proud head and bend their unyielding body. , stumbled in front of this man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he washed away the shame of the Holy League for decades, he almost broke into the rising place of the rising sun with his own strength, and smashed the famous The changed brain-eating Maranos, in the next few days, blocked the crazy counterattack of the Dakso Das, the rusted square giant blade that looks like a magnifying kitchen knife, but a knife But the hundreds of Dax Sodas strongmen were killed, and the rust on them was not even scraped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the real strongman saw this giant-shaped kitchen knife with a very funny style, but he was afraid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife is a legend in itself. Any existence that dares to despise it has been lost under its blade. When Charles the Great waved it, it was under the magic dragon. When Lamo's head was heard, the strongest sound was played for its legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap on the blade is smashed on the neck bone of Dala Moa, and the rust on the knife is traced by the blood of the dragon's neck. The original name of this knife is called the Dragon Slayer. Perhaps so far, it is also the most deserved one among the numerous Noland's weapons with the name of the Dragon Slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the Dragon Slayer is in the hands of the sturdy fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is the emperor of the Holy Alliance, bloodthirsty Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boil them, and celebrate the wine tonight." Philip said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plop, the three heads were thrown into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard opened his eyes, he saw the ceiling covered with mottled and filthy stains. The ceiling was high and far, and the height was close to ten meters. Normal Norland's human architecture can't have such a high lift. Obviously this is either an alien room or a special purpose hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the traces on the ceiling made Richard feel very familiar, and seemed to have seen it, just as he drives his own consciousness and tries to think back, Suddenly a sound like a broken voice was heard: "Bad boy, don't be dazed when you wake up, hurry up with me, I am tired of being exhausted by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The voice is equally familiar, but Richard can't remember where he heard it, and his body is very strange at the moment, clearly able to feel the existence of various parts of the body, but the body does not obey his command. Richard felt that his chest and abdomen were particularly cool, as if the wind was blowing, but how could the wind blow into the body, and then there was a strange touch that seemed to have a pair of hands touching. Richard's internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly woke up and widened his eyes. He looked up hard and looked at his body, but he saw that he was lying down and his chest was Cut open, a pair of skinny hands are holding organs like the liver, cutting with a knife with a rust, suddenly seeing such a horrible scene, Richard is surprisingly not shocked Terror, but the moment to perceive the state of the body, found that the parts below the neck are not under their control, they turned their heads and looked at their environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the line of sight, Richard saw an old face, only looking at the wretched expression, knowing that it was St. Lawrence, seeing him Richard paused with a sigh of relief. The former sacred sergeant may have a higher level of medical skill than he once had. It is only in his hands, what kind of injury will not be a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard is calm, St. Lawrence is obviously very disappointed. He said: "Stupid boy, it is quite calm, I still hope to scare you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahe smiled and said, "I just woke up, the reaction was slow, and I started to be scared now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lawrence heard this and immediately looked at Richard with a suspicious look and asked: "The kid, how big you are, just talk, this is really true." I am quite comfortable in my heart, but it is not like what you should say at this age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I say at this age?" Richard asked freely . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence’s movements kept on his hands and said, “You young people, do not like to express that they are not afraid of fear, that is, the abyss hell can also dare to take a nap? If you drink some wine, you will feel that you can even cut the legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a smile and said: "You saved my life. It saved the white night, and the white night helped me a lot. If you count it, your help to me is difficult to measure. I will make you happy and what counts."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
