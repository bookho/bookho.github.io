			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large steel entanglement on the top of the dome, which has a foot of more than ten meters. The large giant faucet hangs under the dome. The faucet is dark black, covered with spurs and sharp corners, and even if it has been dead for a long time, it will not damage its horror. Unlike ordinary dragons, it has more than a dozen eyes, large and small, and hundreds of fangs protrude from the irregular mouth. As soon as he saw it, Richard knew that this was not a dragon in the ordinary sense, but a dragon that only moved deep in the depths of the abyss. In terms of body shape and strength, perhaps only the legendary dragon species such as the ancient dragon. Can be compared to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abyssal Dragon Dala Moya is the most victorious victory in the life of Charles the Great who created the Holy Alliance. It is also the highest in the abyss. Record. During his heyday, Charles the Great gathered dozens of planes with millions of planes and attacked the abyss. At that time, it took more than a month to send the main force into the abyss, and for this unprecedented army. The service is more than 30 million people. In the extremely harsh living environment of the abyss, countless human powers have built a path to the core of the abyss with their own flesh and blood, while Charles led the seven generals who opened the country into the abyss core, killing the devil in one fell swoop. Ronda Dharma, and brought the dragon's faucet back to Noland, hanging under the gate of the floating city, as proof of the martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Abyss, only a year later, Charles the Great died. The leader of Dala Moya has been handed down from generation to generation. As long as human beings still occupy the city of miracles, it will be the spiritual pillar of human beings, encouraging generations of generations to step into the unpredictable depths of the plane and create belongings. My own legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the huge arch, it is a sloping avenue, the end of the road, the most prosperous and luxurious things, the fascinating, according to the mountain I opened my whole picture in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the green trees, between the peaks and peaks, there are scattered buildings with pale gold as the main tone. The light in the entire space is very soft, whether it is the roof, the outer wall, the street, or the gorgeous carvings that can be seen everywhere, it seems to be spotless, like a fairyland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue sky, floating islands of different sizes are slowly moving along the predetermined trajectory. This corner of the sky is extraordinarily pure and clear, giving people a strange feeling of time and space. In the center, a seven-color arc-shaped light belt passes by, and the light belt is adorned with seven rounds of slowly rotating moon. If it is not known that it is daylight, Richard really has to mistakenly recognize that the seven-string moon of Noland's mainland is hung on the light belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard, who received the Luna’s enlightenment, is extremely sensitive to the power of Qixianyue. When looking at the seven rounds of the self-rotating moon on the light belt, Richard actually felt the faint moon power. Although it seems that it will disappear at any time, it is absolutely true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard’s face changed and changed, Modred’s voice rang again, successfully pulling Richard back from the real and the illusion: "How, is it spectacular? When I first came here with your father, I was completely stupid. I didn’t see it with my own eyes. I couldn’t imagine that there would be such a place in the world! But you are practicing magic. So, the rainbow in July can't be seen more. In the past, there was a magician who just arrived at Faust, and he didn't know the jealousy. He stared at the rainbow in July for too long. As a result, the whole body magic burned and died. Every year like this. There are quite a few examples!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was immediately shocked, and he did sense the unique power of the seven-string moon each month, and motivated The magic inside the body formed a small magic tide. However, if it continues, it seems that the magic burning situation that Modred said is not going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modred again grinned and said loudly: "Little Richard, come with me! I will show you some good things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is The main road of the floating gate, there are many people coming and going. Modred did not trim the margins, and the sound was loud, and immediately attracted pedestrians to look at them. However, most people have unpleasant faces on their faces and glare at Modred, but no one really stands up. It was not until Modred’s lava was moved away that people talked about it, and the words were full of disdain and contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus is a glorious city of miracles, like the Knights of Mordred, who are full of blood and face, and indeed look like this city. It doesn't fit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred completely heard what people were saying, and even Richard could hear it. However, Modred just smiled and didn't take these arguments to heart. Instead, he took Richard through the gates of FS and went straight to a gorgeous and delicate small square on the east side of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing under the vault of the gate, Richard suddenly trembled, raised his head in dismay, and glanced at the dragon's dragon head. Just after the moment just below the faucet, he suddenly had a feeling that it seemed that one of the eyes of the dragon had quietly turned. But nothing happened, and the head of the Abyssal Dragon was still there as it was hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred went all the way to the edge of the small square before jumping off the lava and handing it over to a teenager standing next to the square. Although the lava is violent, but the wisdom is extremely high, there is no dissatisfaction with the arrangement of the master, but quietly followed the teenager to the shed set up for the mount. It was only when it entered the horse shed, the various types of mounts that were originally staying inside jumped into the dog, and desperately squeezed into the corner. There was even a huge violent bear in the shape of a huge steel armor, which was also very disproportionate to its huge size. Agile, jumped aside and gave up a wide open space in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lava walked quietly into the vacant place, quietly standing in the middle of the stable, occasionally squirting a sigh of gas, it would The stunned riders were scared and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at the lava and had a hint of envy. He is a builder and naturally knows that he wants to create his own knight. The ride is a crucial part of it. And Maudred’s combat power, I am afraid that a small part of it is contributed by lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This! Richard!" Modred urged. So Richard also got off the horse and walked to the side of Modred, looking in the direction he pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the magical model of Faustian. It is so subtle that it goes deep into every detail, and even the floating islands and the July rainbow are very fine. The floating model floats above a huge magical crystal, while the floating island model rotates around the same trajectory as the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard can see clearly that the position of the floating islands is not completely irregular, but can be divided into seven layers according to the flight path. . The first floor is a floating island, which is also the largest; the second two floating islands are slightly smaller than the floating islands on the first floor. The third layer of three floating islands, and so on, to the seventh layer of orbit, the flight path is slightly lower than the foundation of the floating world. In the same layer, the closer to the floating island of Faustian, the more beautiful and luxurious the building and scenery on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He observed very carefully, and immediately saw the magical engraving of surnames and family crests on many floating islands. On the third floating island on the seventh floor, the familiar Archimonde family badge jumped into the eye. After several centuries, the Archimonde family has already had the badges of dozens of branch families, and this number is still increasing due to the inferiority of the family. All Archimonde badges have two elements, the flame and the devil. However, there is only one such as Gordon, who uses the volcano and the devil's lord as badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard, the floating island is your father's territory. It is in the third place on the seventh track. You must also see that the higher the orbit, the larger the floating island. The more position in the same track Close to the floating world, the floating island is also the same. The family that can stand on the floating world is ranked, and the floating island represents the ranking order. Now there are at least four families in the floating world, behind us."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the meaning of the ranking?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of the ranking is very large. First of all, it determines the number and time each family can enter the Eternal Dragon Hall every year. In addition, the family that can be stationed in the floating world. The number is fixed. Whenever a new family successfully enters the floating world, the last family will be automatically cleared of the fauna. Their position will be replaced by the new family. So whenever there is a new family wants When entering the volcano, the last family will fight for death, because this is a battle of life and death that directly affects their status, and other families will help."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately thought of a question: "After even if it is successfully stationed in Faust, isn’t it necessary to immediately face other family challenges that also want to enter FS, no matter which family, when they first entered Faust, Not all of them are badly hurt? What do you use to fend off the next offense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred nodded and nodded and said, "Yes. So, said to successfully enter the floating world The decade is the most difficult time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and pointed to the floating island belonging to Archimonde, saying: "But we It’s not the last one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because we fought two families when we entered the volcano! Your father is impatient and those guys are more Entangled, the family on the floating island of No. 3 was also cleared out of the fauna, and it was taken down. So we can be quiet for a while. As for the family, they should be unlucky, and they must have the family elite and the main force. Putting on the road of our expedition, hehe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred’s words made Richard’s heart rise and I don’t know what it is. But the first time I came to Faust, he still has a lot of things to be familiar with, to understand. At this moment, Modred suddenly smiled and asked: "Little Richard, you guess, our respectable emperor, Where does the bloodthirsty Philippe live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked away and immediately fell to the imposing and magnificent palace on the highest mountain in the city of Faust The group, then pointed to the question: "Here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the Temple of Eternal Dragon." Modred shook his head and pointed to the fifth floor. The penultimate floating island on the track, said: "This is where the palace of our great emperor is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Richard ate Surprised, said: "This is the fifth floor! Is there a more powerful family in the floating world than the emperor's Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not! In some cases, our great majesty is not an emperor. In fact, all floating islands above the fifth floor are closed. The first three floating islands on the fifth floor are also closed,” said Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no one to occupy them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floating islands are sealed The unsealing requires the gift of the Eternal Dragon. Only if there is enough dedication to the Eternal Dragon Temple, it is possible to lift more of the floating island seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
