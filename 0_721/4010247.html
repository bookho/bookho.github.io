			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, a faint glow was swept, and Lina’s body. The robes on Lina's body are just the most common items, which can't stop Richard's perspective. So Richard saw a large waterfall-like scar on her chest, although the traces are not too heavy, but compared with the delicate skin around. Still a bit touching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, from the results of the analysis, if there are more than 18 levels of the official, this scar can be eliminated. Among the 18th-level priests, Richard felt that he was sure to ask Nolan’s official to help. But when Richard looked down again, he accidentally saw a scene that he should not have seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the Dragon Master’s chest is indeed infinitely beautiful, beautiful, although very full, but surprisingly tall and straight. Moreover, it was not hurt in the Dragon Flame. I don't know if the Dragon Master subconsciously protected this area, or whether the defense of this part of her magic robe is exceptionally good. Of course, the structure on the chest may be one of the factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I saw this scenery, Richard quickly accelerated the response to the physical appearance of the body. He screamed in his heart that he didn't know if he was discovered by Lina. Although Lina turned her face at this time, she turned the scarred side to the side, and did not seem to notice the movement of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now that’s the end of the matter, Richard still looked at her all over the body and found that most of the scars and potential injuries were made by Nolan. Healing, only the scar on the face is difficult to eliminate, but it can also be greatly slowed down. This way, Lina can even wear a half mask like the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the base city, almost everyone knows the twilight, and her half-face mask is greatly dumped, praised that it is so sexy to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after Richard was ready to wait for Nolan to promise, he would tell Lina the good news, and he made up his mind, and wouldn’t tell Lina himself anyway. How to judge her physical injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina, I have prepared a little for you. This is for you, you can use it at will." Said, Richard handed over an envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina took out the paper in the envelope and glanced at it, and immediately whispered: "100,000?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Not too much, how can you use it if you want to use it? If you take this letter, you can get this amount of gold coins from the old butler. In addition, I am going to give You can take a short vacation, you can go back to Noland, take a break, and you can buy something you like. But the time can't be too long, at most you can only leave you for four days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina spit out her tongue like a little girl and smiled happily. This is how she smiled a few times after she was injured and asked: " How do you know that I like to go shopping and shopping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women like it." Li smiled and then took out a small jewelry box. Say: "This is a small gift, for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gift?" Lina’s eyes lit up, grabbed the jewelry box, opened it, and then 怔live. She looked again a few times before she looked up and asked in some unbelievable question: "What did you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and nodded: "Yes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said this, Richard’s heart still jumped faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I like it very much." Lina lowered her head again and went to see the hand-crafted, but cheap-priced earrings in the jewelry box. I can't tell if she is looking at a gift or she is avoiding Richard's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, she did forget the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and said, "I am leaving. When you want to go back to Noland, remember to tell me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina sent Richard away, closed the lab door, then turned and leaned back against the door, breathing deeply, and my heart was in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Richard was hovering down the stairs of the Magic Tower, he wondered if there would be a day when he could make all the lies perfectly smooth. Said to export, as if they are true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when giving the earrings to Lina, Lina’s reaction has given Richard a feeling that he seems to be on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard, Nyris and Agamemnon redefined the next phase of development. The final decision was to consolidate the results first, and in the direction of the aligned tree of life, cut a relatively safe passage to connect the tree of life with the forward base. The frequency and intensity of deforestation in other directions are mainly to ensure the safety of the base city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen giant pythons brought by Richard, ten were assigned to the tree of life deep in the forest. Drive, the special magic tracking arrow once locked the opponent, its range is as far as five kilometers. Even if the son of the forest reappears, once it is locked by more than three magic tracking arrows, it will be seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the base city side, it can be confirmed that there is no second tree of life within 200 kilometers, and before the impact of the forest will is resolved, They also have no further ability to expand deeper into the forest. The magic lab left by the Schumpeter family may be a good choice, but it takes time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle with the Son of the Forest, let them clearly understand the terrible strength of the Greenson's position. The strength of the son of the forest itself is far less horrible, but in this kind of plane environment, and the extra power that the world tree gave him blessings, the situation was so terrible that the situation at that time was almost unsolvable. If it wasn't for Lina, quicksand, and Richard, they would die in the way of sacrificing themselves. I am afraid that the whole team will be wiped out in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you remove the forest will and environmental factors, it will be much easier. If the son of the forest dares to leave the forest and run into the base city, then under the all-round suppression of the magic tower, Nyris and Agamemnon can join together to clean up him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the Son of the Forest eventually led Richard to temporarily stop the radical action in the Greenson plane and instead adopt a strategy of slowly encroaching. Both Nyris and Agamemnon are preparing to return to Noland, only leaving their guards and a strong man. The rest of the troops will be brought back to Noland, and it is planned to start collecting or ordering a large number of equipment that can enhance the willpower of the will. When there is a new solution, let's open the situation of the Greenson plane. Now, this plane is temporarily a cash machine that can stably provide gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibly and surely is a double-edged sword. In the case that the positional situation cannot be opened temporarily, the real strongman remains in the plane of calm and unwilling grace. Just like burning your own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is ready to bring all his followers back to Faro, where he is the real base, and can not let the followers' precious life be wasted in Green Forest. Before leaving Greenson, Richard had to go see a tree of life and collect the spring of perseverance this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard only brought sand, water and tiramisu. This combination looks unbalanced, but it is actually extremely powerful. As long as you don't encounter the son of the forest, there is no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Richard is standing under the tree of life. And it has almost become a small construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of soldiers stationed in the camp reached 300, and the camp was still dominated by human style, including fences, gullies, and camps. Several magicians are commanding the soldiers to hang the parts of the city's giant scorpion on the platform built by the trunk. All the tree houses on the top of the tree of life are cleaned up, and the tree of life adjusts the position of several trunks in the crown to match the horizon of the top platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five giant pythons placed here, and can be quickly scheduled according to the situation to ensure that more than three mega-firepower can be concentrated in any direction during the attack. . At that time, the magical tracking of the arrows will be the nightmare of any strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such defense, Richard was a little relieved. He called the magician responsible for these giants and gave me a detailed explanation. In particular, if there are elves coming to attack, as long as they find Druids among them, or any important figures above the fifteenth level, don't hesitate, let alone do the stupid things, even with the giant python. !弩 arrow is not a problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the arrival of Richard, the elder elders have arrived in a hurry. He now knows that Richard is the supreme leader of the invaders, and this young and amazing wizard has an extremely powerful soul and can even withstand the pressure of the forest will. The elder elders secretly noticed that Richard did not swallow the leaves of the tree of life, and there was no sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your command?" The elder elder seems to have adapted to his role very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last time the woman who was violated was called Di Yi, did she come back?" Richard asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it doesn't matter. I am coming this time, need Communicate with the tree of life, this time you are still Zhu Bu. Ling Feng?" Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By coming from Zhu Bu, communication with the tree of life is good for his growth. And I am too old, it will cost me a lot." Life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and was taken to a special tree house by the elders. After a moment, the young Druid Zhubu. When he was ready, his body was surrounded by a bicolor light group, and the whole person floated up. Then Zhu Bu opened his eyes, but his eyes were just a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Powerful heterotopic visitors, I wonder if you came to me this time, what is your command?" This tree of life is as gentle and obedient as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, I need some springs of perseverance, don't know how much I can get now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Now the time from my last fruit production is too short, so the spring of perseverance can produce ten copies at most." The so-called share of the tree of life refers to the weight that can make a green elf produce offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
