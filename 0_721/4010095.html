			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the attack on Richard was quickly spread in the blue water oasis, so All parties have come to visit. Richard locked himself in the room and said that he needed to be injured and no one was seen. However, everyone saw the followers who are intact and will leave with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard pushed open the door, walked out of the room and looked up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A round of sun rises in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha squinted and looked at the sun, these days, the first time I let myself bathe in the sun. There was another sun-like figure in his vision, it was Io. The Combat Officer will always appear in the most appropriate place at the most appropriate time. It is a good place to let Richard see and the side of the sand. If you have both, it is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha just smiled and walked downstairs. At this time, Oral saw Richard far away, and was surprised and happy. He even asked: "Master, you The injury is good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a bit of pain, how fast?" Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet looked at Richard carefully, and some did not understand how the lord who was still a haze yesterday became full of sunshine after only one night. Is it right with the sand? In this sentence, the elf poet certainly only dared to think about it in his heart, but he did not dare to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some slovenly slashes this morning, and he has no shaves at all. Now there is a sturdy scorpion on his lips, with a clear sleepless night. Vicissitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, the aristocrats you have invited have arrived, they want to see you now. Also, I heard that you have been attacked, many of the blue water oasis People have expressed concerns, including Luofu adults, Mr. Tiffman, etc..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Don't finish all." Richard stopped Ola I want to report the list all over again, saying: "Please ask all the representatives of the nobles to go to the Golden Thorn Flower Hotel. I will have breakfast with them. After breakfast, discuss the line plan."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recha was once again the lord who was crisp and straightforward, and who was always in the chest, and Olal was surprised and happy. He suddenly remembered something and said, "Yes, master, there is one more thing. The Viscount, Himself, came to the blue water oasis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At the time, Richard’s pupil was shrinking slightly, and he was staring at the fighting sect Iya who appeared in the line of sight. The light of this priest is more dazzling than the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Viscount Heim is here too...." Richard was a little absent-minded and then suddenly found out that he was wrong and said, "Himm?" He also came, how many troops were there? How far is it from the Blue Water Oasis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involved in the war, Richard immediately calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural has a different face, saying: "The Viscount has only brought more than a hundred guards. Now he has lived in the blue water oasis." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this news, Richard also became very strange and said: "What does he want to do? Is it because he wants to give us another ransom? He brings How many sacred domains have come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one Sanctuary strongman, but..." Oral thought about it, or said his own judgment: "I think that the sanctuary is only for the safety of Viscount Heim. After all, The blue water oasis needs to cross the blood-stained land. If you want to be embarrassed with us, in our land, there is no doubt that only a sanctuary is looking for death. I think the viscount of Him is stupid, but he The parents should not be so stupid. Odum, the sacred knight who led the elite ride, died in our hands. What is the use of a sanctuary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said nodly: "It makes sense to say this. It is time to find a time to see the viscount of Him, and dare to run on my site, but I can look at him high, and so on!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the fire in the eyes, staring at Io, not far away, the fighting priest was welcoming the sand, and said something very intimately in her ear. Although separated by tens of meters, the real talent has given the answer in an instant, 10 cm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the distance between Iowa and quicksand is exactly ten centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bottom line, there is no pass. But in front of Richard, I repeatedly touched the bottom line. Although it did not exceed it, what does it mean? Richard felt that the already calm heart began to ignite again! But this time, his thoughts are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, all night, what Richard thought was, if the man, mother or teacher was in his position, what would he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom is very proud, will leave silently, never come back. Most of the legendary mage bundled the sand and the Iraqi Russian to feed the dragon. Only the man's handling method is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Richard suddenly took a picture of the elf poet and pointed to the Russian and Russian not far away. He said, "Is there that kid? He/milk/milk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "See! Master, I am going to interrupt his leg?" The fairy poet is also a haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "No! He is here to show it to me! In this case, Laozi is like his wish! Go, Call everyone, and the viscount of Heim. Tell Him, if you can't get it in five minutes, you can't see the good show."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drifting sand in the distance has already noticed Richard, and also sees that Oral has almost left at full speed. She faintly felt what seemed to happen, but Io is discussing with himself the strange arms of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand does not want to tell the Iraqi information about the mother's nest, so I listened carefully and explained it. And give advice, tell the characteristics of the various arms of Iraq and Russia, and how to fight with them. After all, Iraq and Russia are fighting gods, and they are much stronger than the sand in the war. As a god, the most perverted place of the sand is actually in front of the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, all of Richard’s followers have arrived, and several pastors have arrived, and the number of Viscounts is actually there, and it’s still Ask to come alone. This time, he showed a rare courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to Iowa and the quicksand, and behind him, all the people were watching and looking forward to what. They foreboded that something was going to happen this morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel also noticed the difference, so he stopped talking to the sand, turned his head and looked at the oncoming Richard, smiling confidently and calmly. In fact, his attention has always been on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! The thirteenth-level battle priest!" Richard greeted him loudly, and his voice was loud enough for everyone to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s eyes flashed in a strange light, but his face smiled brightly, and he answered with impeccable gesture: “The 12th-level great magician, morning Ok!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear such a strange answer, the sand face changes immediately. She finally found out that she seemed to have missed something. It is not someone else who misunderstands, but she and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li caressed his chin, where a dense scorpion had been born and it was very stingy to touch. He liked this feeling very much, so he rubbed his beard and said: "The representatives of the nobles have arrived, and the plan will be implemented soon. This is a real war. On the battlefield, I hope you. Listen to my command, don't do it yourself. I am looking forward to the performance of a thirteen-level grand priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russ smiles and asks: "If I think, at Should the action on the battlefield be judged at your own discretion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles equally brightly, but the words are no longer polite: "That is a stupid idea. In On the battlefield, obeying my command is a wise thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russ finally sharply revealed: "Do you think your command ability is stronger than me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the eyes of Iowa and said slowly: "Thousands of people fight, do not use their own ability, I can win you once! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel laughed and said: "Why, by you, is a 12-level magician?" He especially emphasized the 12th level. Word, the meaning of which only a few people know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Iowa appeared, it was the same as Richard. In a short time, he became a thirteenth level, and Richard is still at the 12th level, and there is no hope for promotion in at least one month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Liusha suddenly regretted giving Edo a lot of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great magician?" Richard laughed, then turned and faced his followers, facing Him, saying loudly: What? Just because I can take you from one victory to another! I may not be a great commander, but I dare to say that I am already a great general!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee slammed his fist! Ruan said: "We have played so many games together, facing the same number, the same level of enemies, have you lost?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followers suddenly A scream, like drinking a few pounds of spirits, the momentum is simply more arrogant than the street screaming. Even the twilight was called out a string of syllables that no one could understand. It doesn't matter if you don't understand it. If you can't understand it, it's right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a whirlwind, pointing to the nose of Iowa, saying in one word: "What do I rely on? By me, the builder is the royal The builder, who released the two sets of suits at the first press conference! The great magician? What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRussian face is somewhat ugly The smile has become somewhat unnatural. But he still tried to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not mean to stop here, but pointed to Iraq and said: "I don't know who you are, nor do you care about you forever. What is the status in the Dragon Hall? Since you have come to Faro, since you are under my hand, then either obey my orders or roll for me! In my army, I don’t need a high-ranking grandfather!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard!..." The sand can't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei pointed to the sand and said, "You, shut up! This is something between two men!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is awkward, she never thought about it, Richard would talk to her like this. She did not understand why she would subconsciously retreat to one side and shut her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io, laughed and said, "Is this all your reasons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Actually No!” Richard also smiled and said, “There is only one real reason for me. I hate you! Don’t think that I don’t know what you are thinking, what is the purpose of your actions. In this world, it’s not just you. "Smart people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So?" Io asked, and began to take off the battle god robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I really want to punch your nose!" Richard threw the fate of the twins, the long knife extinct and the elf knife to the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s rude!" Io smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughs: "We are Archimonde, never learn to be hypocritical! Where is so much nonsense, I don’t think you are upset, today I want to You! What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel saw the posture of Richard and couldn’t help but laugh: "You want to use the sacred fighting technique, and one The battle of the eternal dragon temple, the sergeant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, you are crazy!?" The sand is anxious. She is very clear that the guardian of the heavens is different from the ordinary priests. They do not need to cultivate at all, and naturally they will master the combat skills to a very high standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put his index finger on his lips and made a snoring sign on the flowing sand, then said: "There is no room for women to talk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand broke again, and the water splashed on the side and said: "It's true/milk/milk!" The girl, I don't know if it is hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde looked at him with a strange look, but was immediately taken back by the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not just technology to fight this kind of thing." Li stared at Iowa, extended his left hand, then bent his index finger and ticked it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian smiled: "Who wants to fight who's fist is hard? Well, then I am coming!" His smile, but for the first time some stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel strode forward, and Richard greeted as a meteor, and the great magician and the great sergeant rushed together in an instant, and then stalked! In the twinkling of an eye, the melee skills exhibited by the two people made the people watching the battle silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this still a legal person? ! More than one person is screaming in his heart. Even followers who think they know their lords are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Hey! Hey! The sound of a fist to the flesh sounded constantly, making the teeth sour. The figure of the great priest and the great magician is almost intertwined into one person, not only the fist to the flesh, but also the fist to see the blood! This is not only the competition of fighting skills, but also the contest of will, determination and physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost the first time, two figures that were as fuzzy as electricity saw red, and then they were even more scarlet, splashing around! Around the battlefield, a circle of blood is quickly filled, and the drops are shocking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, blood is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand suddenly remembered one thing, and Richard was still hurt! She took a step forward and flashed a trace of perseverance on her face. She took the book of time from her waist and replied to the followers of Richard: "Do everything! Immediately turn Io! If he dares Rebellion, killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, there is still no one to care for her. Liu Sha feels that she is going crazy, what is the follower of Richard? However, the sharp and tense struggle between Richard and Iowa is now, and even the sands that are equally good at the official fighting techniques are not daring to rush in directly. What's more, Richard showed not only fighting techniques, but also the sinister trajectory of the moon and the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the two men who started to play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it’s a scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has a full force and has used his forehead to lie on the head of Iowo! This note is purely harder in the head of the competition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of the viewers closed their eyes subconsciously! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear swayed, and he took a few steps in a row, and his eyes were blurred. But there was a fire in his body, and even the breath was filled with lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Richard spit out a bloody saliva and squatted to go to Russia. And his forehead suddenly broke a hole, blood flowing down and smearing his eyes. Richard tried to hold up the swollen eyelids and looked out through the blood curtain. In a rich red world, the opposite figure is still standing straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head is really his. Hard!" Richard snorted annoyedly, then renewed his spirits and said: "Come back!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard raised his fist again, he could not find Io. The fighting god official was full of blood, suddenly fell straight and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard realized that he had won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, the accumulation of stagnation for many days, Richard tore open his shirt, throwing clothes on the ground, barely lined, muscles The upper body, a ring of arms, the muscles of the whole body are squirming, and then a roar like a beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s body is more eye-catching, not the bodybuilding muscles that should not appear on the legal person, but the four-way crawling chest Huge wounds on the back and abdomen. At this moment, the wound has already been completely torn, the flesh and blood of the wound has rolled, and the blood and the yellowish body fluid have continuously flowed out. Through the wound, you can even see the creeping muscle fibers below! The black tobacco that could not be smothered was much lighter than last night, but still clinging to the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like he didn’t know the pain at all, just punched his fist and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde suddenly teared open his shirt, revealing a strong and terrible muscle, and screamed: "Hey! Look, this is Call muscle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing about Gangde is the two chest muscles. If you talk about it, you can cut it down and you can eat it. Gangde’s double fists were in front of the lower abdomen, and the mouth’s desolation, primitive and heroic battle songs were picked up in his mouth. His two chest muscles were pulling up and down, actually shooting the drums of the war songs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of flaunting the chest muscles makes everyone stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked full of bruises, and the upper and lower eyelids were swollen and only left a slit. He looked at Gangde’s performance through this slit. Then he gave Gangde a middle finger: "He/milk/milk, dare to grab my limelight at this time! I think you want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Gangde laughed, the two chest muscles jumped even more crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A holy light fell silently on Richard, and the blood flow in his wounds was immediately relieved, and some small wounds began to slowly close. When Richard turned back, he saw that the sand was turning his head down the book of time, his mouth whispering a spell and preparing for a second magic. Her voice is very, very light, and it seems that she does not want Richard to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode to the sand, scared her whole body and trembled, almost letting half of the prepared magic break. She only saw nothing, and her head was buried in the book of time. However, if the flow rate of the time is slowed down, it can be seen that every time Lee takes a step, the trembling of the sand body will be more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took two big steps to the side of the quicksand, reached out and took her into her arms sturdyly, and kissed her! Almost bite. If so, the magic of flowing sand has to be interrupted. From the lips of Richard, the sands taste the taste of blood and sweat. Richard’s kiss this time was like a fire, and the lips of both sides turned, and the sand was also stained with blood on his face, turning into a small flower face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are mine!" said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the declaration of such a hegemony, Liu Sha suddenly bit his teeth and forced himself out of Richard’s arms, screaming heavily to show disdain. But her hand quietly caught on the dripping necklace, and added a healing to Richard, although this magic is now useless. After adding the gods to Richard, the sand was relieved, and I remembered that there was a battle officer who was still unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and opened the book of Time. Io's injury is not heavy, and a cure is enough. But Richard reached out from the side, held down the book of the time of the sand, and then looked up and said: "Ma Wen, Kas, you two come over, take him away, and then slowly heal!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fallen priests came over and raised the fighting priests one by one and walked to the building. Their therapeutic theatrical effect is not good, but it is enough to deal with the current Iraq and Russia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf poet came over and lowered his voice and said, "Master, is it really necessary to cure this kid? In my opinion, I dragged it directly into the back of the woods and cut it." Just like that of Irvine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has been heard all by the side, and the two eyebrows stand up, they will be angry, but they are pinched by Richard. Neck, forced to turn a direction, let her away from the direction of Oral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei waved the elf poet and said, "Okay! I won this fight today, and the kid seems to be less odious." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet still wants to say something, but let Richard wave his hand to stop: "I have to take a break! Don't come!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
