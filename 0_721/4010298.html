			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull is constantly shining with a faint glow, and the two pieces of carrion are still Suddenly squirming, the statuette touched Richard's gaze, and there was a long and deep beast sounding in the soul of Richard. And the three stones, if you stare at them for a long time, actually form a whirlpool of whirls, almost sucking in the eyes of Richard! Finally, it was the layer of rot, and Richard found out that it was a strange life. It seemed to be a whole, and it seemed to be composed of countless tiny lives that were swimming in the rot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little analysis, Richard suddenly found that everything in this box has reached the level that can serve as a top sacrifice! A total of nine top-level sacrifices, this is still after Lawrence's long-lost home. From this it can be imagined that a sacred constructor, even if he can only make a fifth-order structure, what kind of richness is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is limited, Richard is out of instinct, does not move the bones of carrion, but directly grabs a fist-sized gray stone and returns to the hut . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence has already changed the tools in his hands, now he is actually holding a magic pen with his right hand, using a sharp stylus as the blade, constantly on the white ribs Cutting thorns. The medicinal agent in one of the magic pens seems to have a very powerful role in repairing the body. Wherever it passes, the white night's wound is almost recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now rehabilitating her blood. Kid, you are lucky, just look at it, learn how much you can learn. Maybe someday in the future This craft can save your life. Hey, don't be so nervous, ask what you want, my strength is very good, it can't be disturbed by your fright," Lawrence said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you look for a priest?" Richard couldn't help but ask, this is a question he has long been wondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the Daksodars is accompanied by a large number of dark and chaotic attributes. The darkness is gone, chaos is the natural nemesis of divine power, so they are Injury, the healing effect of the magic will be greatly reduced. The white night's injury to this extent, is the Noel's gods can not be cured. Only my current method, a little bit of chaotic force, repair the body damage Only then can I save people. But this time I am also very tired, hey! Is it so fun to be injured by a legendary strongman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I killed him." White night stubbornly corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence should have been angry, but looked at the chest that was still open in the night, and two hearts that were almost completely immobile, suddenly sighed and said: "Good Well, anyway, you have life, you may die. Maybe you will die soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple can restrain the power of chaos? This city Doesn't there be an eternal dragon temple in it?" Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was the dragon temple that was later established, not the original ruins of the Dragon Hall, so the effect is too much difference with the real eternal dragon temple of Fu Shide. In addition, the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple have no special reason and will not directly participate in the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused a greater Doubt, in him, this rule that seems to everyone agree is not true. The Eternal Dragon Temple not only sent a sand drift from the beginning, but later joined the two powerful gods of Iowa and Naiyou. I can spare no effort to participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contest with the Nolande giants, although the Eternal Dragon Hall remained neutral, it gave him many conveniences in the name of exchange of interests. Although Richard did pay the price of resources and sacrifices, he did not think that those rich in history would not be able to get the equivalent price. However, only he got the power to trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard asked the second question: "Master Lawrence, since you are so injured, why not go to the Eternal Dragon Temple to sacrifice? So many sacrifices can always prolong life and heal the wounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence suddenly stared at Richard, and there was lightning flash in his eyes. However, his eyes turned dim and continued to work in the white night. He said faintly: "You are still very young and have a long future. But for me, the Eternal Dragon Temple is not a panacea. In fact, the more it is. Later, you will find that the more difficult it is to get the gods you need. The reason why I don’t sacrifice is to know that even if I sacrifice the whole box, I may get three or five years of extra life. If I continue to live, I will have to fight hard to snatch more and more powerful sacrifices, and then in a mess of divine grace, I will find a pitiful two or three years of extra life. Is it meaningful to live? Since you are not willing to bow down to anyone, why bother to the old dragon? Just to live in humiliation and fear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a let Lee In a stern answer, he said, "No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know it later! Kid, remember, only hold it in your own hands. The power is the real power! Everything else is fake, fake!" Lawrence temper Become bad, ferocious roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the white night interjected: "Well, Richard, don't care about him. Even if you will encounter such problems in the future, it will be a long time later. Come, Richard, come to me and carefully observe the structure inside my body. I rarely suffer such a heavy injury, so your luck is good. You see no, my body structure and ordinary people Very different, you will do the same in the future. This is caused by different blood, the stronger the blood, when the blood power is gradually developed, the body structure will be different from the ordinary people. I am awakened by the family. One of the two bloods of the dark dreams. Agamemnon inherits the ancient Titan blood. Later, as your understanding of the blood is deeper and deeper, it is possible to make more fourth-order construction. Because the fourth order In essence, the structure is to simulate the power of powerful blood as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence suddenly said: "Kid, pay attention to see my current method!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he picked up a heart of white nights, and he’s like a wind. Fast precisely the chaotic atmosphere wrapped around the top of the site are all cut, but did not let the heart of the main vein from the body. When the blood rushes into the wound, it will be sealed by his gentle force, just as the heart is intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is concentrating on watching and remembering every detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Richard can already help Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, some unimportant parts, Richard can already handle it under the guidance of Lawrence. Until the last day, Richard personally closed and stitched the chest of the white night, which ended the long and horrible treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong as white night, at this time, I finally couldn’t support it and fell asleep. Richard covered her body with a sheet of paper and walked outside with Lawrence, only to feel the heart is heavy. When the power is as strong as the white night, you can kill the legendary level, but why not live more and more unhappy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, what are you thinking?" Lawrence threw himself into the chair and looked tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was thinking, one day I will not be like this." Richard replied. Lawrence shook his head and said, "This is not the most painful. What you should think is that one day the most important person around you will become like this." When do you have the ability to help them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to this, Lawrence seems to think of something, so he sighs heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly asked: "You are already a holy builder, why do you want to go out and fight hard? I heard that it is a legendary mage!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this incident that pushed himself down from the altar, Lawrence seems to be very calm, just faintly said: "There are always a few in this world." Personally, you are desperate to kill. Since I found him, I am telling him whether it is a legend or a true god, or something else. In short, I will say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. From Lawrence’s plainness, he heard an unquestionable determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, kid! Ask you one thing, tell me honestly!" Lawrence suddenly sat up straight, and his eyes were released. Glorious, for a moment, it’s ten years younger: “How much do you have to grasp the fifth-order magical armor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a hesitation at this moment Hesitantly said: "It's hard to say! After all, to make a fifth-order structure with at least 20 levels of magic, it is best to enter the legend. In addition, the drawing you gave me, um... I always feel a few Defects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" Lawrence suddenly yelled and shocked Richard. The old man jumped directly to Richard and shook Richard seriously. He said: "You can actually see that there is a defect, that is, there is hope!" Well, with your words, I will definitely find a way to live. For a few years! Be sure to live to see the magical armed forces!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those defects are you intentionally laid?" Richard asked, but my heart was a while. Cold sweat. If this is a little bit worse, I can't see the flaws. It's hard to say what happens when the structure is made completely according to the drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lawrence’s old face was red, saying, “No, that’s where I didn’t want to understand, just... I’ve just painted a few strokes. Anyway ...and I don't expect anyone to be able to make it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even more flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence then excitedly slammed his hands and walked back and forth in the room. Period Ai said: "That, Richard, can you discuss things again, if there is One day you really made the fifth-order magical arm, that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately got the idea of ​​Lawrence, and said: "If the fifth order The Magic Armed Force was successfully released, then its designer is of course St. Lawrence!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence’s old face immediately stunned like a chrysanthemum, excited to know what to say . He said incoherently: "This... this is really too... How can I thank you? Or will I give you some medicine for the night and then put it in your bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He was shocked and hurriedly said: "Never!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
