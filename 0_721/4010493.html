			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; () <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Karan and more wind or usual vigorous and effective, to here, The vision will suddenly open up. If you come to a wider world, Noland is exquisite and changeable, and Calando is much simpler and primitive. The terrain of Noland is not naturally formed, but After years of transformation, it gradually became what it is today. The charm of magic is endless, and there are material support from all planes. Therefore, the development of Noland is also speeding up. The nobles will try to beautify their territory before the magic power. People think that what they lack is just imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s mood is different. When he really stepped on the land of Calando, the restlessness of his heart has disappeared and replaced. To be completely cold and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to go to the Snowy Mountain Temple to see what happened. The mountain and the sea said that she would stay there all the time, but Richard said to Calando. The mainland knows almost nothing, and it is not clear where the Great Snow Mountain Temple is. It only knows the general direction. You must find someone to ask. As for the candidate, Richard has already thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the beast and put it in his mouth, and the silent shock wave was spread all over the clock, the strongest of the entire Calando continent. The world was once again alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Richard strode outside the town, and the barbarian along the way looked at him silently, his face was full of no Welcome, although the barbarians do not prohibit the Nolanders from entering Calando, they are never willing to provide any help. In the tradition of Calando, all the Nolanders are liars and thieves, of course, In Noland's dictionary, Calando is a place where robbers and bandits are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting out of town, a rather tall and arrogant barbarian youth suddenly stood in the middle of the road and arrogantly asked, "Where do you want to go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and down at him and said faintly: "I want to find you, this is what you mean or the meaning of this town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of the town is what I mean, I am now the most powerful warrior in this area..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name The barbarian warrior had not finished talking, and suddenly felt that the heavens and the earth began to rotate violently, and then the eyes were black, the mouth was full of blood and mud, and then fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of other barbarian warriors, I couldn’t see the movement of Richard. I only saw that Richard’s hand extended, and then the tall and strong barbarian warrior swung in his hand like a windmill, and then was smashed. Into the ground, and Richard has long been away, in the corner of the town, under the big tree, is sitting in an old man who has been late, just to take this scene to the bottom, standing next to the old man is a young barbarian He looked at the figure that Licha went to, and said with indignation: "To deal with a normal warrior, is it necessary to use such a heavy hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old man He smiled and said, "He is doing this for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it for you..." The youth is unbelievable and says: "He Can you see your identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said slowly: "He doesn't necessarily know who I am, just warn us in this way, let Let's not mess with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young face is firm and says: "If that's the case, then I can't let him go, I will try his skills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man raised his hand and stopped the young man who was about to catch up, saying: "You can It’s not his opponent. In addition, you can’t catch up with him now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked up and looked out the town, and he could not see Li. Looking at the figure, just for a while, Richard went invisible. What kind of speed is this, he has to say: "Elder, we can't let him enter Calando like this, he looks It’s not easy to get up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and said: “He really is not simple, so young big builder, now in the entire Noland There are not a few, well, let's go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big builder, that's not like our big totem shaman, so young." The young man was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s really not a simple young man, and he came to Calando this time, and he has a lot of murderous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth is very unbelievable and asks: "Even if you are a legendary strongman, don't dare to go to Calando to make trouble."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed and said, "Don’t take care of him. It’s not our trouble anyway.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope he doesn't want to be impulsive." The youth face has some worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man had some interest and asked, "How can you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth Thinking about it, seriously and slowly said: "So a young master, you should have the opportunity to advance to the Holy Builder. People like him must have a deep foundation in Noland. There must be more than one behind him. Legendary strong, even if he provokes something in Calando, we can't easily kill him, or it will anger Norland's legendary powerhouse, it may be a long-lasting war, and it will kill many innocent people. You have said that Calando and Noland should unite and deal with other main planes in unison. Such a war is not good for anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Speaks well." The old man nodded with approval and then stood up and walked to the room. He walked to the young man behind him and said, "Remember, this idea cannot be easily told to others." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that the soldiers in the tribe are very stubborn, they don't Learn anything new, especially from Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s action suddenly froze, and then he sighed heavily. Say: "That is not stubborn, but the belief of the tribe. It is also our belief. I teach you these things. Bringing you to Noland is to let you know what the world is like, not letting you give up faith. Although the traditions and beliefs have made us fall behind Noland, but without it, the tribes have lost the spine of the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people do not understand Suddenly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun slowly sinks into the mountains, and the last afterglow is used to paint the grassland with a red with a strong tribal style. The huge animals are walking leisurely, even on the edge of the beasts. Lions, hyenas and even tyrannosaurus are mostly lazy on the ground, and the full-fledged predators do not look at the prey. Have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is walking in such a grassland, the pace is brisk, one step is a few meters, in fact, the speed is very fast, at this speed, unless It is the top horse, otherwise it will be a little longer in the middle, and other horses will not catch up with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, but the strong world of Calando is no longer calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a certain sea cliff, Ba Li Ba Li was standing on a rock on one foot and endured the impact of the tide. However, he lost the standard and was photographed into the water several times in succession, so he simply climbed the shore and his eyes were complicated. Looking into the distance, some time has passed, and Baaliba has become more robust and strong. The muscles of the whole body, such as the iron entangled with roots, have several eye-catching scars on the back of his chest. It is the mark left after the war with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba has suffered a lot of injuries, and the barbarians’ strong physique generally does not leave scars, but he keeps these shackles all the time, To commemorate the battle with Richard, before the battle, Baalibali dreamed that he would lose to a magician who was lower than himself. So shameful, he could only use his own fists to clean, so After that day, Baalibali worked hard and was crazy. He was going to go to Noland to challenge Richard after a year, but he didn’t expect Richard to come to Calando again. The tooth of the beast god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li did not hurry to fight, but first returned to the village, washed himself from head to toe, and then replaced the most neat The war suits were quietly sitting in front of the ancestors' altars for a moment. Then they rode on horses and went to the distance. The people in the tribes watched Baalba, and they did not know who the enemy of the first warrior in the tribe was. But when he saw that Baaliba was so solemn, he knew that his heart was not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Baalibali went away in the night, a young girl couldn’t help it, and the tears kept rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep darkness, in the rotten atmosphere, a sly figure slowly climbs up, he is already somewhat humanoid, creeping like a beast Then, a hoarse voice: "Richard, you are coming again, well, very good, this time you will not have another chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the grassland Next to the campfire, a tall tribal woman looked up and looked at the towering mountains in the distance, whispering: "The teeth of the beast, it is him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She thought for a moment, hit a punch in the void, put out the burning bonfire, and then kicked the tyrannosaurus that was sleeping next to her feet and said: "Get up, let's go and see the fun."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrannosaurus reluctantly climbed up, whispered a few times to protest, then crouched, waiting for the woman to ride on the back, it actually knows how to use The small front paws grabbed the parcels on the ground, then opened the big steps and ran to the distance until they ran, only to see that it was actually extraordinarily taller than the ordinary tyrannosaurus. A half, and the whole body is black scales, exudes shiny secluded Mans at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
