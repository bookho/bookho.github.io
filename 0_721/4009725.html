			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, many powerful people in the hall secretly made the nameless power An assessment was made and a conclusion that was not pleasant was reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, walking into the group from the hall, the most striking thing is a girl who is crowded in the center by the crowd. The girl wore a singular robes of warriors with various beast patterns. In addition to the different styles and patterns of the mainland, her clothing is not extravagant in terms of texture or accessories, but it allows everyone to focus on her in the first place, just like the real king in the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's body is well-proportioned, the slightly brown skin is not absolutely delicate, but it seems to be emitting a ray of light. The hair of the long and the waist is close to black, and it is scattered at random. There are seven or eight small scorpions on the top, and the stalks are adorned with various decorations such as white bones, jewels and animal teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beauty is a mixture of stunning, wild, desolate, ancient and domineering beauty, a taste that people can't tell. The two strips of barbarian paint on the left face painted with pale pigments are unforgettable. The two pale bands, naturally, exude the atmosphere of the endless wilderness mountains, and the smearing technique is also ancient and strong, that is, ordinary people can also feel the hidden power contained in it. The real powerhouse is discolored, and they can naturally see that this is not a simple decoration, but it can't tell the saint totem that belongs to the magic pattern or the wild land. Either way, it means that a girl is never a simple identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s posture is beautiful, but the pace is never light. Every time she fell, the hall seemed to tremble with it, as if she was not a girl, but a hundred-ton-old ancient beast! Such a power must not be caused by the followers behind her, because every rhythm of the hall should coincide with the steps of the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dignitaries in the hall look different, and some are irritated by the imposing momentum of the girl, or simply fascinated by the strange style of the girl, but When their gaze began to become strange, they suddenly felt the tingling of their eyes, their vision blurred, and the tears flowed involuntarily. The savvy followers of the dignitaries want to attack, but they are stopped by the strong ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the girl behind her has been obscured by her strong sense of existence, a thin and withered old man seems to tear open the fog and suddenly into the people's Sight. He has a pair of turbid amber eyes, and he is almost too old to walk. He wears a gorgeous and weird witch robes with bright feathers on his head and a stack of at least a dozen strings on his neck. The necklace made of material makes people worry whether it will break the neck of the dry branches. The old man holds a wooden stick in his hand, which is made up of three wooden branches. The joints wrapped with cloth and animal skin are obviously uneven. The head of the stick is engraved with a vibrating snake, and the body of the stick is hung with a string of animal teeth and white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is just behind the girl, no matter how fast the girl walks, no more than one step at a time, watching him tremble, it seems to fall at any time Dead, but never fell. Originally, he had no sense of existence. Except for a very small number of people, the people in the hall did not have his existence at all. But now, the old man has directly slammed into the people's field of vision, and even squeezed out the image of the girl. All the people who want to look at the girl's face, waist, chest and buttocks now see only the old man. Zhang Gan's old face and black and yellow big teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, there are dozens of people in the hall who are involuntarily crying or frightened, and there are many powerful people. However, the local chaos is too short to exist. It is only between a few breaths. Everyone has nothing to happen. Everyone is going back to the auction booth and what to do. It is dark blue, not their own territory, and the power shown by the old people also makes them understand that the identity of the girls may not be provable at all. So this little grievance, they all laughed and fell, and then figure out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiots that would scream out at this time and on such occasions were smashed by knives decades ago, and could not wait to disturb the dark blue auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the change has not caught everyone's attention, there are still a lot of people in the hall who are studying the quality and quotation strategy of the auction. For them, this is the most important thing. Some of these people are not interested in foreign objects when they are focused on God, and some have low power levels that do not sense the threat of too much horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is one of them. He is standing in front of the dragon's neck and writing a pen, writing down a powerful number. At least from the current point of view, it seems that there are no big aristocrats interested in this neck skin, and those who want to bid are all personal strong. The current price is only 1.3 million gold coins, which is far from the limit price of 3 million in his mind. When Stevenson wrote the second place, he used the corner of his eye to see that the two faces of the original offer had changed. So he smiled and smiled and wrote the third number 0, and he intended to write a bunch of 0s in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, no hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fourth 0 has not yet been written, Stevenson suddenly felt a hot wind with a strong and wild atmosphere on his side, a sly figure appeared In sight. Before he could react, he felt like he was hit by a rushing Bimeng, and immediately flew out. All the scenes in front of him turned into countless pieces of light, and the ears filled with wind and beasts. The whistling, no other sounds can be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is a violent collision. The pain caused by the impact made Stevenson's consciousness of being on the verge of confusion, and the men also rushed over and hurriedly lifted him from the ground. The wizard's instant treatment was thrown into the Sidwin. On the head. The dragon sorcerer was barely able to see the scenery in front of him, but almost vomited blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of Stevenson, a girl walked to the booth and pulled off the neck of the dragon, shook it in her hands, and then squatted A few times, I was satisfied with the sentence: "Yes, the texture is very soft! I just took a little less clothes." Then she even put the dragon skin directly on her shoulder, and looked around, it seems that it is graceful and expensive. Shawl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very tall warrior behind her leaned over her upper body and reminded her in the girl’s ear: "His Royal Highness, money."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl stunned, patted her head and said with a slight apology: "Oh, you don't say that I almost forgot! The people on Noland's mainland are most valued. I still have to pay attention. Thank you, Gangyan. Who is hosting the auction!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence, the girl raised her voice, in fact, she did not need to improve The voice, the gray dwarf has already touched the moment of the dragon's neck skin in the girl's hand, and rushed over, waiting for the side. With the keen sense of tempering for many years, Black Gold was surprised to find that the girl's gas field was the most powerful in his life, even stronger than Su Hailun. The thick gold coin tastes, no, it is far more than the taste of gold coins, so that the gray dwarfs are so bloody and difficult to self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the gray dwarf rushing to the front, the girl grabbed a fist-sized stone from the animal's purse in the waist and left it without looking. The gray dwarf said, "This is the dragon skin... money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone ash is unremarkable, but it is lit when thrown in the air. Many silver spots, and pulled out a lot of silver tracks in the air, like a silver spider silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf is stiff all the time, reaching out to pick up the stone and seeing his expression. It’s nervous, cautious, and solemn. It seems to be dark blue at the end of each month. The look of the general financial statement. However, his hands and muscles are squatting, his posture is as hard as the rock in the depths of the earth, the gray stone falls on his palm, and the ten fingers that do not listen are suddenly not caught, they bounced and fell to the ground. . The gray dwarf screamed and screamed, and the whole body fell down. He slammed on the ground like a rock, and then his hands used his strength to stretch forward, finally finally holding it firmly before the gray stone landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
