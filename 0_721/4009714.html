			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of Richard’s tears involuntarily came out, and the line of sight was blurred. But in the daytime, he seemed to see his father's face. And on the face of the steel cast, there is a pair of quiet and chilling eyes. The word of father... does not have any warmth and kindness in Richard's heart, only hatred, cold and suffocating pressure. Richard didn't even know what kind of power his father had. Every time he remembered it, he was only described as unfathomable. If it is Gotton here, will it not look down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whenever the body's reaction can be slightly controlled, Richard will raise his head and open his eyes to see what Naya is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears blur the line of sight, then wipe it off; all the ears are buzzing, can’t hear what Naya is saying, then shake it hard The head; in the end, the weak body wants to fall to the ground, then grab the iron ring on the wall with one hand and hold the wooden bucket next to it, at least let the upper body straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha vaguely saw Naa talking about something like an old man, while carefully touching his hand on the blood parrot, never letting go of every inch. local. Wherever his hands pass, he tends to turn up large blood flowers. Richard's body is fully resisting the scene of this scene, not letting him understand what Naa is doing. But the talents of ‘precision’ and ‘wisdom’ have played a role here, and they have coldly restored all truth to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abdomen is a cramping almost fainting, and Richard even suspects that his stomach is still not complete. His body has been splashed with a lot of stains, but he can't feel it. The kitchen is full of blood and sweet taste, completely suppressing the decaying smell of old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no extra sound in the entire space. From that steel line, the blood parrot never makes a sound. In addition to Richard's occasional uncontrollable retching, only Naa's hands brushed with a slight and delicate brushing sound, like the highland peacock feather tip on the parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya speeds up the movement, and his hands instantly weave hundreds of gestures, each of which is incomparably clear. So in front of Richard's eyes, a splendid and magnificent blood rose angered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a rose that blooms on the body of a blood parrot and can even see the tremor of delicate petals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of Richard was filled with roses immediately, and when he resumed his vision, he only saw Naa holding a thin thing and handed it over. In front of his eyes. Richard didn't know what it was, but the magic lines that were soaked in blood were very familiar, and he could draw them with his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the attribute class magic pattern: primary agility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound, the overflowing wooden barrel fell over and the dirt inside splashed Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know how he cleaned up the stains on his clothes and how he left the tavern in Naia. When the body's reaction finally subsided, Richard's eyes shook the magical structure and a pile of all kinds of strange weapons. But the body and appearance of the blood parrot has disappeared from Richard's memory, and he can only remember her voice now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the beginning to the end, Naya failed to ask anything from the blood parrot's mouth. I don't know if the blood parrot really insisted on the end, or Naa did not give her a chance to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
