			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east side of the square is erected with a 20-meter-tall tower. A giant python was placed on the shooting platform at the top of the tower. The two knights were standing next to the giant python and watched the surroundings with vigilance. The tower covers the transmission array and the flight field in the range, and can cope with the enemies in a large airspace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base of the arrow tower and the ladder are very new and should be built soon, but there are many battle marks on the tower, the arrow cast from metal There are also a few repairs. Obviously not long ago, the tower was tested by the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​the floating island is not particularly large, and the visual inspection of the object is roughly an irregular circle of about 500 meters in diameter. Most of the floating islands are undulating terrain, and the highest point on the north side is about 50 meters higher than the station where Richard is standing. But until he set foot on the floating island, Richard discovered that the scene inside the floating island was not the same as that seen on the outside and even the model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a model, or standing on the eternal plateau, the floating island scenes that enter the line of sight are all mountains and waters, and trees are shaded. The landform climate of all floating islands is almost the same, but the size of the area is different. But what Richard now sees is that the highest peak of this floating island is actually a volcano, an active volcano, and the mountain pass that is covered with light gray ashes is still spewing out smoke! The strange thing is that below the light gray volcanic mountain pass, it is quickly covered by the woods, and the large pieces are deep and shallow green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the volcano, a magnificent old castle is built on the mountain, dark walls and jungle-like towering spires and black in Richard’s memory The style of the rose castle is similar, but it is less majestic and calmer, and more fierce. Outside the castle, the dense buildings are built according to the terrain. Most buildings have sturdy walls and small windows that can be a solid bunker during wartime. At several commanding heights, there are prominent eye-catching towers that cover the entire floating island within their range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the volcano, Richard did not know why the heartbeat was a little faster. The faint sulphur smell in the air also made him feel a little kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time two fully armed knights came and took over the lava and armored horses. Modred led Richard and walked all the way to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the castle is spacious, but very tortuous. Every time in the turning zone, Richard will see an extremely strong fortress. A steel handcuff was aimed at the road from the flat and long shooting hole. In less than ten meters, these powerful arrows can easily penetrate the armor of the heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people on the road is not much compared with the urban area below, there are women, even the elderly and children, but the proportion of warriors is exceptional. high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hundreds of meters from the square to the old castle, Richard saw at least six soldiers loaded with two costumes. Although they still can't reach the standard of building a knight, they are also considered elite knights. What's important is that these fighters are still very young, and there is still room for improvement in the future. As long as the physique is enhanced to carry more than one configuration position, the minimum standard for the construction of the knight is reached. In terms of the standard of five magical structures in the knight's unit, these warriors also need to be equipped with a mount that can carry two magical structures, and after a year of special training, they can become a reserve knight. . However, it is extremely expensive to carry two mounts, and this cost can train a dozen or so knights. Moreover, the combat power of the mount and the combat power of the Cavaliers themselves are obviously not an order of magnitude, so the ideal structure of the knight unit is generally a combination of a four-framed knight and a single-frame mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
