			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge formula system is only a small part of it, let Richard's head began to violently hurt, which is a sign that wisdom talent is already working at the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware that he has not yet been able to resolve the formula system of this scale. If it can, it means that Richard can analyze some The simple plane rule is, from the realm, it is not much better than the imaginary simulation rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is still relentlessly analyzing, because he has found a familiar feeling from the pile of complicated numbers, the last time there is the same When I felt it, Richard was still very young, and wisdom and real talents were just getting started. When faced with the beautiful deep blue lines like the nebula, he saw more brilliance and dizziness than countless numbers with mystery. Since then, in the next few years, Richard has been quietly comprehending the deep blue sigh, he has successfully restored some of the lines to numbers, but far from the law to find out the law, deep blue sigh There is an infinite secret in the middle, and the sixth-order structure is originally beyond the limits of the Noland's plane rule. Richard needs to restore it completely, so that he can find out the missing areas, and then he can It’s time to start thinking about a completion plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Richard found that the number restored by the nest itself is somewhat similar to the deep blue sigh, and Richard can’t tell if this is simply Feeling, there is still some kind of internal connection, but there is no deep blue sigh for a long time, and now there is a possible clue, and Richard may not let it go anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nest is incomparably magnificent, it is entrenched in the northernmost part of the continent, although Richard can see it from afar, but don’t say climbing the mountain. It takes half a day to walk to the holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City is the next target of Richard, and wants to enter the Holy City, there is no other way than war, because there is a circumstance in the Holy City. There is no exception to the iron law, that is, no one can climb to the top of the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in Richard’s consciousness, the huge formula restored by the form of the nest has stopped the process of perfection, because the upper ends of the nest are all in the clouds. Inside, a piece of critical data is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard is even more skeptical about the origin of the Hughland plane. The nest is not like a naturally formed form. It is likely to be the form of a certain intelligent race, and even Richard has a more daring Imagine that the entire nest can be a created creation. If this guess is true, then it should be a magnificent project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has no doubt that there must be a major secret at the top of the nest, perhaps like the legend of the Shulan, the nest is really It is the land where the gods sleep, because Hughland has no god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another incredible phenomenon. Although Shulan is very small, the power system is quite powerful. Normally, God will definitely appear, and it is very There may be a powerful power, even if only one god is normal, but now, Shulan is not a god, even the half god has never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Shulan does have God, and God is sleeping or even falling for some reason, and sleeps at the top of the nest, then it is explained. And if this is the case, then what Richard will get on the nest, the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, as the first obstacle to the nest, the Holy City must be removed, and there are two legendary powerhouses in the Holy City. This is the biggest obstacle, even if it is a serious injury, it is also a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard thought about the strategy of dealing with the Holy City, suddenly there was a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of him, the deep night sky suddenly changed, the clouds in the air became transparent in an instant, and a huge planet slipped out of the night. Crossing the sky, the planet is light blue, incredibly large. When it appears in the night sky, it occupies almost half of the sky. From the perspective of Richard, it is like from time to time. It fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a planet with a criss-cross pattern on the surface, some are shining, and most are dim blue and black. Spread all over the planet, not like the natural formation, it seems like a huge magical array covering the entire planet, but who can make such a big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if several gods with powerful powers join hands, it is impossible to complete such a vast project. Only an unlimited number of life, experience a long time without knowing how long It is possible to accomplish such a feat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard's shock, the clouds in the sky returned to color, so the planet re-hidden behind the night, the night of Shulan, still black, but Richard now knows, it is not a simple night . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and asked the followers of the torture scene in the temple: "What have you seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu looked up and said: "What do you see, head, what do you mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is also doubtful Looking at Richard, the other people were even more confused, so Richard knew that only the shock scene was only seen by himself. He frowned and asked: "Then you feel nothing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Io was the first to shake his head. The combat priest was very sensitive in his perception. Nye was also shaking his head. She did not feel any abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned again, and the sand came over, caressing Richard’s face and asked with concern: “What happened just now.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the nest outside the window and said slowly: "The holy city may not be as simple as we think, we are more prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Competition, with our current strength, I am afraid there is still not enough, let me think about it..." Richard looked at the temple, tried hard, just overuse The sequela of the brain has not been eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough, impossible, even if the Shulan people have two legends, but they are not in the best state, and the legendary ability does not seem worth a Mention, if it is the dragon star, forgive him no longer venture into the scope of my time mirror." Flowing sand road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the danger in the Holy City is probably not just two legends. I always feel that something is wrong. Maybe we all look down on the position of Hughland. Face." Richard tried to find the wording. In fact, now, even he does not know whether the huge planet he just saw is an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted and frowned, saying: "But I didn't feel anything wrong, but it's always good to be careful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the sand, Richard also hesitated. The sand is a god. As long as there is sometimes the power of light, she always has a great advantage. Since there is nothing wrong with Liusha, then it is really nothing. Richard is just overly worried, but there is another possibility, that is, here is the place where the power of eternal and timeless dragons can't reach, but the possibility is very, very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard decided to act according to his own judgment. Even if the planet that occupies half of the sky is an illusion, the nest in front of him will not be an illusion. It is true that the rules associated with the deep blue sigh are resolved from the shape of the nest. If this is also natural, it is too magical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and said to Senma: "You go back to Noland, call Achilles and Faschi, and let Ai Lily pays more attention to the defense of the Black Rose Castle, because I want to bring all the knights to Shulan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is slightly frowning, but Didn't say anything, Achilles plus Faschi, these two people can at least contain a legend like a dragon star, plus a hundred costume knights, and Senma, Lina, Tiramis Su, plus the same level of Io and Naiyou, the two legendary strongmen of Shulan are intact, and such a lineup has to flee, Richard has gathered such a powerful force, but still a pair Looking worried, it seems that he must have felt something. If this is the case, then it is very bad, and his feelings are out of order. It only shows that this is the place that cannot be covered by the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard was stationed in the Shurindi, waiting for Senma to bring the reinforcements, waiting for the time, in addition to meditation and drawing, Richard is standing in the highest watchtower of the Imperial Palace, staring at the distant nest to see. Seven days later, Senma finally brought the reinforcements that Richard needed. After Richard took another day off, he led the army to leave the Shulandi and marched into the holy city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City is a city located in the foothills of the nest. It is built on the mountain and divided into two upper and lower towns. The buildings in the upper city are mostly white. The rock is built, while the lower city buildings are dominated by gray-black tones. Shangcheng District is the residential area of ​​the shrine and the holy city warrior. The real high-rises live here, and the lower towns live in the upper city. Service personnel, including cleaners, servants, chefs, and servants, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy city is quite vast, it is too big for a city of just 20,000 people, the area of ​​the upper and lower two districts is almost the same, In the upper city, only 3,000 people lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
