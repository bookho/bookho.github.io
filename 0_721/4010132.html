			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troll leaves the camp and begins to read under the escort of the Berserker Curse, then wave with both hands, a group of sour mist appeared out of thin air, all the violent wild boars are covered. Under the erosion of acid mist, ten fierce wild boars screamed in pain, and nearly half of them did not rush out of the acid mist range and turned into magic energy. The rest just rushed to the troll and they were all cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troll sacrifice is a surprise to Richard, able to release six levels of magic, and is also a member of the high-level ritual during the troll empire. But since the troll sacrifice was exposed to Richard, then Richard was not prepared to let him play magic again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Richard covered all the trolls including the trolls with the same acid mist. The same acid mist was released in the hands of Richard, the area was twice as large as the opponent, and the lethality in the acid mist was also increased by half. Even so, the troll's vitality is tenacious, and the Berserker can survive for a long time under the acid mist. However, the troll ritual is not as strong as the mad warrior. Under the continuous damage of the acid mist, he will scream with pain from time to time, but he will never be able to release the complete high-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acid mist finally dissipated, the troll ritual just had to recite the curse, and a fireball flew. After the fire, the new magic of the troll ritual has just been read in half, and suddenly no sound can be heard. It turned out that Richard had released two silent exercises in succession. The former failed, and the latter succeeded in interrupting the sacrifice of the sacrifice. Then, another acid mist, and then all the trolls are covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the sword was stabbed by the twilight, the troll sacrifice did not release the second six-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over. After the war, I caught more than 20 trolls and killed three times as many. The Richards only killed three humanoid warriors and one throwing soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first visited the camp of a troll. The architecture of this camp is very similar to the military camp in Jubwal, but it is much simpler. The camp was built with boulder walls, and only a few places built a covered stone house, which seems to be used only for rituals and high-ranking mad warriors. Ordinary red-top trolls without wisdom sleep directly in the outer yard. In the central stone house, Richard saw a small stone rhinoceros, which was able to sense a very divine atmosphere from the stone statue. It seems to be the Holy Spirit of this troll tribe. In front of the rhinoceros image, there is a stone basin filled with charcoal, still braving a strange light blue flame. At the bottom of the charcoal basin, there is a thick dark red liquid that looks like the blood of a certain creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wooden mask on the wall, and some unknown herbs and bones are placed on the shelves on the wall. It seems that this is where the troll sacrifices live. In the corner, Richard accidentally discovered a few slate, which was engraved with troll texts. From the nicks, there are new and old ones. The latest one is only recently engraved with words. It seems to be from the giant. The hand of the magic sacrifice. The trolls on these slate are relatively simple, and Richard has been able to understand the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the oldest slate, the three paragraphs are written:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We succeeded I escaped from Jubval and came to the Valley of the Rest. There is also the last water and forest, and the undead forest can give us enough food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zuka has no longer responded to our call. The evil spirits have been tempting us, we need to find new holy spirits, as well as water sources.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest is half dead and the water is less. We must kill all who are tempted by evil spirits. They drink the same amount of water. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a heavy slate. I don’t know how many years ago it was printed. Although the content recorded above is small, it makes Richard deeply feel The despair of the troll sacrifices engraved with these words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second slate has more engraved content.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found the new Holy Spirit, the great Coom. The rhinoceros is willing to shelter us, and under its will, the evil spirits converge on the minions. But there are still people who are tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Qom, we found another spring. Now I don't have to kill the weak children. But the old troll still needs to leave. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few slate, still telling the history of this tribe. After Kum became the guardian of the Holy Spirit, this tribe finally got rid of the crisis of extinction, they have The water, and the ability to resist the evil spirits, although not so effective. Then in a certain year, a river that has been dry for a long time suddenly has water again!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The entire Jubval gradually regained its vitality, the forest began to resurrect, and the earth also had greenery. On this slate, a simple map was also engraved to show the river of life.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the sketch with the map in his memory and found that the river originated from a pale high ground, crossed the entire Jubvar area, and eventually disappeared into a river in the bloody land. The river is not big, but it is very important to flow through the area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the next slate, only one thing is mentioned, that is, the original troll empire The royal family, the bloody tribe, finally resisted the temptation of evil spirits, and the whole tribe was completely degraded and did not know where to go.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest slate, there is only a short paragraph, this troll sacrifice called the top of the blood, want to go to Zhu Buval to retrieve the three pieces of the ancient troll empire, but all The warriors sent to the ruins of Jubval are gone forever. In the end, the sacred found strange creatures in Zhubwal, so he built an outpost at the ruins near Jubval and built it. The temple of Qom is ready to rely on the power of Qom to go deep into Zhubwal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading these slate, Richard only feels heavy in his heart. That is The burden of accumulation over a long period of time. When it may be thousands of years of history condensed on several slabs, each smear condenses the power of countless times and years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took the slate out of the holy temple and prepared to take it for the sand. In addition, he also felt the need to talk to the troll sacrifice. The evil spirit, the missing troll king, and the Zhubulwal The anomalies seem to be linked together. Then I think that the troll capital is always filled with fading Breath, let Richard feel a little uneasy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the courtyard, Liu Sha is commanding several humanoid warriors to dig a piece of stone buried in the mud, and then Let them clean up the floating soil. This stone monument is exactly the same as many stone monuments in the ruins of Zhubwal. The only difference is the content printed on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campus Central, Giant The magic captives were firmly tied and guarded by humanoid soldiers. The troll's vitality is extremely strong. As long as it is not a cut off of the hands and feet, any serious injury can be restored after a period of time without special treatment. Not far away, Richard's little unicorn was irritating and swaying, ploughing his hoof from time to time. Its flamboyant silver hoof is on the ground, but it can crack the thick slate. Io is standing beside the unicorn, constantly stroking its mane, and the brilliance of the divine power is constantly flashing and pacifying it. The unicorn turned a blind eye to the Berserkers and the Trolls, but only glared at a few unwise trolls. If it wasn't for Io, it would have been rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
