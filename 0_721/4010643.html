The Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire, this time is equivalent to directly placing the Butcher in the neck of the Holy Alliance. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the consequence of the pillar collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no super strong balance, if you give enough time and patience, the sword can kill the half-stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone needs to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted and slowly stood up and said: "The two have done a bit too much this time. I don't think this is what your emperor means. Even if you forget the duty of being a human race, you should not be so excessive in forgetting to leave the great cause of the rising sun. In history, similar precedents have been repeated more than once, and the three empires have a moment of distress, but Not once will it be as excessive as it is now, you, this is wanting war,""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart was full of blood and deeply admired the bloody grandfather, At this critical time, under the obviously unfavorable situation, the Iron and White Duke can still call out the war. Not everyone can have such courage. Most of the time, Mingzhe’s body protection will look like a good choice, especially since they have a good foundation. The formed aristocrats and nobles are nobles. Even if they are classified under the sacred dynasty or the millennial empire, the lords’ rights to the territories will not be weakened too much, and the core rights are all there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard is actually hesitating because he is not alone now, he can’t be as impulsive as he used to be. Every decision he makes involves Thousands of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Milanese is a smile, said faintly: "Lord of Orleans, I admire your courage, but I can only regret to say that Before I came to FS, I got all the authorization of the Emperor's Majesty. I am here, just like the squatting, this line is the condition of the sacred dynasty, if this must mean war..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Miranes looked at the Earl of Kimbey again and said, "...so I believe that many people don’t mind the three empires becoming the two Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the heads of the family have anger that cannot be concealed, which is another loud slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three great empires, the Holy Alliance is weaker than the other two empire, and it is even less likely to resist the joint attack of the two empire, but at this time, When Philip was hard to heal because of the terrible battlefield, the two empires were so red/naked, and even the fig leaf was not prepared, and they had a look of the alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly closed his eyes, he was afraid that he would not be able to control a blue fire, and directly burned Milanes to ashes, Mila Nes is disgusting, and it is just an envoy. He represents the entire sacred dynasty. It is meaningless to kill him. The sacred dynasty can immediately send another envoy. The conditions at that time will only be more demanding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so, other homeowners have the same mind and nature, as if they guessed the idea of ​​everyone, Milanes suddenly smiled and said "It means that you have killed me now, and you can't change the overall situation. On the contrary, you will push the entire Holy Alliance into the abyss. If you want to do it, I can cooperate, never give up, how do you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted and slowly sat down and began to meditate. Anyone familiar with the Grand Duke knew that he had already ignited real anger. At this moment, it must be whether to fight. Pros and cons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to kill you even if I can't change the big picture." There was a sound of calmness outside the meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Richard, this is the voice of Marshal Ronald Stade, no, now it is the Earl of Rendezted, but how suddenly he appeared it's here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal slammed into the door, just glanced at Miranes casually, and let the Marquis calmly and instantly twisted and twisted, and was in the field for many years. The personal strength of the marshal may not be particularly strong, but if the momentum is fierce and murderous, but few people can match the Long Destede who is on the front line of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal looked like a power, swept over the face of the giants, and said: "The Holy Alliance can hold our own military fortress. Although I am old, it has changed. I am confused, not qualified to lead a fortress, but when a soldier is still qualified, I am willing to go to the city to stay in the city, and those who want to break into the capital of the day must go from my body. Past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of the wealthy families are all stunned. They have begun to seriously consider whether to devote all their strength to the defensive regiment fortress. The past gains and losses in the past are not so important now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milanes applauded suddenly, then smiled: "Sure enough, it is a hero, but unfortunately, Dakso Das does not know how to respect the hero, like you." The heroes of the heroes were almost killed by the Dakosodas. After hearing the war, many of the surviving Sanctuary strongs left the capital of the sun, our holy tree dynasty I also received a lot of heroes like you. I just want to go to death with generosity. Of course, I don’t need to think about what will happen after death. If the day falls, I will reach the hands of the Kesodas. You think, light. Can you be excused from death in battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long De Steader’s face flashed, and a big step had arrived in front of the Marquis of Milanese. Raising his hand to cover the Marquis's throat, he lifted him up. In front of the extremely tall Marshal, the 19th-level Marquis was like a chicken, and he did not fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dynasty ambassadors all stood up and pressed their hands onto the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Marquis of Milanese waved to the people of the ambassadors, let them not move, and then stared at Marshal Lundstedt, albeit almost I couldn’t breathe, but still said hard: "While you kill me, the empire will change to a messenger... The request will be more... I can assure you that every time you mention me, I will... ...to push the dividing line forward for one kilometer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal’s big hands are on the back of the blue veins, and the eyes are shining, and there is always the possibility of a violent temper. The Marquis’s neck was crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Wellingborough finally stood up and said coldly: "Marshal, this is not a place where you show majesty, especially because of your actions." We circumcised the words of the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long De Steader glanced at the head of the giants, snorted, and the hand was loose, and he finally took Miran. The Marquis was released, the Marquis landed, and immediately coughed, and a lot of blood was spewed from his mouth. The guards of the Holy Tree Dynasty rushed to the top, and the Marquis was lifted up. Someone sent the healing agent, but was given the Marquis. Push it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milanes swayed to the magic map, shot a flickering light, modified the dividing line, and was only mentioned by the marshal for a while. The Marquis was not hurt. At this moment, the temperament was obviously disordered, and the radiant light was also shaken, but he concentrated on the original dividing line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new dividing line and the old line almost coincide, but this is because of the scale of the magic map, the people in the field are almost all strong people above the sanctuary, the eyesight is sharp, and it has already been seen that the new dividing line has translated a very small point. If the distance is enlarged to the ground, it is exactly three kilometers. The marshal raised the Marquis for three minutes. The Marquis did move the dividing line inward for three kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Wellingburg coughed and said, "The Lord of the Marquis, demarcation is a very serious matter, you are not so good."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis coughed a few times before saying, "I am standing here, representing the sacred dynasty and the emperor, and the dignity of the dynasty and His Majesty is also a very serious matter. Any offense must pay the price. Since Marshal Lundstedt can't pay it, of course, the Holy Alliance, that is, everyone present here will pay for this price. If I want to say it, I think the Marshal used to be you. To spoiled, like a child who is not sensible, the child made a mistake, and the parents are of course responsible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ujj Marshal’s face is full of youthfulness. Milanes repeatedly insulted his dignity, and he did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the conference hall is slowly decreasing, the layers of pressure are emanating from the marshal, and the legendary powerhouses in the conference hall feel bursts, including People who stay in the sanctuary or below even find that the body's reaction is becoming dull, which is the pressure of the legendary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strong pressure is completely meaningless for those who are not afraid of death, and the Marquis of Milanese will not hesitate to die, In order to make more pies for the sacred dynasty, the owners of the family have to be scrupulous. The iron-clad and the six-storey floating island owners exchanged their eyes. The Duke of Wellingburg got up and put on Long Deshitai. The Count of De La pulled out of the conference hall and whispered something along the way. The former marshal’s forehead was arrogant and arrogant, but he was obviously furious, but he finally endured silently, with the Duke of Wellingburg leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milanes flashed a trace of regret in his eyes and immediately said, "I am sorry about the matter just now, but if you still want to show force, there is no need to Our descendants are proud, the Royal Sword of the Millennium Empire, the Chinese bishop of the dynasty and His Highness Miguel are always ready to meet the challenges of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Once out, the hearts of the family are sinking. In the current situation, the Holy Alliance can't find a character who can compete against the other superpower. Even if Su Hailun can wake up, she is actually not a member of the Holy Alliance. The Guardian of the Alliance is more respectful. It is a commemoration and respect for her to establish a deep blue and block the greatness of the polar gray dwarf. It does not mean that she has any obligation to the Holy Alliance. If she says friendship, and Su Hailun The most affectionate is Gordon. At this moment, this man has already been quiet in the deepest part of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
