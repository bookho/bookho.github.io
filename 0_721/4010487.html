In a few days, someone will pick you up and go to Lanshui Oasis City. I have a well-equipped lab there, and there is an amazing host, if there is no problem, Then I will go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" Palin stopped Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Li turned back and watched that this was actually smaller than himself, but his appearance was already the son of a good friend of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling slammed and said hesitantly: "Licha, I have lived in this city for a few years, and I have some good neighbors and friends. They live happily here, if... can you keep them happy if you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha to Palin Pointing, smiled: "I understand what you mean, and want to get some good life for the people living here. This is a good wish. I said, you can try to influence my decision, and maybe even have my own in the future. The territory, but if you want me to listen to you, you need to make corresponding contributions. The more you achieve, the more you can strive for a better life for more people. In addition, the timeglass is getting more and more difficult. In the future, more time and hourglasses will require you to exchange for contributions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Richard suddenly turned back and said, "Peilin, I am looking forward to you giving me a lot of surprises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling’s eyes fell on the pile of books on the table, and his eyes were full of fanaticism, but he still said: “I try my best.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Oasis City, a speed-type brain splits from the sky and carries Richard to the Blue Water Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic lab, Qi Qi is buried in the world of makeup, she has no make-up, and her mage robe has no decoration, a blue silk bundle After the ponytail is in the back of the head, the hand holding the pen is extraordinarily stable. On the desktop substrate, seven pieces of magical skin of different sizes have been laid. Each piece is a functional magic array. What Qi Qi is doing now is Combining these seven functional magical ones into one, this process does not require much time, it requires design and precision, and these two points are the most difficult places for low-level constructors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I completed this structure. Qi Qi entered a magical power and tried the effect. When I was ready to put it into the magic box, I suddenly felt a bit strange behind me. She suddenly turned back and saw that Richard was standing behind her. I don't know how long I have stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the dress from her hand and looked at it carefully, praising: "It’s done well, the idea is also very creative, but these jobs should not Difficult, why not give it to the people below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 shook his head and said: "The connection of the functional magic array is the core part, I I don't trust them, so there are a few people who can complete this process, but I am worried that after they learn, they will spread the design method. This is the core secret and must be in our own hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted her head and said, "There is always a way to be loyal. For example, the magic slavery reel, your main energy should be put in the future. On the design and magic upgrade, the things in these processes are handed over to others. Don't forget, when you designed this simplified version, the purpose was to make a lot of manufacturing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put down the completed structure and said, "I also found a helper for you. You can see him in a while, what are the design problems, you can help each other, well, now I will prepare a separate magic lab for me and prepare all the magic materials." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪眼亮亮: "Are you ready to do the construction? What is this time, can I see it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth-order magical armed forces will be very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪的脸有光光, said: "I Ready immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she hurried away, Richard noticed that she had a delicate sheet metal box on her desk. If you look at it, you know that it is not a box, and it is full of familiar fluctuations. Richard’s heart moves, picks up the box, opens it, and sees it is a time hourglass, lying quietly at the bottom of the velvet box. This is Li. The inspector brought the time hourglass to Qi Qi, but did not expect that she did not use it, but put it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed softly, reaching for a time on the hourglass, the hourglass was immediately broken, and the force of time was chasing according to Richard’s mind. On the Qi Qi, into her body, the body of the Qi Qi in shock, then quietly spit out the tongue and went straight to the material warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, everything is ready. The fourth-order magical armor needs more than one hundred and fifty kinds of materials. These materials are filled with the entire wall frame, and Richard has changed into loose and comfortable. The clothes have adjusted the state to the best. Even so, he knows that the fourth-order structure such as the magical armor looks at the first-class level in the entire fourth-order structure, and the difficulty is slightly higher than the life. It is impossible to say that it will not fail seven or eight times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the artifact magic pen, was about to write, the hand suddenly stopped in the air, began to think about it, the third-order magical armed forces can provide the equivalent of Richard The ability of the fourteenth level of vindictiveness, while the fourth-order magical armed forces is the sixteenth level, the fifth-order magical armed, according to Lawrence's original expectation can provide the equivalent of the 18th-level vindictive ability, can make a mage, even if it is legendary The mage has the fighting ability equivalent to the sanctuary. The magical armed forces are indeed worthy of the status of the fifth-order structure. Unfortunately, Lawrence has not been able to complete the fifth-order magical armed forces, and there are still several blanks to be processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this construction is to transform the magic into an energy similar to vindictiveness, but Richard always feels the original design idea, this part There seems to be some problems, and the fifth-order structure is missing this part. When Richard thinks about it, the image of Lawrence suddenly flashes in front of him. When the young and thin old man is young, he must be less than the current mighty. Lawrence's physique is not outstanding, and Richard is not at all a level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a lightning strikes through the night sky, Richard screams: "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden call scared Qi Qi a lot, and asked what was going on. Richard took out a piece of magic paper and quickly painted the design on it. He said, "I want to The original design is modified, you are busy with yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard will no longer pay attention to Qi Qi, but completely immersed in the structure In the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth-order construction is incomparably complex, and it is easy to modify the original design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, a blank piece of magic paper was filled with data, and then Richard shook his head and threw them on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high stack of magic paper on the table goes from high to low, and then becomes no, then Qi Qi will come in a new stack of paper, Li The draft calculations thrown on the ground, she will also pick up, and sorted and stored, these draft papers record the entire process of a four-step structure change design, the importance and complexity is no more than a new design The fourth-order structure was poor. At first, Qi Qi also tried to keep up with Richard's thoughts. She would pick up the paper she had thrown and she would look at it for a while, trying to understand the mathematics and formulas involved, but the first one. Just let her see a headache, just to understand the initial point, I found that a dozen sheets of paper have been thrown at the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heart of Qi Qi, I realized how big the gap between myself and Richard is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside the window is getting darker. The lunch that Qi Qi came to has been cold and has not been moved. She will take the good lunch out and end up. Into the meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner still hasn’t moved, Qi Qi took it, and moved in and stayed up late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost dawn, and finally, Richard said: “Get something to drink.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you want water?" Qi Qi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi comes to a bottle of spirits, and After pouring a cup and putting it at the hand of Richard, Richard didn't look at it and started to work crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 has given up the idea of ​​keeping up with Richard, she is sitting next to, quietly watching Richard immersed in the world of construction, she suddenly I feel that I don’t want to be good at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottles are empty one after another, it’s dark, and the sky is bright again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha forgot the time, and Qi Qi also forgot the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard finished a line of intricate and complicated twists and turns, and finally he took a deep breath. In front of him, he was a brand new magical armed design. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi did not go to see the design, but took a hot towel and wiped his face. Richard closed his eyes comfortably and spit out a thick Strong alcohol, then opened his eyes and asked: "Weird, how do you not interested in my structure, I will not ask what I changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi smiled lightly and said softly: "You are always good anyway, I can't read it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Qi Qi, we asked strangely: "This is not like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For so many years, I will change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
