			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked back and looked at the people behind him and said, "Who do you want?" Going to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the splash, the two ogres who are still sitting or not have no intention of moving, the challenge of this battle for them It is not big. The girl has another reason. She doesn't like the performance of the battle. Who wants to see her performance, then she wants to dig out her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stepping knight stepped forward and said: "I am going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard nodded and said, "Don't end too soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the War immediately understood the meaning of Richard, and said confidently and cruelly: "Adults rest assured, I will make the fight long enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fight without any requirements and restrictions, both sides can use their own weapons, including Armor. Black Death uses a two-handed axe, while the step-riding knight, who is obviously smaller than a circle, chooses a light armor, a small steel shield and a short sword. Immediately attracted the audience to a burst of dissatisfaction. The gladiatorial field is the collision of flesh and blood with steel. It is rare for such warriors and armor to be equipped with a full set of fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how the audience objected, with the roar of the host, the fight began formally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black death god rushed to the stepping knight, the double axe fell like a squally shower, and the heavy blow continued. In the roar of the black death to the audience, the stepping knight is like a small boat in the storm, and it seems that it is possible to turn over at any time. However, although the knights step by step, it seems that the next moment is no disaster, but they have always spent every round of offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a stormy offensive, the Knight's Shield has begun to deform under the heavy axe, and there are also one or two gaps in the light armor. Compared with the black axe's double axe, the short sword is as small as a toy. Fortunately, the two weapons have never been directly confronted, so they are still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many wounds in the Black Death, and when the Knights in the battle against the stormy offensive, they can always seize the moment of the flash to make a counterattack. The angle is extremely rough, and almost every time will add a slender wound to the black death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These minor injuries did not damage the fighting power of Black Death, but made him mad. The powerful and powerful sniper, the shocking roar, all make people bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark has already raised the pants. The whole person is on the guardrail, waving his arms hard, and the roar is even louder than the black death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark can’t wait for himself in the arena now, then use the heavy smashing violently to chop the stepping knight and then smash the pieces to Richard Go on the face. At this time, I saw that Black Death always had to put his opponent to death, but he repeatedly missed the opportunity. Mark’s heart was extremely anxious, and he was undulating between peaks and valleys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark has been completely immersed in the outcome, not seeing more details. No way, the stakes under Richard are too big, a total of fifty gold coins, or the temple gold coins! Although it is not really necessary to lose the pants, but the money is equivalent to Mark's net income for several months. Like his guy who has risen for a few years, his savings are actually pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Karon moved to Hoven and almost extended his entire head through the stands. He said, "Hey, old guy, Richard, the man, do you see something?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horwen asks: "What do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karon smiled and knew that this was Hoven’s style has always been: “His movements are simple and effective, and they are not too sloppy. The style is very hard and bright. And you see, he has no feeling for seeing blood. This is not like the guys under our hands. It will go crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovin glanced at Richard, who was watching the game with interest, and said slowly: "This is a real veteran. If you are in the squad, at least five hundred or more squadrons are leading the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caron slammed into the direction of Richard and said: "This The veteran's combat power is not to look at the level. And you see, there is more than one such character in the side of Mr. Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovin thought thoughtfully and said: "It seems that Mark will soon be unlucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karon nodded and said: "In any case, this is a good thing. But Mr. Richard really doesn't know how to hide his wealth. I think a lot of gold coins are a bit of a heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horwen sneered a little and said: "In case his intention is to make you tempted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caron's face changed, Silent thinking for a while. Then he looked around and found that many people looked at Richard's eyes full of enthusiasm and greed. And Richard seems to be completely ignorant, just watching the battle in the field with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting has been carried out for a full ten minutes, and the black death is like a cow, and even the barking becomes weak. Although his double axe is still powerful, but looking at his trembling muscles, he knows that his physical strength is reaching its limit. The knights are also sweaty, but the breathing is even and long, and the movements are still simple and effective. As the opponent's offensive eases, he moves less and less, and the number of short-swords is increasing, which is constantly added to the black death. A wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark suddenly stopped screaming, and now he even found it wrong. There are more and more flaws in the black death god, but the knights are still fighting and defending like the war, searching for counter-attacks and constantly adding small wounds to their opponents. There are even some opportunities to clearly slash the short sword, but he just chooses to cut a piece of flesh. There are dozens of wounds on Black Death, and every wound is bleeding, so that every time he takes a step, he will leave a blood-stained footprint on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the Cavaliers speed up the offense, and the style changes. Each time the shorts attack, they will cut a thin piece of meat on the opponent, let The black god of death is roaring. The blood footprints on the ground quickly became thicker, and the bloody suffocation was in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cruel tactic immediately aroused another new revelry in the arena! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Cavaliers finally used the short sword to wipe the throat of the Black Death, ending his long pain, the arena had already boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up straight, struck a few shields with a short sword, then turned to Richard, raised his arms high and declared his own victory. There are also several wounds on the Cavaliers, the wounds are deep and long, but they are not fatal and do not affect combat effectiveness. How to choose the injury is also one of the most important qualities of a veteran. The knight’s gaze was clear and powerful, and he was not disturbed by the cheers. The reason why he made the winner’s gesture was to match the arrogance of Richard’s bloody mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
