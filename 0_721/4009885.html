			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is also watching, including Richard’s men’s hands The referee of the picture. When all the horses were ready, and when Richard was ready to leave, the old man finally sighed and asked: "Young people, what is your intention for the Blue Water Oasis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled gracefully and said, "Do business, make a big fortune."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good!" The old man nodded. Say: "There are plenty of opportunities to make a fortune here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so, but I have to leave here. Before I can do a little business, I still have some Little troubles have to be solved." Richard made a mage ceremony to the old man, and turned over the horse, with his men disappearing into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the city, Richard and others rushed back to the temporary camp. As soon as he entered the camp, Richard kicked the half-orc warriors who were eating and drinking around the campfire and shouted: "Get up, go back and wear armor! I want to see you do it in ten minutes." Good preparation for all battles! Ready to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed snoring came out from behind the tent, holding a large spoon in his hand, meat The fragrance is tangled. He waved his spoon and eagerly asked: "Hey, how are you going to fight? Are you going to run or stand up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepping past him, he tapped the ogre's fat belly with his hand and said, "Go and put your thickest armor on, then prepare the hammer or tower shield, then the position battle!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed face full of joy, slammed his chest and said: "Head, you can rest assured, I will make them all into patties!" I hate mobile warfare, because the heavy armor that weighs a few hundred kilograms and has a defensive power that reaches the level of the warlord is that he will affect the speed after he puts on. In the positional battle, the Ogre, which has a heavy hammer and a magical and war song, is a humanoid device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be prepared, the coming will be cavalry, the lead is about twelve, but it is also possible to encounter the fourteen tricky guys! Their The number is up to one hundred rides. A few of you, go and sharpen the wooden piles, bury them on the ground, and point them outwards, revealing one and a half meters. You can bury one every five meters!" The middle of the camp walked, the soldiers were blasted one by one, and they ordered the task to go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp was in chaos, but after a few moments there were hundreds of stakes in the direction of the city around the camp. These simple instruments are prepared to benefit from the knights. After the camp, the experienced people did not do anything to stop, but organized the soldiers to go to the nearby woods to get some hardwood back. A little piece of wood is used for fuel, and the rest of the grass is cut and piled there. Before it is too late to fence the camp, it will be used first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement of the stakes is not too dense, as long as the qualified cavalry can pass without loss, but it is impossible to rely on the speed sprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are also ten knights on Richard’s side. It’s a real knight. It’s not a knight or a knight. Although there are only ten riders, the combat power is absolutely Can not be ignored. The ten knights are divided into two teams, each of which is on the side of the camp. Each team is equipped with several wind teeth. The rest of the wind teeth are scattered among the Orc warriors. Every five orcs are a small team with a wind tooth. All they need to do is follow and attack the target that the wind is pointing at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Richard can indirectly achieve fine control of the Orc warrior, because he can mobilize the wind from the consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the ground faintly vibrates, and horses and shouts come from the city. Several camps near the kilometer range were alarmed. The guards clenched their arms and stared nervously at the direction of the city, and there were smart people who had more torches under the banner of identity, lest they be mistaken in the night. accidental injury. Some camps that are clearly part of the big forces are not nervous, but they also strengthen their guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of fierce cavalry from the city, they traced the impression left by Richard and went straight to Richard’s camp. There are obviously good players in this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 80 rides in this team. The first one is extremely tall. Riding a black armor with World of Warcraft is in the blue water oasis. The double-headed dragon Stick, who is the number one real power figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cavalry that arrived was less than half that of Strick’s troops. It seems that in the hasty, he can only gather so many people. And his old nest is in the city, and it is impossible to take all the force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also see a fire dragon coming from the city. It was Stick's infantry, and there were about two hundred people. It’s just that Richard’s camp is a few kilometers away from the city. When the infantry joins the battlefield, the battle on this side is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the effect that Richard wants, gradually eroding the power of the opponent through a battle of **. In the rush, it is difficult for opponents to gather all the fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was night, Richard did not extinguish the lights of the camp, so despite the poor vision, I can still see the sloppy piles slantingly Waiting for an uninvited guest. Although the core members of Richard are not afraid of night battles, most orcs and human warriors do not have this ability. Originally, he did not expect any damage from these stakes, but only restricted the other party's charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the temporary obstacles in front of the camp, and apparently absorbing the lessons of the Cavaliers’ squad in front of the bar, Stick was not eager to let the men charge, but in the wood In front of the pile, he stopped the magic horse and raised his right hand. Then the cavalry moved to the left and right, and they lined up in a row after Stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilk stared at his eyes and looked at the camp in the middle of the camp. He said coldly, "Little devil, say your origin! If you have a If you have enough rich dad and honestly give up the resistance, I will only cut off your hands and let you Lao Tie redeem you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Haha smiled a few times, pointed at Strick's nose and said contemptuously: "What are you, when I am afraid of you? Let me not say my family, then my current age, the current level of Master, Don't think about it, get it on my head, my teacher will let you go? Don't think that the blood is very big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History Dick’s face changed slightly, and Richard’s words were not wrong. So young, you can release a five-level magic wizard, placed in any big empire will be a high-profile figure. No matter from which angle analysis, Richard's teacher will at least be a big magician, and even may have a relationship with several top mainland powers. And Richard's guards are also somewhat unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard’s teacher is really a great magister, perhaps his own strength is not enough to sweep the bloody land, but the status of the magician is still Far above personal strength, especially the huge temptation of magical equipment that is strictly limited in both supply and supply channels. Richard’s teacher can use a high reward to make Strick unable to stand in the bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
