			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonghui barrier, this name has never been as strong as Richard Even a few days ago, it was just a noun in Richard’s mind. It was a historical memorial. At the age of Richard, the so-called history was always thrown into the garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, this Shulan’s mind is filled with steel and blood, and the barriers are in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when you really see it, Richard will feel the weight of the wall and the invisible pressure, it is not just a wall It is also a holy place in the minds of the Shulan people. It is worthwhile to use life and blood to maintain. The pressure is not only invisible, because the impact speed of the knight is suddenly slowed down, not because the knights have problems with their will, but on the contrary, they The life contaminated on your hands is increasing rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because countless Hulan fighters suddenly emerged from the hiding place, they are madly rushing to the knights, they are doing their best to roar, shouting, even Faces are distorted by anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have long forgotten the so-called combat skills, and even more do not remember the need to protect their own safety, in their bloodshot eyes, only the immediate The enemy, just thinking about inserting the weapon into the enemy's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed at which the knights move forward is significantly slower. Every step forward, they need to kill more opponents and throw the bodies out to avoid Blocking the way forward, the knights are desperately waving their weapons, but they feel more and more stagnation, because it now needs to cut more flesh and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights began to get hurt and their wounds are getting more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also began to gasp, his face was burning, and there was a hot stream, it was hot blood, not just the enemy, but also Richard’s own The barbaric slaughter is as smooth as it is. The long knife of the quasi-artifact level will not be stained with blood, but it is now getting heavier and heavy in the hands of Richard. In front of countless enemies flying in the air, Richard is absolutely The knives and techniques that the field battlefield has created are no longer the overwhelming elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and saw that there were enemies everywhere, weapons and blood everywhere, and the Shulans were crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite squadrons are fighting as always. They have no morale or tired problems. They will fight until they die. However, Richard clearly feels that the overall combat power of the knights is declining, not only because of physical strength or Insufficient vindictiveness. After all, under the dispatching command of Richard, each of the knights has at least a small half of the vindictive reserve, and it is very average. The only explanation is that their will to fight has been shaken. No one likes to fight with madmen. The same is true for the knights, and the reason why Richard's elite knights are so fearful is that they ignore the characteristics of life and death and bloody battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the construction of the knight, but the followers’ will will also be shaken a bit. Perhaps this is just a hesitation, or a feeling of madness in the Shulan. The shooting speed was only a little slower, but each person's slight hesitation was superimposed, which had an impact on the battle. At least Richard had already felt the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Richard divided the barbaric slaughter into two, left short and right, with both hands coming out, double knives falling like flowers, and thorns in an instant Pour the surrounding six or seven Shulan warriors, suddenly the pressure is loose, but immediately more Shulan people came up, they even ignored the dignity of their comrades after death, directly rushed up the companion's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not make Richard worry, what really worried him was that the ambition of the entire Cavaliers was slowly declining and not picking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seriously wounded knight suddenly screamed and was dragged out of the ranks by the Shulan soldiers. His mount was also unclear. The body has inserted a lot of swords and rifles. At this moment, they can no longer support them. They are soft and fall to the ground. The Shulan warriors are like crazy. They dragged the knight into the camp of the party. The layers are stacked one on top of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were pressed for a moment, they couldn’t use the sword, then they bite with their teeth, grabbed them with their hands, and nailed them with their nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight of the costume screams louder than the screaming, even overwhelming the killing sound under the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his wrinkle and made an order in his consciousness. Zong Hu appeared like a ghost from the darkness. He grabbed a long gun and forced it. Throwing, the rifle entangled with black gas, silently penetrated the body of several Shulan warriors, and finally fell into the chest of the knight, smashed all the internal organs in his body, but the vitality of the knight was extraordinarily tenacious. Even with this heavy blow, he called several times, and the voice gradually weakened, which shows how strong his fear before his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard clearly felt that the morale of the entire knight group was falling again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yonghui barrier is still in front, and it is reflected in the night under the flames. It is deep and heavy, looks very close, but looks far away. Never arrive again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has finally got a sense of crisis in his heart, and if he continues to do so, even if he has seized the Yonghui barrier, his most elite combat power will be devastating. At that time, even if it occupied the entire Hughland plane, it was not worth the loss. However, Richard’s commanding ability has reached its utmost. Now it is not a command problem, but the morale and the will to fight are rapidly falling, even the most elite fighters. Without confidence, it will fall soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already practiced the cold will in the field of the field, but his knight, his followers can not do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the man is there, what will he do?" The same question, I don't know if it appeared in the heart of Richard for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a volcanic man...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly has a bloody chest He immediately took out the book of the bearer, activated the last magic stored in it, not issued, but pulled all the magic back to himself, added to the magical armed forces, and the savage slaughter also had a layer of dim. There is no red light, it is the sign that the destruction of the real name has been activated. From this moment on, every time a piece of Richard sends out a knife or sends out any magic, it will attach a ruin attribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final card of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard did something that everyone was dumbfounded: he added an illumination to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep night, the light ball that radiates the cold and radiant is so conspicuous that it is suspended vertically on the head of Richard’s head. bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of commands reached each and every one of them, and the knights and followers subconsciously obeyed the orders sent to them, so they saw another An unexpected result, according to Richard's order, the knights swiftly revolved and moved the position to the side and rear. This is an incomparable and exquisite formation operation, and any name will be amazed. Being able to change the formation to such an exquisite level has long been beyond the scope of common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the knights retreated backwards, Richard was moving forward. As soon as he retired, Richard naturally stood at the forefront of the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone didn’t respond, Richard had blessed himself with several instant magics, including Fast, Flame Shield, Remote Protection and Agile, while enabling a long-lasting blood abilities, bursts, these state magic have their own different radiance, but the light superimposed together, coupled with the overhead lighting, makes Richard look particularly eye-catching, any Anyone can see that he is a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the barbaric massacre and pointed himself to the Yonghui barrier. He simply snorted: "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I saw that Richard rushed into the Shulan warrior group, and the night sky splashed a cluster of bloody rain, a group of followers only realized it, and everyone rushed to the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre suddenly roared in the sky, the huge snoring spread out for dozens of kilometers, he slammed his chest, and then looked down, in the eyes Already a piece of blood red, Tiramisu squats low body, his body suddenly stunned with bloody radiance, and more electro-optic beating, and then violently rushed, so extremely arrogantly slammed into the formation of the Shulan people, for a time, cannibalism Excessively large body of the devil did not know how many weapons were pierced by the Shulan people, but it was unaware of it. When the warhammer swayed, he flew seven or eight Shulan fighters, then lifted his big feet and went forward. He flew three or four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but tiramisu is not the fastest, Gangde has already surpassed him, this brawny has no roaring process, even yelling procedures All of them were saved, so they rushed directly into the middle of the Shulan people, and they smothered their heads. In the twinkling of an eye, the splashed blood poured him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gang is not the fastest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard’s double-knife flies, even if he only cuts a small wound of the enemy, it will become a fountain of blood. Wherever Richard passes, it must be The forest of blood, the ocean of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is absolutely perfect, just as its name suggests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blood is not only the enemy, but also Richard, Richard always feels a sudden hot or a pain in somewhere, that means more There was a wound, but Richard now has only one thing in his heart, that is, moving forward and moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
