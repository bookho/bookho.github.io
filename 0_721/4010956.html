			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to see the history of this star family, Richard Part of the time is spent on the study of the mysterious runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious rune is compatible with order and chaos, which Richard never saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Noord language that Richard had learned before was the embodiment of order, and then learned a small part from the month of destroying the real name and the blue sky. Chaos God. The two gods are each one extreme, and the rune called the star language is a strict pursuit of the balance between order and chaos, seems to go to the other extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has understood the truth of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shi Nan must be the key to Su Hailun’s final evolution, so she attracted her to an extremely dangerous place. The physique of the stone man is not a problem for Su Helun. The legendary mage who uses the power of the star as the source of strength can freely absorb the power of order and chaos on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blatt used this news as a bait to defraud Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is who gave Blatter this magic paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sat down and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every image on magic paper is deeply imprinted deep in the soul, and the twisted and skewed lines seem to be irregular, but from another angle Look, they are the rules that embody chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, countless lines are separated one by one, flying wildly in Richard’s space of consciousness, interpreting rules one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still trying to resolve chaotic rules for the first time. The more it is analyzed, the more familiar Richard is. He asks himself to let go of himself and put all his consciousness into the analysis of these patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, in a myriad of cluttered lines, new images appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a hand with a slender, beautiful line. It made a fist and hit it forward. Then the surging force rushed from this even seemingly thin fist, rushing to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is so powerful that it directly tears through the space along the way and incorporates the violent energy from the space crack into your body, then Continue on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a punch, draw a deep wound in the space, the power across the kilometer, blasting into the distance. In front of the fist, the faint deep purple sè outlines the trajectory of the boxing force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to destroy xìng is to smash a little petite figure, but in that little body, the momentum is overwhelming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure has long been engraved in Richard’s memory, that is, the legendary mage, the guardian of the Holy Alliance, Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the person who bombarded Su Hailun, Richard also knows who it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly opened his eyes, and there was a flash of light in the library! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On magic paper, that is an indefinite handwriting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard calmed down, and all the anger, unwillingness, and regrets disappeared cleanly, leaving only the coldest reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, leaving only the last question in his heart: How far is the gap between him and the super strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Richard is the king of the younger generation. Among his generation, Richard’s achievements are high and cold, even one can No one is shouldering. Perhaps only the mystery of God is always mysterious, and St. Martin, who can’t understand it, can be a little threatening to Richard, but it’s just speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undecided, it is the representative of the previous generation, the genius in genius. If she is not crazy about her actions, she will not go to the final road of no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that era, even Philip and Vatican had to join forces to defeat the indefinite. Uncertain understanding of the battle has reached an insurmountable peak, and no one can surpass her in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is able to suppress the indefinite formation because she is also a genius at the same level, no more than no difference. Moreover, the ancient race brought Su Hailun's incomparably strong body. In contrast, the uncertain human body is too much. The limitations of innate race are the reason for such a gap between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no, he finally stood in front of Richard and let Richard never get through. And Richard, I don't want to kiss the uncertain boots for the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now ready to put everything down for a while, calmly sorting out the gains that have been made, finding out the real gap between the superpowers and then seeing how it should be make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Archimonde set off a huge storm on Noland, they suddenly disappeared like a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blat's family was almost uprooted, and all direct and close-knit branches were strangled. But a family with a long history like Blatter still has a lot of distant blood. However, they apparently could not attract the slightest interest of Richard. He gathered all the troops and recalled the strong players scattered around, and then left Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the huge bounty that is still hanging in the top of the list of rewards, Archimonde seems to have never been active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is going on, and Archimonde has opened a new exchange, releasing the sixth Midrande suit. The fifth-order magical armed forces, because the points needed are too high, so no one cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong are still rushing to Faro, participating in the war against the dragon and the demon, a large number of craftsmen and mages are still attracted by the high salary, joined to Akmen The major workshops established by Germany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of dragons and demons are constantly turning into points, becoming a stepping stone for the strong climbers. There are also a large number of powerful people who fall in battle and fall on the way to realize their dreams. But some of the strong have fallen, and more powerful people have come to the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, everything suddenly became normal, except that the legendary Master Blatter’s family was almost completely killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords of the nobility, while enjoying a sigh of relief, naturally became interested in Richard’s motives for doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more people think that Richard is delaying the time. After all, the ability of the point exchange system to create wealth has gradually become known. And Archimonde’s previous reaction to such high-profile and fierce reasons has been speculated by many people as guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Archimonde is in guilty conscience because they have lost the town of superpower. Richard may grow into a super-stronger in the future, but just like most of the sanctuary can't be a legend in his life. In the history of Noland, the vast majority of the legendary strongmen will not touch the superpowers until the end of their lives. side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superpower has a lot of metrics, including a level: 27 is the lowest level of the recognized superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the power, as long as the ability to save or escape at the level of the big lord, it is the threshold of the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rules, the super strong must at least reach the level of control at a certain level of the main plane level, so that the rules will be added to the rules. This is the root of their terrorist power. In the rule control, the ordinary rules of the main plane, the underlying rules of the sub-plane, or any general rules of the cross-plane, as long as they reach deep control, have a super-strong level of combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acmond now seeks dú lì, at least one super strongman is behind his back, which is a unspoken rule that Noland has established. And Richard’s previous madness was interpreted as wanting to show that Archimonde also has a superior level of combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more and more aristocratic lords who are accustomed to yīn’s rulings are starting to be stupid, they think that the more Richard wants to prove to everyone When Mond has a super strong, the more they say that they don't actually have a super level of combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When various rumors began, Richard quietly returned to Noland. He is no different from leaving, still thin, with a little fatigue between the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the communication magic circle underground in the Black Rose Castle and entered a long-lost coordinate, which is the communication magic array that connects the Holy Alliance Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the turbidity of the image of the magic array rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the look of Richard, his eyes flashed in surprise, and then he smiled and asked: "It turned out to be His Royal Highness, how come you suddenly want to find me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it fixed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity keeps the same charming smile, saying: "You should say no way. Don't forget, I am A loyal dog at the foot of his knees, any disrespect to his majesty will arouse my anger and madness. But this time, if there is another time, then I have to refuse to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity paused and said: "Your Majesty went to the depths of the plane to find something. It has been going for a long time. She will come back in three months. Because it is a zone close to the outer domain, where there is chaos and superiority, there is no way to contact your majesty before returning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude of accidental turbidity flow said: "I didn't expect that you were not prepared to fight with me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid stream grinned and said "I am respectful of absolute power and also a kind of crazy respect for you. You didn't have the qualification to respect me before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李笑笑Laughing, slightly squatting, said: "Well, since this is the case, then I was rude. I want to ask you one thing. Is it true that you have ever sent a picture of various chaotic creatures? The map is given to my teacher?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity first frowned, then relaxed, saying: “It’s true. Blatter brought this picture to His Highness Su Hailun. As for what reason, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently, then long I took a sigh of relief and said, "You admit it. Then, I have to inform you in advance of one thing. I am going to return to Faust. The day when I came back, it was the time when I set foot on Faust." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity was shocked, the pupils shrank, and asked: "Do you mean... enter the volcanic?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
