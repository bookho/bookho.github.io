Richard quickly interrupted Oral's words, then pointed to the middle-aged man of the red Cossack and said, "Take him out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several names The prisoner opened the door and pulled out the middle-aged man to stand in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say anything, but closed his eyes, and his breathing suddenly became rushed, and his face became paler. His breathing gradually calmed down. When he opened his eyes again, he was completely restored as usual. ahref="http://www.wkfdu.com/"target="_blank">http://www.wkfdu.com/墒撬畈 撬畈 弁敝 弁敝 弁敝 弁敝 弁敝 弁敝 弁敝 嗔诵┛ 嗔诵┛ 宄 宄 宄 宄 宄 宄 宄 宄 宄 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌 鳌The eyes of middle-aged people said, "I have no patience, so tell me now, where is the position of the Thunder's anvil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man snorted There is no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not have any expression of anger, but pulled out the long sword from the waist side of Oral, and the sword left the middle-aged man’s right arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood splatters like a spring, the middle-aged man’s face is pale and sullen, but it is extremely hard to stand upright, and there is no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the eyes of middle-aged people and said seriously: "I don't have any extra time. Delaying my time is tantamount to killing two other people." The possibility of survival. And they are very important to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged responded to Richard with roar: "then let them die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嚓! His left arm also fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the anvil of the Thunder?" Richard asked twice again, still not answered, so the middle-aged two legs also left the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sisso!" Richard screamed. The teenager could not control the shaking of his hands, but still insisted on completing a treatment and minor injuries. This magic can only slow down the blood flow of middle-aged people and die more slowly. With such a large wound, the micro-injury treatment has no effect of stopping bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned the sword to Oral, and the Elf poet noticed that his finger section of the sword had become pale, which was a sign of excessive force. Explain that Richard is not as calm as it is on the surface. In his heart, he is already filled with raging anger. At any time, it may be like a volcano! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a square towel and wiped the blood from his hands while saying to Oral: "You can rest, come back tomorrow morning." If they are not willing to give in tomorrow night, then cut off all the limbs and throw them outside the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, master!" Oral bowed his head and promised. I don't know why, Richard did not have a more cruel command before, but he did not shudder this time. It seems that within a few days, his master suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Richard left the torture chamber, the Elf poetry relaxed. He breathed a sigh of relief, and then the thick sweat suddenly rushed out, soaking both inside and outside clothes, and couldn't tell the uncomfortable. Olal glanced at the captives with a hate, cursed a few words, and told the prisoners to look at them and left the underground prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral only feels extremely depressed tonight, just like what is stuck in his chest. He felt that he had to find a place to have a drink before he could be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the room, Richard closed the door, forced himself to calm down, and tried to start meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the body, Archimonde’s blood is still roaring, boiling, giving him a strong urge to put all the courage in front of himself. The obstacles are torn apart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down and calmed the restless blood, and consciousness gradually returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea of ​​consciousness was originally an absolute darkness, and then a little blue star rising, gradually illuminating the corner of the darkness. Richard's figure is surrounded by blue stars and appears in his own vision. But what he saw at this time was not the flesh that appeared in the mirror every day, but a transparent outline, which was constantly flowing with a faint mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light mist with a touch of color is the magic of Richard now, and as long as he is interested, the wisdom talent will calculate the total amount of magic between the thoughts. Come out and be precise to single digits. As an 11th-level wizard, Richard now has a total of nearly 800 magic, and will soon step into the ranks of the 12th Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light color in the magic represents the distribution of the power of various elements. This kind of color magic of Richard is in a state of balanced chaos, without any tendency, which is also the most common kind of magical attribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the body, there are countless dense dark red networks, as fine as a spider web. If Richard observes with mental strength and continues to zoom in on it, he can see that the dark red filaments actually have blood vessels, but the blood flowing inside is hot and boiling. It is not the first time that Richard has observed this scene in meditation. He has long known that it is not a real blood vessel, but an energy that is a symbol of Akmon's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of Archimonde contains incredible power, and Richard now only awakens the second layer, and the new ability to get 'hot' is extremely powerful. In the hot state, Richard's casting speed can be increased by 20%! The only limitation is that the blood force that Richard has developed is not deep enough. Therefore, if you use the heat, you can't use the explosion at the same time, and you lose the biggest means of saving your life in melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the deepest part of the body, there is a fuzzy giant tree, the branches are luxuriant, tangled and coiled, just stretched to the extreme and melted with the dark red silk screen As one, we can't trace the root cause, and we can't see the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the giant tree spread, surrounded by five trunks, but except for a branch with some branches and leaves, the other trunks are almost all There is nothing bare. This is the manifestation of the world tree of the blood of the Elvis Presley. The five main trunks represent the five directions of the development of the Elven Blood, namely nature, element, restoration, magic star and moon force. The most prosperous is nature, which is the source of strength for Richard's natural summoning spells. In addition, the monthly strength is also slightly developed. The other three trunks currently have no signs of development at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
