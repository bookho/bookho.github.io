			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Styson. At this moment, fear has overwhelmed hatred and jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well what the deep pits underneath. What kind of magic is not used by Richard. Just trample a few times. It is possible to get rid of most people around. Including him. Their speed roots cannot escape the scope of the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sidson is only ten meters from Richard. So a little distance. Richard's instant magic can kill him two round trips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the outside of the battlefield is playing hot. The battlefield zhōng yāng is a silence. No one dares to shake. Let Richard stand there and think thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Sidson below. Most of the generals are within reach of Richard. They dare not have any action. I am afraid that I will attack immediately. Naturally, it cannot be commanded. So this 100,000 army quickly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ten thousand knights brought by Richard. Not only does it have a hundred knights. There are also nearly a thousand knights. In terms of combat power. Far more than the army of Stidson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finally woke up from the memories of the old time. When you speak, speak. The generals were relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop. Don't make unnecessary resistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals looked at each other . The final focus was on Stidson. Sidson gritted his teeth and asked, "If I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahe smiled: "That's simple. Killing you is my law." Death. I don't know who you have the confidence to resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals are pale. The death of the law is the ninth level of death magic. It is now cast out by Richard, the legendary mage. It is too late to escape in this range. As long as the strength is under the big magister. All must die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidson swallowed hard. Finally said: "I surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded. Pointed to Minnie and Sidson. Say: "You don't have to worry. You can go away in a minute. I need you to go back and bring a message to the Duke of Soram. Let him send the ransom as soon as possible. A top sacrifice. I put all the fighters here and Generals. He has three days to prepare. Of course, if the Duke can't move, then you can change someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidson suddenly shocked Have a big eye. The Duke of Som was injured. And the injury is unclear. That said. The Duke has already played with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over. The 100,000 army of Stidson was timely due to surrender. The casualties are not that big. Richard did not leave too much to stay in Sidson and Minnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Minnie seems to have something to say. But Sidson is next to it. She swallowed back to her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After defeating Stidson. Because the other two troops of the Duke of Soram retreated early. Richard could not catch up for a while. So I asked them to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dictators of the Duke immediately got the battle report. I was so scared that I couldn’t move. Invisible. Richard turned the imminent crisis into invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard. The aristocratic private army is not a problem. The difficulty lies in the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a group of gods Mu Wu is not a big deal in terms of value. But since it involves the life and death of a genius descendant of Richard. That is an absolute big thing. This kind of thing. Already the equivalent of life and death. Even if Richard directly launched the war, it would be justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now Richard has pushed the situation directly to the brink of war. And also began to kill the blood of the Marquis of Brahms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s strong blockade. The entire Brahms collar has become a cage. All the relatives of the Marquis are under surveillance. The sky is also classified as a restricted area. Xu Jin is not allowed to come out. As long as there are any Griffins want to fly away from the territory. It will be shès down by the army of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the act of blood relatives. Finally let Brahms understand. Richard has already embraced the determination to fight the entire sacred dynasty. This insight made the Marquis feel the cold of the bones. How dare Dan. A nobility. How dare and the entire sacred tree dynasty. The entire bright church is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard led the army back to the city. Retained 70,000 private troops belonging to the Duke of Soram. Count the former Marquis private army who was captured. Nearly 150,000 prisoners of war have been detained in the rì city prisoner camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers. It also means a huge ransom. According to 20 gold coins per person. The ransom that needs to be paid is close to the value of the gods. This does not include dozens of nobles with titles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidson and Minnie were released. These two rivals and rivals have now been left behind by Richard. The roots are not eligible for hostility. Richard no longer needs to step on the wound in Stidson. A relaxed attitude that can be freely released. It is the best contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard also hopes that Stidson will continue to take power. After all, this opponent is really too good to deal with. It’s a pity that after so many years, Stidson has not yet entered the realm of the Magi. So this hope is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to rì暮城. Richard continued to carry out the most basic exercises. While admiring the armor in the study. Then wait. Waiting for a new war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day. Richard received the news. The paladin of the church. The legendary strongman St. Thomas has a 50,000-member church knight. It has reached a distance of less than 50 kilometers from the Brahms territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original three-way Duke private army reappeared. Join forces with St. Thomas. Coupled with the small and medium-sized lords who were recruited along the way. Thomas brought a full 300,000 troops this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge force gap. That is, Richard can't ignore it. So Richard Chass gathered the army. Directly ushered in the army of St. Thomas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day. There is a little bit of an episode. Perhaps it is because of the fact that the dynasty reinforcements have arrived. The relatives of the Marquis of Brahms are a bit stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that Li is not afraid of the dynasty army that will come. They sent people to arrest the two most savage viscounts. Directly hanged in front of the main gate of the Dragon Wing Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all uncles of the Marquis of Brahms. In this way, he was executed in front of the Marquis. The execution of the hanging is only a small team of knights. The Marquis of Brahms did not show up from beginning to end. Only everything in the study and bedroom was ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the Dragon Wing Castle knows. Richard has gradually lost patience. The Marquis of Brahms still stubbornly refused to bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon. Richard ushered in the army of St. Thomas in a valley in the north of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire army of 300,000. It seems to be everywhere. The most zhōng yāng is the church knight. This time St. Thomas brought a whole 10,000 church knights. The white armor, the red ribbon and the cloak. It seems extremely serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are only 30,000 troops on display behind Richard. The contrast of power is extremely different. However, in the momentum. These 30,000 people are no worse than the army of the opposite church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two battle arrays are good. Richard and St. Thomas joined forces to move forward. Meet in the middle of the battlefield. St. Thomas followed by several red archbishops. There is also a cardinal. And behind Richard, only Senma was alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years left a deep trace on St. Thomas's face. Every wrinkle has a history recorded. This is a paladin that is more than three hundred years old this year. He has experienced six emperors and nine popes. His face is fortitude. Eyes are firm. Nothing can affect his decisions and judgments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richard Archimonde. Stop your invasion. Immediately withdraw from the Brahms territory. This is your last chance. Otherwise, I will Pull up your black rose castle, too," St. Thomas said in a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Thomas's tone is full of threats and commands. High above. Don't say this to Richard. It is also rude to an ordinary lord. It is obvious that the Paladin has no plan to resolve the matter peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard did not answer for a while. St. Thomas's face is sinking. Screamed: "What? You still want to challenge the dynasty and the majesty of the church. If it is not for you to collude with the heresy in the church. I think you will get this safe exit. Now immediately roll out the land of the dynasty. Otherwise, I Just when you reject the tolerance and kindness of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s eyes narrowed slightly. But don't wait for him to talk. St. Thomas added: "But you have to leave all the knights in the building. As a collateral. After you have paid the compensation that will satisfy the church. This knight will return it to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
