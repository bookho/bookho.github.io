			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is nearing dusk, Noland’s second round of positive sun The horizon of the East sank, dyed the rolling rivers and rivers with the last glory, and also dyed the floating world. Just across the arch, the city of Fu Shide still envelopes the faint golden light of Ning Xin, as if the time is condensed and the years are quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He collected the magic pen, and the magical array on the skin in front of him was glowing with layers of light, like a lake under the breeze. Another piece of construction is completed, although the effect is only slightly better than the standard, but considering the materials used, this is already a very satisfying result. He quietly waited for the magical array to fully cure, and suddenly a deep tiredness came to his mind, feeling like he wanted to sleep. Whenever this time, drinking a bottle of energy to restore the pharmacy is Richard's first choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While rubbing his temples, Richard touched it to the side, but it was not the familiar icy texture of the crystal bottle, but warm and rich. A piece of meat that is elastic. Then a soft exclamation came from the ear, and the flesh quickly fled his hand. A glimpse of Richard, turned his head and saw Coco retreat a meter away, with a layer of obvious fainting on his face, being surprised and staring at himself with a bit of anger. The place he just caught is the hips of cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel good, but not the best. The idea that Richard first came up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue, Richard always puts a bottle of potent energy recovery medicine on his hand, and drinks a few mouthfuls when he is tired. However, it is obviously impossible for the Archimonde family to provide such good conditions. A small amount of energetic energy recovery agents are strategic reserves. It is only that Richard has just emerged from the deep blue, and the habit of five years is not so easy to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you should apologize to her?" Richard thought about it, but he didn't know how to explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two assistants are next to each other, in front of them, the Archimonde family is too poor, and Richard does not think that the poor is what A big mistake. Moreover, this explanation will be believed to be a problem. Now Richard has clearly recognized the difference between the outside world and the deep blue. For example, the two assistants may not see a few bottles of powerful magical agents in their lifetime. Of course, there is no way. Imagine living by restoring energy with a powerful recovery agent. So the trick is that Richard really wants to tell the truth, no one will believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female assistant just snorted and turned his head and said nothing. The male assistant glanced at Coco's buttocks and shrugged. As for cocoa, she is still blushing, biting her lower lip, her eyes seem to be a little flashy, but she has not said a word, still doing the finishing and cleaning work as usual, just starting to keep a distance with Richard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, like the identity gap between Richard and Coco, it’s only a small matter to touch the ass. It is to change the hands-on person is a male assistant, at most it is reprimanded a few words, after the boss may even think that it is cocoa first seduce others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already understood the rules of many aristocrats and knows that if he apologizes in this situation, he may even bring trouble to the future of cocoa. However, Coco's obviously angry expression and intentional alienation, I do not know why, but made Richard feel a little uncomfortable in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic hourglass has passed most of the time, and it is the dinner time. Seeing the finished product on the workbench and the neatly stacked materials, Richard suddenly felt a little impatient. He threw the tools in his hand on the bench and stood up and wanted to go outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he just took two steps. Suddenly there seems to be something rupture in the depths of consciousness. It makes a clear and squeaking sound, and then a very dark and chilly feeling appears quietly, like a shadow scattered in consciousness. open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken aback and immediately stopped, but his concentration was concentrated, but he could no longer feel the shadows, as if everything was just an illusion. He scanned the body with perception and found no abnormalities in the body. However, Richard’s heart was full of a very weak and dangerous feeling. What happened just now, but he could not find the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy footstep in the corridor, and the blood patron saint Ma Ma appeared at the door of the three-story laboratory and said to Richard: "The master is going to see you now." Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and told the two assistants to pack the newly manufactured structure, and then with the Senma Go outside. Senma's face is still pale and bloody, and even the exposed atmosphere is still a little weak. She took out a delicate crystal bottle and threw it to Richard. She said, "Drink it on the road, you don't have much time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A powerful vitality agent, Richard is somewhat awkward. This is a drug that restores both magic and physical strength. It is much more precious than ordinary powerful recovery agents, but it is used to restore the wear and tear of the structure. Obviously, something big has happened. Richard did not ask why, but drunk the pharmacy and walked behind the Senma to the main castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha still sees Gotton in the command room, the central magic map has changed the content, I don’t know which plane, but the flowing magma Indicates that this plane belongs to a certain layer of hell or abyss, or at least a place with such attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon held his hands on the edge of the magic map, staring at the stereoscopic projection, the powerful breath constantly overflowing from his body, almost visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the map, there is a knight who is wrapped in a thick armor, except for the T-shaped opening on the visor. Any exposed part of the hand, wearing a pair of scales gloves on the palm of the hand. Their armor is astonishingly thick, and the thickness is actually more than fifteen centimeters from the edge of the tilted nails! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how much power I need to wear such a heavy set of metal enamel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knight armor styles are exactly the same, it is the most common Hastings body armor of the human reloading knight, but the emblem of the Archimonde family is embedded in The left breastplate, one embedded in the right breastplate, to show the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelan and Kade, who are also members of the Thirteen Frames, are twin brothers and sisters. Although their equipment is ordinary, there seems to be no additional bonus. However, the overall momentum is not slightly weaker than Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred stood silently behind Gotton and saw that Richard came in. He opened his mouth and smiled silently to welcome him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangton stood up straight, the eagle’s gaze fell on Richard and said, “Lee, you are here, let me see your magic recovery. How come... Well, it’s been restored, it’s good, it’s time to fully recover from the sacrifice ceremony. Senma! Go and get a bottle of potent vitality, on the road.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma went away, and Richard asked with some doubts: "What sacrifice ceremony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the Eternal Dragon The sacrifice! Your kid is lucky, just have enough sacrifices. But your luck can be said to be very bad, because there is no time to prepare for you. Hold this!" Say, Gordon puts a The black box was thrown over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
