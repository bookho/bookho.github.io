Can't eliminate it, Richard can't move on again. Richard and Neris, Lina, Agamemnon, etc. have consulted many times and can't find a good way. Although Richard's holy unicorn can provide a large area of ​​shelter, but there is only one thing in this thing, can't always send it to the forest every day, search aimlessly? In the 100-kilometer Yulin Sea, relying on a single unicorn, what year and month will you find another tree of life? And the tree of life can be moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the bat, it was once again rejected by Richard himself. Don't say that the elf shooter is a lot of flying beasts that are active in the forest, and the raptors in the sky. The weak bat is the flying piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no gain in the deadlock, and logging is profitable. Now the murder of the Green Sens is reduced to a minimum, and almost all of the garrisoned soldiers in the base city are logging. Richard’s urgent purchase of five hundred felling axe was enough. Although ordinary warriors can't cope with rock, there is nothing wrong with dealing with other trees. So now the income of timber harvested every month is close to 200,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of revenue, Nyris and Agamemnon are very satisfied. They have just begun to start their own business independently of the family. In terms of value alone, this income is almost no less than the support resources available within the family. It’s just that the money earned seems to be too relaxed and casual, and there is nothing to be beaten. Soon, Neris, who has no patience, is upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is never enough for Richard. In the three months of the Greenson plane, he not only had five more knights, but also had six sets of wild series. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not immediately form more knights, one of the reasons is that he has added five more knights, this speed is in Nepal. The eyes of Reese and Agamemnon are simply unbelievable. Richard also did not want to stimulate them too much. In addition, it is the selection of the right structure of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the trusted Archimonde freedom fighters, there are only fifteen ranks that reach level 12, and none of them are redundant. And the wild series suit is equipped with a fighter below the 12th level, which is obviously too wasteful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a strange phenomenon first appeared in the Holy Alliance, a lord with enough structure in his hand, but not enough knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard made the assembly faster than ever, mainly because some of the minor and easiest parts could already be handed over to Qi Qi. This beautiful girl has the will and diligence that she does not lose to Richard. She learns and practices almost all the time, and at the same time she can keep all the life of Richard in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the progress of Qi Qi in the construction and magic, so that Richard is shocked. She is like a prisoner who has been locked for too long. Once released, she immediately emits amazing energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪的生活, simple but not simply repeated. She is not in bed, or on the bench. If you want to add another place, it is in Richard's bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, Richard’s routine met with Nyris and Agamemnon to discuss the situation and response. By convention, the first thing is to ask the Dragon Master whether there has been any unusual fluctuations in space recently. In general, if the Schumpeter family wants to recapture the Greenson plane, the transmission channel that is opened up is usually not too far from the original base. Within a thousand kilometers, the space trajectory transmitted by the plane of the plane can be sensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lina's answer once again made the three of Licha disappointed, and the space was very stable. Not to mention the large-scale plane transmission channel, there was no such thing as a small one-way portal. Nyris simply smashed it out. He thought that the Xiong Peter family was simply not a man. If he didn't dare to send troops, he wouldn't even send a killer. How to say that Richard is also a mage, naturally restrained by the shooter and the killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s mind at the moment is only understood by two or three people. Since he was singled out by Richard, he has been eager for others to challenge Richard, especially those who can 'bull' the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another discussion about the forest will, which is a problem with almost no solution. The soul and willpower are as strong as Richard and quicksand, and it will be affected, not to mention other people. Nyres and Agamemnon are not in this position for a long time. A variety of treasures that increase mental resistance are rare and valuable, not a suitable large-scale solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as long as you can find the location of the remaining two life trees, you can directly attack the past. As long as you can capture the tree of life, even if it is dead, the harvest is enough to offset the logging for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, still the damn forest will! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment of the Greenson Plane has almost no solution. The other two tribes were not so obsessed with driving the invaders, so they could not replicate the last tactic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe only the undead can adapt to this damn place!" Neris said angrily. The undead is not suppressed by the mind, and it is indeed possible to move freely in this environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find a few undead masters..." A sentence did not finish, even Agamemnon shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Noland's history developed into the era of the plane war, the Necromancer fell forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A private plane that has been in operation for hundreds of years and has a stable and mature channel is completely an army incubator. No one knows how much is hidden inside. The army. In this way, the Undead Sea tactics that the Undead Master relies on are completely terminated. Undead creatures have less combat power than their peers, and the biggest advantage is that they can accumulate a large amount in the short term. However, in the face of the massive army of aristocratic giants who were drawn from various planes, the number of undead creatures could not be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a necromancer builds an undead army at a low level and wants to return to Noland, there is a limit. The undead, which is transformed into a plane creature, has a deep bite mark, so unlike other mages, the undead mage's cross-plane summoning also requires a channel fee, which is enough to make all the necromancers go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the characteristics of the soul of the undead master are not for the vast majority of the gods, and their own characteristics are difficult to find sacrifices that can sacrifice, so Without enough grace, it is difficult to embark on a strong road. When the eternal life of the eternal and time dragon appears in front of the world, it is the most heavy blow to the necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original large magisters chose to convert to the Lich before the end of their lives in order to continue the study of magic. However, the Lich has a lot of restrictions, and the inevitability will inevitably decline. If you can get a life extension from the Eternal Dragon Hall, no one will choose to become a Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such multiple strikes, the Necromancer is almost extinct in Noland. Only the magical holy places on the mainland, in order to ensure the diversity of the inheritance of magic, still retain the complete collection of undead spells. However, there are very few young wizards who are willing to choose to practice death spells, mostly for other purposes such as alchemy. The number of mages who specialize in undead spells may be rarer than the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
