			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the final time limit comes, nearly one hundred followers, sanctuary, The magician and the generals gathered in the combat room, waiting for Richard to announce the goal of the call. After several rounds of reconstruction in Lanshui Oasis City, the command building has become a magnificent commanding castle, and the corresponding war room has become a battle. In the hall, there are a number of magic maps hanging on the walls of the hall. You can adjust the display content as needed. The hall can accommodate 100 people at the same time. In addition, there are several offices on both sides for the combat staff. They will put a simple The command is refined into an operational plan that can be executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic bell rang, Richard went to the high platform and overlooked the crowds in the hall, in addition to the followers of their respective planes, it can be said The core confession of Richard is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes swept over the crowd, stopping for a stop on a dark-haired woman, who remembered that it was Sosler and was the first bear As one of the contents of the armistice agreement, the German family paid Richard's 'compensation'. At that time, Richard also had a short interest in the fascinating Sosler, but this interest was immediately in the constant war and rush. After she died, Richard remembered that she had thrown Sosler into Faro, basically letting her die. This time, Richard did not remember that she had contacted her, but this old days. One of the two bears of the Peter Pied appeared in the command hall, indicating that she was at least a commander of a 3,000-strong force, and was able to pull up a 3,000-strong army in the absence of everything, indicating that she was absolutely Not a vase, but a real talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Richard re-interested in Sosrel and focused on her, now that Richard is not lacking in the Sanctuary, lacking It is a legend, a general and a powerful priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is just looking at her more. Now, Richard’s palms are in power and his strength is moving towards the legend, such as Sosler’s The character is too far away from him. Now that she succeeded in attracting Richard’s attention, then Richard is willing to give her a chance and some resources to see what she can do, but that’s all, she’s caught After living in the first opportunity, I had this opportunity. Only by grasping this opportunity, Richard was willing to invest more in her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, this time to gather everyone together is to prepare for a war, a war that will change the entire plane." In one sentence, I caught the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of his hand, the area map of the deep red duchy appeared on the huge hanging magic map behind him, but the map quickly narrowed, covering the entire Iron Triangle Empire and the ancestral highlands and pale highlands. Then the Iron Triangle Empire lit up on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said calmly: "Just now, the messengers of the Iron Triangle Empire rejected my request and declared war on the Crimson Principality."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly slammed, and there was a lot of discussion. The generals’ faces were not dignified, but excited. For them, the Iron Triangle Empire is huge, but it is only Losing, not worth mentioning, even if they can gather hundreds of thousands of troops, at most it takes more time to eliminate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people’s excitement subsided a little, Richard continued: “I just proposed to the messengers of the Iron Triangle Empire if their army can break into the Principality. Kilometers, then this war is even if I lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has made many deep-moving generals stunned, and some people look different, but they think It was another idea. One of the generals said on the spot: "This is to swindle the main force of the Iron Triangle, and then gather it and smash it. Good way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard shook his head and said, "No, I don't intend to lie. This time the Iron Triangle Empire will be the leader of Salenville. He is my old rival. He knows me well, knows that I won't. I lied to him in this matter, so he will definitely try his best to break into the Principality for 30 kilometers, forcing me to admit defeat. Although I won't get anything by winning this way, I can get some for the Iron Triangle Empire. Time is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Iron Triangle Empire is just our war A goal, at this stage, we will have to break into the Iron Triangle Empire, lay down their imperial capital, and force the Empire to surrender. After completing this goal, I will upgrade the Crimson Principality to the Kingdom."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard made many generals enthusiastic, especially those who were born in Faro, especially from the Principality to the Kingdom, not just the title changes, but The real interest, which means the expansion of the territory, means a large number of new aristocrats, which means that a new family can be passed down. For the generals, this is the biggest motivation for them to fight for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers are all indifferent, they have long been used to fighting and war, and the powerful forces make them look very weak on the secular power, come to them It is said that status and power are at your fingertips, and the pursuit of more powerful power is the fundamental way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s gaze swept his followers intentionally or unintentionally, saying: “The Iron Triangle Empire is a country with a rich heritage. In this war, we will encounter a large number of strong people, and will inevitably encounter legends. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, all followers are looking at each other, even Tiramisu has become serious, in any case, the legend is a The title with different meanings, even if it is a parallel legend like the Dragon Star, is also a headache for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came from Faro were the first to be quiet, the legend in Faro, almost the title of juxtaposition with the gods, the fear of the legend is almost deep The blood and soul of every Faroese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still feels relaxed and said: "Okay, this is the first stage of the war, as for the second and third stages of the war, and so on. After I reach it, I will tell you, now, I will announce the new appointment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is a series of personnel appointments, the war includes all aspects, attack The main force of the Iron Triangle Empire is naturally led by Richard, but the long boundary line also needs heavy guards, so as not to be shackled by the army of the Iron Triangle Empire. The achievements of the ancestral highlands have to be consolidated and used. For an hour, Richard finished all the arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the magic map, the situation is very simple and concise, a big arrow points directly to the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the middle of the Iron Triangle Empire, a corps of tens of thousands of elite warriors are heading to the border area, in the middle of the ranks, Saranway Fully armed and riding in the war, it seems that there is no difference with the ordinary generals around him. The iconic luxury carriages of the past have long since disappeared, and the beautiful female wizard assistants are also missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a giant eagle flew in the sky, and after a few weeks in the air, he recognized the Saranwell in the military, swooping down and falling. At the side of Salenville, and then into a middle-aged Druid, the giant eagle Druid handed a letter to the hands of Salenwell, and Sharon Will took it apart for a while. The two eyebrows were tightly locked together. After a while, he ordered the map to be taken up, spread out on the horseback, began to study it carefully, and handed the letter to the main generals for circulation. One general only After glanced at it, he roared: "This Richard is too arrogant. Isn't our elite empire of the empire, even 30 kilometers away, can't go in, thousands of kilometers of borderline, can he defend everywhere?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was circulated in the hands of the generals. Everyone was irritated by Richard’s arrogance. The generals were talking about such a long borderline. They could be loopholes everywhere. It’s not difficult to catch one of them. I scored 30 kilometers, but then someone was stunned. I felt that Richard wanted to use this as a bait to deceive the emperor into the enemy's territory and then gather it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell, who has been burying his head on the map, suddenly said: "Li will not lie on this matter."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the generals have always been very convinced by Salenwell, some people can’t help but ask why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is no need." Salenwell said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals have a slap in the heart, no need, why is it unnecessary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the map, the long borderline turns into twists and turns, and Allenville has repeatedly read it several times, thinking about where it might be weak, where is it possible? It is a trap. He knows Richard and knows that this may be the only chance for the Iron Triangle Empire. If it can really reach 30 kilometers, it can at least give the empire a year or so, but what can be done in a year, Salen Will himself does not know how to recover the crisis, perhaps only expecting the legendary strongmen to appear in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and his deep red duchy are like a monster, growing all the time, time is always standing on the side of Richard, Saranway Now I am convinced of this, and whenever I think of it, I will feel extraordinarily weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a little tired, so he rubbed his eyes hard. At this moment, Saranwell suddenly passed an idea: "If the boundary line There are no loopholes at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction of Salonville is impossible because of this idea, because I want to arm on such a long front. The required strength will be an astronomical number, but at this moment, Salenwell suddenly felt an uncomfortable feeling, suddenly looked up and looked into the sky, in the sky, there was a small The black spots are squatting against the clouds, which is like a common black-tailed hawk in the north, but today's head is particularly dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you shoot it down?" Saranwell pointed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
