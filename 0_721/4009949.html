			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the war is over, it will take some time to clean up. On the recycling of the spoils, there was a small conflict between the people of Richard and the baron, because Richard wanted the body of the entire bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the apparent dispute between the two sides is on those heavy and strong armor weapons, although for Richard, these equipments are not of much value. Just like when he came, powerful magical equipment wants to go through the plane of the plane, always paying a huge price, so the equipment of the bear bear knight is thick and strong. It’s just that Richard can’t be too obvious to ask for the body after the removal of equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, this small dispute was resolved by Richard paying a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard recovered about fifty pieces of debris from the town bear knight and re-used it with a little fix. This will be a huge fortune, and the gold coins that Richard paid for are totally worthless compared to this wealth. If it was not for the dispute, Richard originally considered leaving several structures for the Baron family. However, since the baron's bones were not cold, the family immediately expressed hostility, and Richard certainly would not arm his potential enemy in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special aspect of the Faro plane, and the ancestor worship and the true God faith are always incompatible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many attempts, Sandrud was frustrated to find that the town bear knight itself was so over-cultivated that the soul was incomplete and could not be used as a necromancer. use. This made Richard feel sorry for the Xiong Peter family. Being able to breed a species with incomplete souls will definitely take centuries to accumulate. From this point of view, the contents of the Bear Peter family may be much deeper than it appears on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the bears of the town bear and the konjac were handed over to the mother's nest. Although the mother's nest has not yet digested the body of Sinclair, he asked Richard for the body of the bear knight and the konjac. By this time, Richard has understood that all creatures with powerful power may be beneficial to the growth and evolution of the mother nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of Gangde, the mighty barbarian warrior carried the body of the bear knight, one of which was thrown into the acid mist of the mother's nest. And what happened in the fog, no one can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day is completely lit, the loss is also counted. Originally, the coalition forces of Richard and the Baron Fontaine together totaled more than 1,500 people, and now there are only less than four hundred. There are only a hundred people left in the Shamin and Barbarian warriors, but the most painful thing for him is that all the knights in the battle have been killed, and the captains have only survived two. There are only one hundred and ten heads of more than four hundred wind teeth, of which more than one hundred are dead in the mouth of the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete victory. If luck is a little bit worse, if there is something wrong with Shuihua and Gangde, then Richard can really feel that it is not worth the candle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inventory, Richard found that the strength of his hand was very serious, and he wanted to speed up the strength, only to see the evolution of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battlefield was cleared, Richard let all the soldiers under his arming withdraw from the dusk castle, settled in the barracks outside the city, even the wounded soldiers were Brought it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fallen pastor in Kas, who has a lot of burden for the sand. Although the healing power of the fallen priest is greatly limited, they can also use the magic scroll. The sands seem to have long felt that there will be a fierce battle, and a number of low-level treatment reels have been reserved. The treatment of minor injuries and micro-injury seems to be weak, but in the face of a large number of wounded soldiers, they immediately stabilize the injury, and then Slow treatment is a good way to maximize your retention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
