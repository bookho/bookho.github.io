			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world of red, yellow and brown, looking around, There are large and small weathered stone peaks. The intricate terrain of countless canyons, caves and stone forests constitutes a natural hiding place, and I don’t know how many dangerous guys are hiding in shadows and caves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another barren land. Except for rocks and wind sands, you can hardly see anything else. At the foot of the pinnacle, you can occasionally see a few bushes of low shrubs that survive stubbornly and tragically. In this vast area of ​​hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, there is almost no river running all year round. When the rainy season comes, there will be a large number of rivers on the ground, and then gradually dry up with the arrival of the dry season. The few oases, such as the pearls dotted on the earth, have become the object of competition for all forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​blood is also rich in fertile areas, but it is in the west near the barbarian ancestral plateau. Countless conflicts and battles have made the fertile soil not producing food, only harvesting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind rushed in the face, and Richard breathed hard, immediately feeling a dry and scent of breath into the nose, with a few rough Sand grain. There are two hot suns in the sky, and the blazing sun is like a raging flame, splashing on the dry earth. Looking into the distance, the red stone pillars in the distance are like a burning torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one day ago, he was still fighting in the forest with darkness and dampness, but now leaving the rugged mountainous area, it immediately entered another very different world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this land, there are countless villains, rogues and robbers, and a slave caravan is full of hands. Blood. Most of the blood-stained land is barren land, but it is also a land full of opportunities. Many of the specialties from the vast ancestral plateau of the west can sell high prices in the human world. The alchemy and magical products of the Terran are also the treasures competing for the Zuling Plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the blood-stained land, there are rumors that there are still a few mysterious areas of life, which are time-space turbulence, no discs with strange foreign races, There are also ruins buried in huge treasures, so although the disorder time and space is also the enemy of the strong, it still attracts the arrival of countless gold diggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it was noon, and after walking for half an hour on the Gobi, the fire was sweating, and everyone else seemed to be somewhat Tired, so I had to find a shady place under the pinnacle to rest temporarily, and then wait for the heat to subside and then set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is particularly important when it comes to blood. All the horses that were taken from the Baron of Fossa were in the hands of the advance troops. They had successfully crossed the border of the Sequoia Kingdom and arrived at the blood-stained land. There are two fast beasts in the advance team to follow, and with them, Richard can roughly sense the direction of the advance team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the shadow of the mountain, a group of people immediately fell in various postures and began to drink water and sputum. Richard went to the sun, squinted and looked at the two rounds of the sun that seemed to be motionless. He shook his head helplessly and turned back and said loudly: "Let's rest! We seem to have to wait until the evening!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore men are struggling to get up and start to sort out a flat that can be rested. When they are three-pointed, they set up simple cookware and start preparing for cooking. Richard wiped the sweat from his forehead, returned to the shadows, and opened a map to study. The map is very rudimentary, and the overall outline of the blood-stained land is not depicted. Only the core areas are marked with the approximate orientation of several famous oases and camps in the blood-stained area. Obviously, the hand-drawn maps from the rogues can't talk about the accuracy. If this is the basis for advancement, it will probably deviate from the final target by a hundred thousand miles. It is such a simple map, or a spoils obtained when sweeping the temple of the god of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this plane, a map is an invaluable asset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is full of unpredictable dangers. Except for the oasis and several fixed neutral camps, the large areas are completely blank on the map, just simple I wrote a few nouns, some of which are recognized names, and some are just the names of local people. The real secrets of this land are in the hands of the slave caravans who have been here for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the corner of this rough map, Richard has outlined a short forward route and the terrain around the route, which they passed before. local. Accurate talent allows Richard to draw a complex magical array, and drawing a map is even more of a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf poet ran to Richard and asked, "Master, what are we going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li pointed to a camp marking on the map, saying: "First meet with our people. After the horse, we go to the bloodstone camp to try our luck. See if you can find a guide familiar with this belt, and find Some 'live' dry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral has some puzzles: "Why are we going there to try our luck?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "From now on, we will take root in the blood-stained place. Because there are all kinds of aliens, scum and garbage everywhere, now they are our natural Allies. Here, no one cares who we are, where we come from, as long as we have enough strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you also include barbarians?" The elf poet cautiously asked, his face was a bit unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Oral a little strangely and replied: "Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The face of the Elf poet is not just ugly, but rather pale. If Richard thoughtfully began to speculate on what happened to the elf poet, he would have such a strong psychological shadow on the barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing Oral, Richard went to the ogre Tiramisu and patted him, saying: "More copies of magic scrolls." I heard that this thing is too expensive to die in this plane, we can all count on this fortune. In addition, copying the magic scroll also helps the magic grow, when will your mage level be promoted?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu grabbed his head and said, "About another month, I am a tenth mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ogre is different from human beings, and their magic is less than that of the same level. The tenth mage is roughly equivalent to the human eightth mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Yes! But I am very much looking forward to the day you reach the 12th level!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th-level ogre is likely to mutate, including a race-like variation that grows again, or a special blood-capacity variation that can be encountered. Even the most common two-headed ogre variant is good, at least the speed of the tiramisu cast will be much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a big lap and a few words with everyone, Richard found a place to sit down, take out a piece of animal skin and continue to draw this The frame is not finished. After this period of experience, Richard has fully adapted to draw the structure in various environments, whether it is the dark blue limited edition gnome royal special smelting platform, or the small table of Archimonde floating island 30 years ago, Even the stone, which is only a flat stone, is exactly the same for him, and it does not affect the precision of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
