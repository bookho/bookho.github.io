It’s just that he is now building the structure not only to sell money, but also to design the knights, tailor-made for himself and his followers, and to create and make suits, and how to do a lot of initial agility, only for A special boutique with a small probability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he can build a dedicated studio like the majority of Noland’s builders, build several stable procurement and sales channels, and then concentrate on it. Research and sharpen skills. But that is not the path that Richard chose for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial agile is not something that no one can do. Any sacred master, as well as skilled masters, have an organic rate, rare. The reason is that no one who can do it will waste time and energy to do it. The reason is the same as that of Richard. It is only possible to produce a fine product occasionally if you want to make a bunch of initial agility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard’s initial agile can sell millions of coins, but it’s not so easy to get. At least Luna, another royal architect of the Holy Alliance, can't do it for years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Agamemnon finally couldn’t stand it, and said to Richard: "He has something to ask for, so he is out of order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agamemnon, you! You!" Neris almost jumped up. But he looked back at Richard's face and sat down and said, "Well, I do have something for you. I think... I want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Agamemnon also said: "He wants to fight with you in the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think it was this thing, frowning Repeatedly thinking about the true motives of Nyris. He has too many secrets in Faro, which is completely incomprehensible. And Neris is, after all, a prince, and he is so close to him that if he is not good, he will be involved in the battle of the Crown Prince. This is a big taboo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris stared at Agamemnon hatefully, and that look was like a slap in the face. But how can Agamemnon put his threat of innocence in his eyes and continue to say to Richard: "The real idea of ​​Nyris is to make money with you in the plane war to strengthen him. Your own power and increase your points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Points?" Richard heard a very strange word that sounded like Su Hailun's style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, explaining the points system is a rather sloppy job, and Agamemnon is absolutely unwilling to do this. Therefore, Nyris had to explain to Richard in detail the latest system of points implemented by the Royal Government. This includes elements such as achievement redemption, time weighting, moving averages, and even the distribution of results. To make a system so complicated is obviously to exclude those who are not so smart, which is obviously a dark blue style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nyres immediately showed a good ability, the system was clearly explained in a clear and concise manner, obviously how to maximize the use of this set of rules Have experience. Nyris's conclusion is very simple. To participate in the plane war, it is the quickest way to expand his army and forces through the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is also the hardest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether the plane war wants to finally gain the uncertainty of actual interests, the emperor's emperors are vying for the storage position, not to say that merely becoming a good general or a plane war leader is enough. If you immerse yourself in the whirlpool of the plane war, and involve too much energy and resources, you may lose the first hand and advantage in the floating world. So unless you find a reliable and powerful agent, the emperors will not run to develop a new plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the emperor honed their ability to play chess instead of jumping on the board to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When explaining the points system, Nyris looked at Richard and said seriously: "But I must remind you, Richard, if you agree with me If you ask, you may be considered by others to support me, so you may be rejected by other emperors. It may even be a direct blow! If you don't want to interfere with the struggle inside the royal family and refuse me, I won't mind." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat still, his eyebrows locked, constantly thinking about the pros and cons. He has no experience in dealing with such issues involving high-level politics. If Gordon is present, he should be able to give Richard a lot of guidance. At this time, Agamemnon said: "In the history of the Holy Alliance, only families without strength will evade this struggle. "He suddenly showed a sunny smile and a calm smile. "Richard, you can get it now, that is, your own branch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The potential meaning of the sentence seems to be offensive to Richard, and Agamemnon did not really regard him as the helm of Akmon's family. But this is also an undeniable fact. Even though Richard now supports the facade of Archimonde's floating island, in fact, even the power of the department of Gordon can not be controlled and used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Agamemnon is reminding Richard that if he now supports Nyris, it is only a personal act that still does not affect the family. Even if it is affected, the loss is not as great as that imagined. Just as Agamemnon is next to Nyris, it does not mean that the Duke of Iron and Blood is used by the Four Emperors. I have to say that this young man who often refines his language to Jane has a good eloquence and often focuses on the key points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly speaking, there is not much that Richard can lose now, but winning can win a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi also said at this time: "It is true. Choosing to support the emperor is the right and obligation of every giant, they need to choose a more qualified for the empire. The future king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then made up his mind. Although Agamemnon is talking about the branch, Fass is referring to the family, but the meaning is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is still related to the family strength, even if it supports the wrong object, but as long as the family strength is strong enough, the emperor should also be careful not to repeat it. It is commonplace to make extraordinary things, and the differences between the positions of a family's branches are commonplace. In essence, the emperor is only the largest aristocrat. Some aristocrats have a family history that is even longer than the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then what can I get in this matter?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is overjoyed and said: "You need to provide a developmental plane, we fight together. My reward is that it will provide for that plane." The leisurely grace, and all the gains in that plane will be divided into half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal." Richard did not think too much about the gains and losses, but added One sentence: "I will take out the Greenson plane. It is the plane we visited last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green Sen? Is your main plane not Faro? But Greenson is indeed a very valuable plane. Unfortunately, Xiong Peter spent more than a decade and did not develop much results. I heard that the indigenous people there are very Trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I think Greenson is more suitable. Faro’s situation is now stable, and it is necessary to digest the results for the time being. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon looked at each other and asked, "Would you go with us to Greenson?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Richard smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the most important thing was finalized, the three men became significantly more relaxed and began to chat casually. In fact, there are eight sentences in ten sentences. Nyris is saying that Richard can only insert one or two sentences. Agamemnon only took a few words in a half-day, and the content was mostly revealed by Neri's cowhide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after chatting for a while, Nyris and Agamemnon all saw that Richard’s mood seemed to be wrong, so he asked, Richard is just I smiled and explained that I have always been inexplicably irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon and Nyris were thoughtful and looked at each other, then Agamemnon slightly nodded. So Nyris told Richard that there was a way to solve it, but it would take a while to help him deal with the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lunch is finally over, and Richard has ordered a number of weapons and equipment to Nyris and Agamemnon. It took time to prepare for the plane war, so Nyris planned a ten-day period to assemble the troops that belonged to him. Before entering the Greenson plane, Nyris will also hold a sacrifice in an attempt to gain a calm and graceful effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the floating island, just after dinner, Richard received a letter from White Night with only one sentence: "Tomorrow at noon, I Take you to the absolute battlefield to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolute battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is said to be a melting pot for the tempering of the Sanctuary, and the only way to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last hundred years, almost all of the mainland's new legends have come from the field of extinction. It is almost because there is only one exception known to the mainland of Noland, Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the history of this legendary mage, she appeared in the vision of mainland sentient beings with the deep blue establishment war. This woman does not seem to need to be tempered, nor has it been painstakingly repaired. When it appears, it has thwarted the fierce polar gray dwarf, and then it became a legend. And as soon as she enters the legendary realm, she still maintains an incomparable momentum, reflecting the terrible strength far beyond the same kind, and the number of legendary powers who have been abused by the legendary mage to the psychological shadow is absolutely many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no explanation for the white night, Richard knows that most of the white nights are at the request of Agamemnon, in order to solve their own psychological problems. Otherwise, she will not suddenly propose to take herself to the absolute battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard does not understand what is inexplicable and has nothing to do with the battlefield, but the opportunity to see the battlefield in advance is not to be missed. Richard immediately called the old housekeeper into the study and handed him a list of all the potions, so that the old butler managed to buy it by noon tomorrow. This extremely effective recovery agent, Archimonde, has no capacity to produce and does not have any stock. The efficacious pharmacy is a bottle of tens of thousands of gold coins. Archimonde can't wait to use one gold coin as two. Of course, it is impossible to store it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
