			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the suggestion of turbidity. The loyal palace manager wanted Richard to go to the dusk to see it anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard said: "I will go to the field to see the battlefield and see what Hetins has done. What are the great things? They are the most It's good and effective. If the effect is not good, then I may give this guy a deep enough lesson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, I will hand it over to you." Look at the shoulders of Achilles, pick up the knife and pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard walked out of the portal of the rising sun. As soon as he came out of the portal, he lifted off and then disappeared a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Sanctuary guarding the portal was shocked. They have never seen a Master who is so powerful in space, actually cast a forbidden field. The Legion Fortress can also be transmitted so easily. At this time, the sender's authentication information fell into their hands, with a prominent name, Richard Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the army of Heitings is leaving from a fortress corps that has been razed to the next goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army is composed entirely of warriors covered in black armor, and they are marching at a constant speed toward Daxor at a steady and mechanical pace. The next regiment fortress of the Das is advancing. Each soldier in this army has the power of the Sanctuary level, and the number is as many as eight thousand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most terrible thing is not only the number, but also that it is an army, an army with a strict military discipline to fight with the creator! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a large number of such powerful people are turned into an army, there is an invincible force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the army, walking a huge and awkward earth dragon. The shape of this dragon is several times larger than that of the ordinary dragon. Each step will cause a big earthquake. On the back of the dragon, a miniature magic tower was built. Hettings is manipulating the direction of the entire army in the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriented by such a large army, and has just captured a military fortress, martial arts is comparable to Philippe the Great, but at this moment, the face of Heatings is not very beautiful. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle at the last regiment fortress was not very smooth. Although the number of Dakso Dasians is not dominant, but the scheming, all kinds of tricks, and all of them are not afraid of death, with the defensive advantage of the Legion Fortress, causing huge losses to the army of Heitings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings has smashed the two legends in the fortress, more than 500 sacred warriors, and thousands of cannon fodders below the Sanctuary. The price is up to two thousand people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the war, Heitings was inconvenient to command, and the single weakness of the unit was exposed and fully utilized by the Dakosodas. It was this war that made Heitings deeply aware that the outcome of war is not like research, but a comparison of the digital power of both sides. Arms and command have an important role. War is art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heitings’ distress is that, if he continues to do so, his troops will consume up to three or four fortresses and lose them. Without these strong men, although the mother emperor still has enough soldiers to reserve, but there are not enough strong souls to stimulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to destroy two-thirds of the Dakosudas’s regiment’s fortress is also a martial art. However, Heitings's ambition is far more than this. His dream is to sway the entire dusk and establish a forward base in the Dakosodas plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his research, the Dakosodas plane is likely to contain some of the ultimate mystery of life. To solve this mystery, Heitings is at least super hopeful, and may still be able to obtain the right to eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it’s just a time in the field, it’s not enough to support the dream of Heitings. And the support from Solomon Castle is likely to become a noose hanging around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings are very afraid of the scholars of Solomonsburg, who have devoted themselves to research for a lifetime, knowing that guys who are truly fascinated with knowledge and research can change How crazy and unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings did not notice that at the end of his team, a soldier suddenly fell softly and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, in a cave in the wilderness, Richard dropped the soldier and began a detailed examination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real world, all the secrets of this warrior are revealed. In his body, Richard saw many familiar structures. This structure is much different from the common body structure of human beings, but the mother nest is developed based on the optimal functional structure in human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it to be a nesting warrior, and the level is higher than my mother's nest." He didn't know where Heitings got a nest, but if he had to be completely hostile to Heitings, then the first thing Richard did was to kill his mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is not the same as the reaper, and the reaper is even more than a thousand times the speed of the combat unit. In the case that the reaper has enough excess essence, if Richard is alone in attacking the mother ship, he may face thousands of fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basal defense is more dependent on itself and the surrounding environment, its ability to build is limited, to focus on the manufacture of high-level units. Moreover, manufacturing capabilities and ontological power are in conflict. Therefore, in the eyes of the super strong, the defense ability of the mother nest body is much lower than that of the harvester mother ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to check the warrior, and the traces of the soul being filled were of course not to him, and then Richard found that the body of the warrior was actually a human powerhouse. soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this soul, there are layers of spells bound, forcing them to obey specific commands, and are locked in this body. This is a very clever soul technique, but it allows Richard to see the flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the true hen's nest does not require a soul at all, and their body is implanted with a specific password, which only obeys certain specific commands. Therefore, the soldiers of the Brood have no soul, and they do not need the soul at all, even the elite units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a special unit like the Twilight Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infusing the Brood Warrior with the treated soul, and then manipulating it, is completely an act of all in the eyes of Richard. Combined with Heitings’s clumsy and primitive command of the entire army, it’s strange that Richard does not know that his army has problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard himself is the master of the control of the Brood Warrior, he is completely commanded from the consciousness to the specific Brood Warrior, manipulating them to complete the predetermined tactical concept, There is no need to pass on orders, military numbers and flags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Heitings is still relying on these rather primitive means to command, and Richard has not found any arms of the non-brothers in his army, which means that Heitings does not have the command of these mothers at the soul level. The ability of the nest warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has roughly inferred the truth. Heitings must have encountered a nest in some cases, or just a nest that the mother nest used to store troops. He then used the soul-like magic to seal the collected souls of the human strong in the body of the Brood Warrior, thus gaining the ability to control these hens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the control of the Brood Warrior is very limited, and the inability to accept the soul command is to remove their biggest advantage. However, Lee forgives that Heitings does not have the ability to control a mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only advantage of Heitings is the quantity. The number of troops in this group is too great, and it is not a problem to flatten several military missions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard has seen the problem of Heitings. His army is a single unit, the command is rigid, and the special skills of many ancestral warriors are not available at all. The actual combat power is greatly reduced, far from being as powerful as it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not because of the war with the Reaper, if Richard brings the same number of night elves, as well as the Frost Warrior, the Beastmaster and the Insect Warrior, and many other arms. The mixed army, although the average level is lower than the entire two levels, can defeat the obvious short-armed army of Heatings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechao silently estimated that with the current strength of Heitings, the top three Dax Sodas regiments would be cold. However, the Dax Sodas must not look at him and remove the fortress of the party, one by one, and will definitely show the cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the quantitative advantage has always been on the side of the Dakso Das. Richard suddenly thought of the devil fish he had seen in the field on the ground in the field, and he could not help but sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, Heitings has a great influence on the Holy Alliance, and Richard is not interested in the problematic parent nest behind him. Therefore, Richard did not do anything to him, but he returned to the place where Xu Sunrise rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, I encountered a relatively unlucky Dakosodas legendary black mage. Richard took a knife and cut his head and then skillfully harvested it. material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
