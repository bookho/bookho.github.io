			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl has an hour of rest, but Richard does not. As soon as he returned to his room, he began to prepare for the preparation of all necessary potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Richard’s magic pen was once again on the knee of the splash. Time passed away in silence, and it was all night after the construction was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the girl’s legs are covered by complex magic lines from the ankle to the knees, revealing a mysterious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out the exhausted body and looked at the finished structure. He smiled and said, "Try it, don't use it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl had some doubts, but she bounced off the bed and floated on the floor, then accelerated with lightning and rushed straight to a chair. If it is not popular, she should slow down and turn around the chair. However, this time, as her mind moved, the structure on her legs shone slightly, and the girl naturally stepped on the chair, and then quickly walked over, the movements were smooth and natural, and there was no slowdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the room is so big that it doesn’t slow down, and the water splashes into the wall. She rose up lightly and went straight to the wall. Then she rushed to the wall and stepped up on the ceiling for a few steps before she fell in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl finally showed her surprise and looked down at her legs. The texture of the magical pattern that spreads over the calves and the stars is slowly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly moved again, this time in a random circumstance in the room, and constantly rubbed past Richard. If a girl is a ghost, the complicated shape does not slow down her speed, it is only slightly inferior to the use of popular ability. When standing in front of Richard again, the surprise in the eyes of the water has become a deep surprise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a wild call, allowing you to move freely in most complex terrains, with only a small movement speed reduction. And it can boost your acceleration. In a type of sandstone or swamp, the speed of movement can be completely lost, and the speed of your uphill will increase in the future," Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a girl who is good at darkness and jungle action, and who is accustomed to killing, this improvement in mobility is the most straightforward improvement in combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you..." The girl was expressionless, but she finally squeezed out two words from her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said, "You and I don't have to say thank you. We are all one. In addition, the wilderness call is just that I want to do it for you." The first one, and the next four! In the past two months, it is estimated that you have to endure it. Well, I will go to rest first, and I have not slept for a few days."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four configurations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s body is slightly shocked, and the drooping eyelids are also fluttering. Seeing that Richard was leaving the room, she bit her teeth and said in a very sturdy and stiff tone: "That... your wounds... still hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard’s laughter glimpsed, then glared at the girl. The girl showed some uneasiness, and she understood that she seemed to say something wrong again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This matter... I won't mention it later!" Richard snorted heavily and slammed the door out of the house. Only at the time of the action, it can be seen that his walking posture is somewhat unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is always unsatisfactory, and the time of rest is not clear, the trouble is naturally from the quicksand, she is also the only person who can enter and exit the room at random. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your face is not very good." Liu Sha seriously looked at Richard who was preparing to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's tired." Richard replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not like! Are you injured?" The sand is obviously not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Richard's voice increased by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where the injury is, show me." Flowing sand insisted, and reached out to solve Richard's clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really no injuries!" Richard was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to lie to the eternal and the dragon of the time, the gods, after a dozen or more levels, let's talk about it!" Flowing sand is not welcome, in Richard's injury On the matter, she is definitely not going to give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sand immediately thought of a problem. Richard did not go out these days, how was he injured? It is clear that he has been painting the waterworks all the time! As soon as I thought about the process of drawing the structure, Liu Sha said without thinking: "How did you hurt? Didn't explain her when she was painting, and she was countered by her instinct..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, the sand is stunned. Her inadvertent sentence has almost reached the truth of the facts, and she immediately thought of what the habitual counterattack of the water flower was, so she immediately slammed her mouth and looked at Richard's gaze, and it became a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's face was blue, and he picked up the sand, opened the door, threw her out, and then slammed it off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, hey, and a soft, even knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helpless and opened the door and said, "What are you doing again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is really a running sand outside the door, she laughs like a wild flower, saying: "I will treat minor injuries, it is a treatment of minor injuries!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Li looked at the sky with both eyes, biting his teeth, plunging her into the room and closing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full ten hours of rest, Richard strode to the splash room and continued to draw a new structure. The effect of Richard's rest was obviously very good. At least from his walking posture, the girl could not see anything wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is close to the two days of sleeplessness, and there is a pale silver magic pattern on the chest and abdomen of the splash. This is the special decoration of Richard: silver stencil. It covers an important part of the body and can enhance the body's direct defense, which is equivalent to wearing a refined leather armor. In addition, it can also enhance magic resistance, especially the resistance to natural magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Splash does not like armor, and her combat stunts can only be fully utilized when they are light. However, the defensive power can not be ignored, and many of the advanced magic has the ability to track the lock, or the area killing effect, the magic resistance is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
