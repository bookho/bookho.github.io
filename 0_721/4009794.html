			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, a small number of teams were expanded from Jumu Town. Go to the port of Mokfand in the east. When I saw the splashes and Gangde brought back by Richard, the flowing sand also showed a faint surprise. However, there was a slight twist in the departure. No horse in the team could bear the weight of Gangde. In addition, all the horses were not willing to get close to the water, let alone let her ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard gave his armored horse to Gangde, and Lina found a most docile horse and kept throwing a few Animals appease, this allowed the water to ride up and set off smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the idea of ​​Gangde and Shuihua, I am willing to go to Mokfande with two legs all the way, which is faster for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a three-day long journey, this small team finally arrived at Port Mokfand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mock van der is located on the east coast of the mainland, close to the northeastern territory of the Holy Alliance, and is a natural haven. However, compared with the star-studded port of more than 100 kilometers in the south, it is far from the distance to the floating world, and the northern part of the port is the mountain range. There are not many special products in the surrounding area, so it has not really prospered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mock van der is half-free in nature, and local lord Mofan nominally owes allegiance to the Allied Emperor, but only pays a nominal tax every year. In this port city with a population of just over 10,000, Mofan is the supreme monarch. Mokfande also has his own unique advantage, that is, the slave trade of the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its strategic location, you can buy almost any race you want in Mokfand, from the Grey Dwarf to Naga. In addition, due to the nature of the semi-free collar, you can also buy all the races that the Holy Alliance prohibits from buying and selling, such as the human aristocracy who lost the title within three generations, and certain elves and winged tribes who have been affiliated with the Holy Alliance. Wait. Even if the bid is high enough, it is possible to get a few goods with royal blood. However, this kind of goods can't be seen at all. The people who buy will have enough wealth and status, and the purpose is nothing more than two kinds: collection use, or as an experimental product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every inch of Mokfande’s land, it is full of blood and gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping into the territory of Mokfand, Richard was stopped by a team of patrolling light cavalry. His team consists of a knight, a light cavalry, and a magician. It is not an ordinary adventurer squad, but a standard army, enough to alert any uncoordinated forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also observed the other side, the six-person patrol light cavalry are equipped with well-made locks, all weapons have also reached 'excellent 'The standard means that they are at least 20% more powerful than ordinary weapons. The cavalry's own rank is above five. Only from this squad patrol cavalry can you see the strength of Mokfande. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a driver who came to the cavalry to deal with the sand. After giving the token of the Eternal Dragon Temple to the patrol captain, the attitude of the light cavalry immediately respected many . The captain assigned two people to report back, and they led the remaining cavalry to escort them to the port city of Mokfand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting with Mofan was very smooth. This is a middle-aged man with a businessman-like temperament, who received Richard and quicksand with just the right enthusiasm, and soon They sent people to take them to 'pick' the slaves, and they didn't drag the water at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final destination of the trip was a small slave camp on the outskirts of Mokfand. The number of guards here is three times more than the normal slave camp, which shows the importance attached to the slaves in custody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked into the door, you couldn’t hear the usual voice of swearing and laboring. Looking around, except for the guards, there was no other person walking around the big venue. The slave camp looked empty, and it was obvious that ordinary slaves had been temporarily removed. This camp has become a secret place dedicated to this transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the assistants from the Morvan, Richard followed him into a shack in the northern part of the slave camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, a pungent smell rushed over. After walking through the death camp, Richard had immunity to similar tastes, no Walked behind the assistant, not even a frowning expression. This was a surprise to the other party's snacks, and a new look at the aristocratic little master wearing a magician's robes. What is even more surprising is that the sands have come in this time. She is always the face with no expression, and seems to have no idea of ​​the harsh environment of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shack is separated into a prison-like house by a large iron fence. This is where the slaves usually live, and now more than half of the prisons are empty, and only seven people are closed. To be precise, they are seven groups of slaves, because the largest one of them has two ogres. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Richard’s attention was first drawn to the past by two ogres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre is a common intellectual race in the mainland of Noland, and has a blood relationship with humans and orcs, but this does not prevent them from including humans and orcs. On the recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre is tall and strong, and has the power to match the size. An adult ogre can naturally suppress the ten-level human warrior. And they are tall, strong, and not stupid. In fact, many people think that the ogre is not inferior to the human or elf's intelligent creatures, which can be seen from the proportion of mages and priests in the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ogres reach a certain limit, there is a possibility of variability, and the highest probability of variability is the growth of the second head. The double-headed ogres have far more combat power than ordinary ogres, both in magic and in battle. To knock down a double-headed ogre, you often need an elite human adventure team that is well equipped, professionally matched, and well-trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres that Richard saw were not fully adult, slightly smaller than the normal ogre, but the feeling for Richard was strange. They are very clean and clean, a bit less like an ogre, and they are relaxed at the sitting position in the prison. They are so irritating and nervous as ordinary ogres. When Richard observed them, they were actually observing Richard. From this point of view, obviously they are much smarter than ordinary ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be two ogres?" Richard asked the assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mofan’s assistant said: “This is a group of adventurers who discovered deep in the northern mountains when they lived with an old Druid. It is said that the old Druid was raised from a young age. The old Druid taught them language, words and even magic, and also brought them many human habits."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?" In fact, Richard has roughly guessed the next story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then..." the assistant shrugged and said, "Then the team of adventurers discovered their value, they killed Druid and put them I grabbed it and sold it to us. Speaking of it, the first time Mofan was buying ogres at the price of 10,000 gold coins! Of course they are smart, much smarter than ordinary ogres, but also It means a lot more dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
