			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight is silent for a while, the light in both eyes keeps flashing, after a while Say: "It’s because of the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color used is a complex god, belonging to the same language as the mother nest, but with Noland The system of knowing the gods is different. Because of the mother's nest, Richard can understand what it is saying, not just relying on the exchange of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another small detail that Richard feels strange. The humanoid combat unit is not human after all. In fact, the language is very unnecessary, especially only Richard and When two people are in the twilight, they can communicate with each other. But the twilight seems to be more like a human being. Richard talks to it every time. Whether it is talking or conscious, the twilight is usually answered in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the answer to Twilight this time obviously does not satisfy Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More specific."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in battle, killed by me Enemy, the soul will be extracted by me and transformed into the power for me to use, so that my strength can be improved." The twilight finally expressed clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where does this ability come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was created Yes, it should be the ability to extract from the original template."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and the problem has been clarified. It seems that Twilight has inherited a lot of Sinclair's ability to survive, and even in some respects has been enhanced. After all, it is a special unit that consumes three whole gods. Richard now has no specific concept of how much the three divinities are, but it must not be worse than the ancestor of a large tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the evolutionary trend of the twilight, it should be to gradually abandon the enhanced defense, and to increase speed and lethality. After considering it for a while, Richard was not prepared to interfere with its natural evolutionary direction. Instead, he decided to tailor a light armor for it. The defense is equally important on the battlefield. The heavy attack and light defense only play when the small team fights. effect. Basic defense can sometimes save lives, as can be seen from the end of Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the twilight, Richard thought of the splash. This wild and cold girl also ignores the defense, and even the leather armor is not willing to wear it. It only provides a limited defense force in the construction, and it does not protect the real strong. Therefore, Richard also decided to order a set of leather armor for the girl, and can no longer let her fight according to her own character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than two hundred stakes erected, the corps of the thieves hanging on the stakes quickly became a hot topic on the baron of Fontaine. A few days later, the news was like a twin wings, flying over to various places in the Sequoia Kingdom. So Richard and his land of a barren land once again entered the vision of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countless afternoon tea parties, feasts and tables, Richard has become a topic of discussion. Because the name of Archimonde has never been heard, and his pedigree in the official records has been broken down in the aristocratic coat of arms for four generations, so Richard was unfortunately assigned to the nouveau riche. In the ranks, it was labeled as 'cold'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nobles did not think that Richard was cruel, and everything he did was one of the means by which the great aristocrats dealt with the bandits. In history, even aristocrats shredded the whole group of bandits and then used them as feed to feed dogs. Therefore, what Richard has done is only enough to meet the cold standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
