			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of Richard and the nest has entered the world of the storm, surrounded by devastating spiritual eddies. Richard felt like he was wrapped in a small bubble and danced around in the storm. Bubbles are very fragile. Once they are subjected to excessive force, they may rupture. At that time, the spiritual eddies generated by the will of the forest will directly impact the souls of Richard and the nest. Once the soul is destroyed, it is naturally dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no room for regret at this moment, can only fully observe the surrounding vortex, avoid the violent vortex, and then jump from a gentle vortex to another A gentle vortex. This is the spiritual world. In fact, Richard's true talent perceives the spiritual storm that the forest will initiate, and then restores it in Richard's soul. Richard sees it. At this moment, the wisdom talent is already working at full strength, trying to find a safe route from the storm. But the so-called security is only relative. The barrier that protects the soul is faltering under the impact of the storm. Richard feels that his spiritual strength is pouring out like a flood, so it can't be supported for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, only persist in the end. Richard and the nest's soul are just a small point, and the forest will want to destroy him, only to maintain the intensity of the storm. Although the forest will have the entire forest sea do not know how many years of accumulation, but the spiritual storm of this scale may not support too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a crack in the mental barrier, which was repaired by Richard. Every time it was repeated, there was pain in tearing the soul. Richard had already got used to the pain, and the pain of time and time did not make him fall, but gradually stirred up the fury in his heart. The blood of Archimonde begins to boil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm seems to never end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent vortex suddenly rushed from the top, Richard could not completely escape, the soul barrier was cut open by the violent knife-like spirit vortex The rip, several forests will immediately penetrate into the barrier rip. At this moment, Richard's Akmon blood suddenly boiled, bringing him endless anger. Richard's entire soul has turned into a dark red, slamming into the forest will infiltrate, and hit it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real name of Dissmason emerged from the blood, and there was a faint dark red glow on Richard’s fist. The forest will be on! That layer of dark fire instantly spread along the infiltrated forest will, and the forest will be reddened out of the barrier, the scope of the dip is dozens of times larger than Richard's own soul. In the twinkling of an eye, the red-stained forest will burn fiercely and annihilate at a speed visible to the naked eye, and a large vacuum suddenly appears outside the soul barrier. Richard also paid a price, his fists became dim and thin, leaving only one-third, and the disappearing part had been destroyed by the forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly there was a shouting whistling in the storm, like the sound of the wind, and the arrogance of a behemoth. However, Richard heard the pain. The destroyed forest will be a small water in the sea compared to the whole, but this is the world of the soul. Any damage will cause severe pain in the whole soul. This is equivalent to the knowledge of the forest will, and of course he is not good. From the proportion of the soul energy, Richard's loss is far greater than the forest will. The forest will be too big, and the loss is almost negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard also knows that this is a hopeless war, and most of the time he can't support the end of the mental storm. However, the bloody nature of Archimonde has been thoroughly stimulated, and Richard decided that even if he is going to die, he will bite a few more meat! He mobilized the remaining mental power to fill the soul and soul barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest sound was attacked and became more wild and violent, and Richard’s wisdom talent has been unable to keep up with the speed of the storm. It didn't take long for the barrier to be broken. This time, Richard’s attack has become more violent, and the dark red that spreads out has a wider coverage, and the raging flames reflect a large space. The forest will growled in agony, in order to set off a bigger storm to respond to the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneered, the ability of the forest to endure pain is lower than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barrier was torn for the second time, the third time... Richard had already suffered from numbness, but still had to maintain the full power of wisdom and real talent, this At this moment, it is already insisting on a will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape once again escaped from the spiritual vortex, once again destroyed the will to penetrate the forest, and when Richard once again made up for the barrier, it suddenly turned black! He woke up in an instant and saw a marked trace of weakness on the soul barrier. That is the sign that his mental power has dried up and is not enough to repair the barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is already on the verge of extinction? Richard suddenly looked up and screamed with the restless spiritual power: "Want to kill me? Come!! Come and try!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is like The roaring roar of the beasts echoed throughout the mental storm. The blood of Archimonde is completely boiling, and a strand of magma spurts out. The wells of the stars are also pulsating, spraying a star power and transforming it into the power of soul and spirit. Only now, the resilience of the Stars Well is not enough to support Richard's consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul barrier was once again hit, but fortunately it was not broken down. It was already cracked and it would be the end if it was hit. At this time, Richard calmed down and mobilized all the power, waiting quietly for the moment when the barrier broke. Once the barrier is broken, he is ready to use his own soul as a fuel to thoroughly inspire the power to destroy the real name. The storm of destruction that was formed at that time may wipe out the spiritual storm formed by the forest will! To this extent, the forest will not recover for hundreds of years. Richard has decided that even if it is dead, give it a sigh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, suddenly a cool stream of water flows into the heart of Richard, that is pure spiritual power! All of a sudden added a little to Richard, at least the barrier crack can make up for most of it. Richard was shocked and happy, looking around and seeing the nucleus of the mother's nest did not know when it was separated from his own soul and turned into a palm-sized worm, the form when the mother's nest just appeared. At this time, the larvae are catching a group of light green energy and eating it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken aback, because the mother's nest corpus is swallowing the spiritual power of the forest will! The mother's nest larvae eat very quickly, and swallowed the spirit energy of this group in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another spiritual vortex blew in Richard, this time a large number of forest will penetrate and be continuously killed by Richard. This time, Richard paid the price of an arm of the soul, and he saw that the mother's nest larvae also plunged into the forest will, tearing off a large forest will with sharp limb blades and mouthparts, and then continued to swallow. . As the mother nest larvae continue to swallow the will of the forest, there will always be a pure spiritual power feedback to Richard to make up for the consumption of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest will can be devastated by Richard, and the hunger of the mother's nest is not without cost. After eating the will of the forest, it immediately screamed and swelled, but no matter how convulsive it struggled, the transformed spiritual power was given to Richard at a constant frequency. With this important addition, Richard finally managed to support it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small ball of light is floating in the storm, never falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Hai suddenly vibrates, the forest will send out only the Richard and the mother nest larvae can not hear the roar, and finally retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard, who was sitting on the ground, slowly opened his eyes, but immediately there were two blood lines running down the corner of his eye. He tried to move his body and immediately made a squeaking sound everywhere, breaking at least a dozen bones. Rao is amazed by the will of Richard, and he can't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
