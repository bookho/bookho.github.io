			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the battlefield is well known, except for the early years of following the legendary wizard The few planes, at least half of the big magisters are afraid to go, they are not good at fighting in the direction of research, especially in the field of non-formal battles, there is no legal service division. The place where the forward guards are divided, one can not even die under the claws of a mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard has lived in the field for more than a year, not everyone knows this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, this, can you think about it again, you are not a big magician after all, and the future is huge, after the time is ripe, go It’s more appropriate.” A white-haired big magister is leaning against his oldest and admonishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "It doesn't matter, I am familiar with the land at dusk. I have lived there for a year." When he spoke, he subconsciously moved. With his slender fingers, he pointed to the knife and made an assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Richard carried a simple bag as usual, and set foot on the dusk again. Before returning, he did not go to say goodbye to the drifting sand, still the same. He was afraid of seeing the sand and it was difficult to return to the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I was faced with the fact that Dax Sodas was struggling, and the situation was different when Richard agreed to sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the familiar platform, overlooking the traumatic land below, Richard’s heartlessness, regardless of the reasons, this is still him For the first time, he participated in the Holy Alliance and even as a member of the Norland Human Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it is clear that the front is extremely dangerous, and it is very likely that there will be no return. Richard is also fearless, but he is proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of belonging is a wonderful thing. Richard always thought that this was a very inexplicable feeling and would never happen to himself, but now However, he actually felt its existence in reality, and the hell is that it is quite powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard laughed and laughed at himself, taking out the short knife of the barbaric slaughter and leaping from the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fall gradually accelerated, Richard suddenly reached out and grabbed a rock on the edge of the cliff, and the whole man suddenly hovered, under his feet, a deep black sickle shape The forelimbs broke out and passed silently. The blade was almost swept against the soles of Richard. If Richard was still falling at the original speed, most of them would be split into two, but now it is Richard. The short knife in the hand strikes with lightning, and the blade passes over, and the fore leg of the blade is removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only released the five fingers and continued to fall, while the left hand pulled the broken limbs in the cliff and pulled it, and the ambush Daxeda The knife guards pulled the whole out of the cliff and threw it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blade Guard has a pair of arm-like arms, and a pair of arms, three fingers at the end, and two pairs of transparent short wings inside the carapace behind them. Flying short distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the two people are nearly 1,000 kilometers away from the ground, and they are falling rapidly at the same speed. The blade guards stare at Richard, but they dare not Short-wing, because Richard's left-handed five-finger fingertips are always burning with flames, it is almost certain that once the short-wings unfold, they will immediately become the target of the human wizard's fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fell like a meteor to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that there are still tens of meters from the ground, Richard suddenly showed a meaningful smile to the blade guard, then the left hand flames converge, and the backhand blessed himself. Feathering, the fall is slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade guards screamed and reacted abruptly, but it was already late, falling into the ground during the anger, and he opened the short wing urgently, but I haven't had time to pat a few times, just like a meteorite hitting the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kilometer straight, this huge impact is that the powerful Dakso Das people can’t stand it. When Richard slowly falls, this knife guard Has not moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's so easy." Richard shrugged and whistled at the body of the Blade Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the extremist battlefield, Richard’s character has completely changed. With this kind of cynicism, Richard can put tremendous pressure on life and death. After he has been eliminated, he is still young and has a great future. It is not so easy to face life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under His Majesty, he opened a box with space and weight-reduction functions and began to harvest the materials of the Blade Guardian. The Blade Guardian is a very rare race. It usually appears around the sun and the most. Valuable is the two pairs of short wings behind them. When the short wings are unfolded, they will have the effect of reducing gravity, and the second is the pair of invincible blades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hurry to harvest the material. When he threw a blade into the box, he suddenly reached out and held the fate on the ground. Gemini, a flash of lightning appeared in the air, and in a flash hit a mouse behind him who wanted to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-level instant lightning is not very harmful to the mouse, but the timing of hitting the mouse is just right, it has begun to slam, this The lightning just happened to make it paralyzed. It could only scream and let the body fly forward with inertia, watching the tip of his nose getting closer and closer to Richard's blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, the savage slaughtering knife almost cut into the head of the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the corpse of the mouse that fell on his feet, Richard shook his head and sighed: "Oh, let me waste a spell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard has collected all the materials and black crystals and continues to rush to the sun. He is not going fast, occasionally on the road. It will leave some breath, in order to attract the Dax Sodas to hunt themselves, some breath is a clue, and some are traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the twilight is covered with wounds, and there will always be a low roar. A huge bear-like warlord is running all the way, swinging his head from side to side. A few screams, its smoldering water drops on the ground, it will emit green smoke, and the snoring will spread far away, up to several tens of kilometers. This bear’s first warlord is warning that the kind should not be close, the prey in front is his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a deep red stone forest, the bear chief overseer finally found his prey, Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two strong faces once they meet, do not need any opening remarks, directly kill, that is, some people want to put some rumors, but also because the language is unreasonable As expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an earth-shattering battle. The giant force of the bear’s first warlord is even more terrible than the ogre. The heavy hammer in the hand is a giant pit. The oscillating aftermath also has a strong damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's body shape is flickering and slowing. Under the double blessing of magic aids and magical armed forces, his speed of retreat far exceeds that of the Xiongshou Warlord, and he often avoids the heavy blow of the bear chief overseer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides fought for a moment and gradually fell into a stalemate. It is difficult for the bear’s first overseer to hit Richard, and it is difficult for Richard’s attack to attack it to cause real damage. Under the thick hair of the bear's first warlord, there is a small scale, and the defense is even more than the epic armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly burst into a bloody glow on his arms, a rushing thorn, and the superposition of four lives made the bear’s first superintendent suddenly feel a huge threat. A mad man, the giant palm smashed to the elf knife in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard suddenly gave a gravitational technique, not to the bear’s first overseer, but to release himself on his own body. His rushing momentum was suddenly slow, just right. Let the bear's first overseer's slams take an empty shot, and then the arms of the bears converge, and the elf's long knife slashes and picks up. In the bloody splash, a complete ** flies into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sergeant of the bears made a roar of earth-shattering, and instantly became so mad, madly slammed Richard, and Richard converges on life. Calmly circled around it, and finally the local dripping liquid began to merge into a small otter, and the bear's first overlord who had lost too much blood collapsed slantingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's long knife stabbed into the head of the bear's first overseer, ending his life, then he took out a long knife and looked to the side, at that In the direction, two men and one woman appeared on the edge of the battlefield. They looked at Richard with vigilance and looked at the body of the bear's first superintendent who was planted on the ground. They were cautious and hesitant, and did not immediately rush to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to them and hooked his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a provocative action that any intelligent race can understand. The strong insult means that the two demons are screaming low and constantly revealing to Richard. Tooth decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are only slowly approaching, and the goal is to point directly to the body of the bear’s first superintendent at the foot of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated for a moment, he realized something, then he swayed to the cut, put it in the box, and then slowly left . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
