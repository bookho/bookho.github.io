			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the hall of Su Hailun’s main hall, which contains a variety of natural planes. Environment, lava, swamp, forest, snowfield, desert... Each terrain is a world of its own. This magnificent temple is called “Mirror of Vientiane”. Everyone who enters the hall will see different scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the experience of the legendary Master’s travels is recorded here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time you come, you will enter the "Emerald Dream" without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a place full of mystery and beauty. The whole world seems to be composed of luxurious and psychedelic light and shadow, even if there are green trees, lawns and flowing water, it is like The scenery in the paintings does not mean that they are not exquisite and beautiful, but in a whole dreamlike environment, these beautiful natural scenes are like a painting hanging on a wall, which can go in, but cannot be integrated with the surroundings. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky here is the bottomless black. Whenever you look up, you will see deep stars, and the light will drift freely. They are not only In the temple, you can also penetrate the dome and the wall, as if there is no entity at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in such a place, there is always a feeling of walking in the endless void, the green lake water that Su Hailun often rests in the distance, looks so unreal . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vain can't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t remember how long he hasn’t been here before, the memories of his childhood seem so long, and even become a bit fuzzy, between the planes The real master is time. When a person walks through the planes of different time flow rates for a long time, he will slowly forget the time that has passed by him, and the memory will gradually become blurred and finally chaos. He has already Putting the memory in this hall in the most precious position, but still inevitably being followed by a huge number of new experiences dilute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost is the topic that all the powerful people in the depths of the exploration are ignoring. The chaos of memory is just the beginning of loss. The real loss will even make the strong. They can't think of who they are, they will stand in the void, facing the innumerable grotesque planes, but they can no longer find the origin of their departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ignorant, I can't remember how long I have been exploring. At that time, with the enthusiasm and hope, I walked out of the dark blue and stepped into the emptiness of the endless plane. At this moment, I was stranger in memory as another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and sorted out the confused thoughts and memories. The wound on his face was still stinging. This sting helped him and let him Knowing that it is still in Noland, still in dark blue, is not immersed in the memories of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to move forward, the other end of the "Emerald Dream" in memory is the exit of the "Mirror of Vientiane", and then go not far, go through The long corridor will lead to the private space of Su Helun, where she has always been a resting place and an area that does not allow anyone to step in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vain was once very popular with her, but the closest one was only to see the entrance to the promenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, as long as you move forward, you can break through the limits of the past, and the imaginary feet will be lifted, but they will not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action is a stiff one second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second, for a strong person like vain, perhaps a thousand ideas flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet are still falling, this step is surprisingly heavy, once again shaking the entire hall, it also shows illusory unparalleled the power of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is very clear in my heart that this is not a demonstration, but a force that cannot control oneself, because his heart is deep in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since very young days, he has been very scared of Su Helun, that is a natural awe of her enormous power, and today she is imagining herself. He has the power he never dreamed of, but his heart still has the fear of Su Hailun. It is the fear that reason can't suppress. If it is not Su Hailun who suddenly falls into a deep sleep, he definitely has no guts to do these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very chance, ignorant knows a little about the Su Hailun race and understands what sleep means for the existence of her race. Therefore, he only came back after learning that Su Hailun had fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that if I miss this opportunity, I will never have a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked step by step, the exit was just a stone's throw away, wherever it was, the tree was dissolved, the grass was dissolved, and the elves were dissolved one by one. Even the clear lake water has become a viscous wax liquid. Except for the material that constitutes the main body of the hall, everything in the "Emerald Dream", whether it is human or material, is finally turned into a wax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He approached the promenade, walked into the promenade, and walked out of the promenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, I saw Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage still lay on the platform, fell asleep, and did not react to everything that happened around him, but the golden hair on his forehead stood up. Swaying alertly, it seems to be distinguishing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion stopped at the first sight of her, and his face was full of complexity and struggle, I don’t know if I should go any further. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." The vain voice rang in the hall, and Su Helun did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, once this race is asleep, it is a sign of great trauma..." vainly, as if verifying something, his eyes The light in the light is gradually lit, which is an extremely dangerous signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, they don't know, your true value is not in magic or ability, but in yourself..." imaginary finally continues to step forward That piece of blue is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the main hall, the big magical guides are like the ants on the hot pot, and they are anxious to turn around, but they are helpless. They are used to obeying Su Hailun. Commands, such as this strict order, are not going to violate the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, I don’t know who suddenly called: “Richard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The big magician instinctively looked at the place where Richard had fallen. Their memory was not as good as that of the magical image. But the place where the original Li was lying is now empty, and there is only one blood on the ground. Stretching forward, the eyes of the big magisters looked forward along the blood, but I saw that Richard did not know when he had climbed more than ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li was still on the ground, and he didn't even have the strength to raise his head. He didn't know what supported him. He moved to the direction of Su Hailun's main hall. He clung to the elf's long knife. This knife once fell off the ground. But now I am back in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard is not grasping the handle, but the blade. He is so tightly held that he seems to be afraid of losing his weapon, so that every one When you crawl, you can hear the sound of the blade and the hand bones rubbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flows from the wound in the hand of Richard, and also from other wounds, flowing over the ground, as Richard continues to crawl forward, dragging on the ground A long trace of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magisters were shocked for a moment, and no one thought of going to treat Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Theodore took a step forward and waved a powerful cure on Richard, but this should be able to greatly alleviate the damage of Richard's injury. On Richard, there was no effect. Theodore himself snorted and slammed like something, and involuntarily stepped back two steps, and immediately shed a stream of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the power of vain." Immediately there was a big magician exclaiming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodore blessed himself with two defensive techniques, and moved forward one step further, trying to continue to treat Richard, his hand suddenly being another The big magister held it down, and when Theodore looked at it, the great magister said, "What will happen if you save him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Theodore stunned and looked at Richard, who was still struggling to climb forward. If he was thoughtful, if Richard’s injury was light, he would immediately climb up and rush into the hall of Su Hailun, then he would not die. It is better to keep the status quo first, and then save him when things have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things going on...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is not only passed from the heart of a big magister And then they are all ashamed, whether it is the awe of Su Hailun or the fear of vain, they are all fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a sudden and heavy footstep sounded on the stairs, and the gray dwarf rushed up with a murderous gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
