			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, go in and see." Richard put the list down and took the lead Walking inside the prison, the two costume knights struggled to open the heavy door of the prison. I saw that it was dark and nothing could be seen, but there was no rancid smell in the prison. Richard threw an illumination behind the door. The ball of light, this is so great that it sees the internal structure of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 30-meter-high hall with a separate compartment on each side of the wall, but most of the cells They are all empty. There are many instruments of torture scattered at the end of the hall. The area is covered with blood stains on the beach. In the corner of the main hall, there is a separate barrier separating a separate space, which is sitting in a naked body. The man, the unkempt hair and the beard almost completely obscured his face. In the space, there were several swords in the ground, and I didn’t know what to do. The most striking thing was the metal with different colors. The line hangs from the top of the space and is nailed into his head. The other end of the wire is connected to a console-like alchemy instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, this man has a familiar feeling to Richard. He has long legs and long legs. Although his body is full of muscles, his body is still more common. Human men need to be longer, more powerful and agile, just like a cheetah. There is no information about the man's origins. It is only from the list that his name is Mario Greenson. Unfortunately, the prison guards are extremely loyal. All of them fought to death, so that Richard did not have any chance to ask something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the console and looked at it. There are four handles and two buttons on this console. It’s unclear what it is, Li When he looked at it, he pushed a handle directly up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man behind the transparent barrier suddenly shocked his body and stood up. His eyes were strangely golden, but he was so ignorant that his eyes had no focal length. At this time, a wire on his head suddenly jumped out of a few sparks, and his face suddenly showed various expressions, sadness, anger, and extreme madness. He took a hand and jumped on a sword on the ground. Into his hand, immediately sprinkled a glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man stabbed a few swords, the attack was fierce and fierce, but there was a kind of elegance in the bones, and Richard’s heart suddenly jumped, almost The word "fair swordsman" shouted out. The man's swordsmanship is not the same as the swordsmanship that Richard knows, but it is a high-level elf style. His body movements can also see the brand of the high elves. And it is a generation of strong elves, but it is so dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s heart sighed and sighed, and he pulled it back in place and pressed a button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this button is pressed, another metal wire flashes luster, the elf strong still has no eyes, but the expression on the face changes. This time, I was shocked and angry. I left my sword in my hand and asked for a long and short machete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scimitar started, his whole person's momentum changed again, and there was a deep and stagnation feeling. The elf strong suddenly burst into a big bang, and the double knife was like a wind. It was like a sudden rain that was cut out in all directions. It was like being surrounded by thousands of horses. Later, he suddenly became slow and slow, his knife was unpredictable, and he always hangs on the blade. Moving brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes slightly, and the followers around him gradually became tense, even Senma subconsciously grasped the hilt, the elf strong It seems that he is hacking in Huche, but if he is standing opposite him, he will know the horror of his knife. The knife is simply incredible. Every time he comes from a place he can’t think of, in a blink of an eye, the followers are very responsive. Such as Gangde is already a cold sweat, he is brave and powerful, and the martial arts of the Elf is just his nemesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde just took a few moves in the imagination and the elf strongman, and suddenly found that if it is really hands-on, he has been cut into several pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's strong eyes still have no look in his eyes. He is more like a phantom and can't extricate himself. He only fights with the enemy in his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha also sees the concentration of high-level elves’ skills, which have always been recognized as top-level standards, but because they are too complicated and extremely demanding on the talents, so It’s not widely spread, but the elf warfare is very suitable for Richard. He is not a real warrior after all. The martial arts converted from the magical armed forces are limited, so this kind of skill-oriented blood, emphasizing the one-shot killing spirit For use together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the temperament of the Elf is only 12 or 3, but watching his superb skills and boundless momentum, but it is impossible to have such a point. Power may have lost strength in long-term detention. It is also possible that the Shulans destroyed his vindictiveness by some means, leaving him with such a small margin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf strongman seems to have entered a state of despair in the illusion, and the knife is getting slower and slower. It seems to be scarred, but his own power is clearly not consumed. The signs, it can be seen, the illusion of trapping him is extremely powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were some unstable elves who stood still in the station and suddenly stood up straight, and the momentum rose to the sky. He was screaming at both eyes, although he still had no eyes and no focus, but everyone including Richard. It seems that he feels that his cold eyes are passing by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, this dying elf strongman is like a waking dragon, which really shows his majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the prison, and then the whole black prison became brighter, because there was a round of amber light on the top of the Elf wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Li has suddenly changed, but he has not waited for his exclamation. This elf is already holding a double knife and instantly circling more than ten in place. Circles, a round of amber brilliance like a wave of water, surrounded by every inch of space surrounded by a transparent barrier, those transparent barriers are extremely strong, have been cut a lot by the elf strong, but none Leaving a trace, it seems that it will not be hurt by the temperament of the 12th level, but now it is covered with slender nicks, and the individual nicks are as deep as one centimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to engrave a centimeter of deep marks on the transparent barrier means that you can divide the Nolande reloading knight’s fine-level body plate into two. This is not a knife, but a myriad of knives, each with an approximate power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ring of Destiny." Richard finally couldn’t control himself and shouted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original, the secret sword of the Elf is the second sword of the month of the amber, the ring of destiny, it should be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning the full set of Elf secret swords from Gordon on the same day, Richard gradually became confused, because in addition to the bursting of the blue moon, the other six The power of the secret sword is far less than the destruction. Gordon said that the other six secret swords are learned by himself from the elves of the elves, and taught to Richard, and the real elf sword. There must be a gap, because Gotton has no elf blood at all, and forcibly simulating the seven-string moon force with his own strength, he barely used the seven-type secret sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Sword is the top tactic of the High Elves. The characteristics of the Elves are the higher the requirements of the more advanced tactics for the blood talent, the top tactics If you don't have the corresponding blood ability, you can't even learn. In fact, the high elves are a race of talent and class. The war skills and racial secrets they created are all branded. The elves' secret swords are naturally nondescript. As for the destruction, it was the same time that Ilani used to pierce the chest with this sword. Gordon was naturally impressed and learned the essence of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
