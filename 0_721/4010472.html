			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is quickly exhausted, the light fades away, Bruno suddenly When he was ten years old and his body was no longer strong, he said with self-deprecation: "This is the book I wrote, but I can only read it once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking down and meditating, I sat for half an hour. During this time, two strange warriors came out from outside, trying to get Richard to the painful temple, but they were solved by Naiyou and Shuihua. The pain can make people powerful, but at the same time it will weaken the soul. To deal with the monsters that come out of these painful temples, Nai's attack against the soul is extremely effective. Finally, Richard raised his head and said, "I understand that this book contains some of the rules that the god of courage has mastered, though not complete. But it is the cornerstone of his inheritance, thank you, Master Bruno."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can see the rules now." Bruno was shocked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See, maybe, but not clear enough." Richard smiled and gave an ambiguous answer. He stood up and said, "The Go to the painful hall to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Richard picked up Bruno’s charcoal and brushed a row on the black brick The digital symbols and the gods fill the gaps on the bricks and then leave with everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno’s gaze fell on the black bricks, and immediately the whole body was shocked. The sights could no longer be separated from the symbols. He’s been thinking about the problems for many years. The problem is solved in front of you. The problem is that this line only opens a door, and only opens a small slit, but from this door, you can already see the vast world behind the door, which is an indescribable The world, it may be too far away for ordinary people, but for people like Bruno, it is the ideal of pursuing the pursuit of life, but the world is really too far away, even if it is a madman like him, I also know that my life is too short, short enough to touch the world even if it is a ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno looked up and looked out the window. The figure of Richard and others had disappeared. He murmured: "I thought your ambition was just a mad thought. Now it seems that there may be real possibilities..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the temple of pain, Richard and others were standing there, sighing two giant doors of up to 30 meters. These are two doors made of ferrous metal. The surface is engraved with countless painful faces. Seeing these two doors is like seeing countless people crying and weeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wall of crying, this is the favorite decoration of the painful hell lords, I am now more and more curious about the identity of the guys hidden inside." Said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her breath, she began to smear a faint white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the wall of crying and asked, "If you really hide behind a guy from painful hell."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai Youshuang began to turn into a chaotic gray, revealing a horrible smile, saying: "That is, they are unlucky, I happen to be particularly good at dealing with the painful weapon of the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am more and more curious about your origins, it should not be as simple as an ordinary guardian." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, if you want to know, I can tell you in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is somewhat curious: "Well, you didn't say that the place you came to is not something you can't say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie secluded smile, said : "There will be loopholes in the strict rules. You should be clear about this, so I will definitely have a way to describe that place and all my origins, so that you can fully understand, this is for you. It should be a huge help, for example, some new rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new rule..." Richard revealed a smile, and It’s not a surprise in Nai’s thoughts. Richard now has six rules to wait for analysis. The time given to the fourth-order wisdom talent is that it takes almost two million days to get these six kinds. The rules system is all set up, and then... then fully resolved, that is, the mastery of the secular sense, what is needed Among other terms, secluded Nai said the new rules, presumably yet another system, is indeed very attractive, but Richard have lived long enough for the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that Naiyou can’t understand. Strictly speaking, as long as Richard has enough time, many rules can be solved and mastered. However, Richard does not have such a long time, so instead of adding more rules to the system, it is better to concentrate on analyzing some of the rules that are tangible and tangible. For example, the rule system recorded from the tree of life. It is the simplest one, and it can improve the ability of Richard in the short term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nai’s observations immediately added: “This is just one of them. In addition, if you choose the guardian of the day at the next sacrifice, I can make her become a similar existence to me and Io, in that place, I still have a sister who is waiting to see the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the 'sister' that Nai You said, and Io suddenly swallowed his forehead, but Richard I was quite interested, and then asked: "But the Guardian of this election will not listen to my orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Guardian of Heaven is only loyal to summoning The masters who came out of them, this can be proved at the sacrificial ceremony. It can be said that the loyalty of the guardian of heaven is endorsed by the eternal and the credibility of the dragon of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou’s words are very tempting, but Richard always feels that something is not quite right, but the specifics are wrong, but they can’t be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then what do you want to get." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need the grace of God, the guardians of the heavens are all in need of grace to advance, from my legend, to the grace of three top sacrifices. But when I get to the 19th level, I can help you to contact my sister. At the 20th level, I can tell you about that place and my experience." Naiyou is very serious and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is still a top sacrifice, you can go to the legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou immediately Answer: "That sacrifice I want to find a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will seriously consider it." Said, Richard and the quicksand exchanged a look, But seeing the sand is just shrugging, which is what he decides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant was shocked and angry. This time he pulled the horn of Lanai’s clothes and angered: "Dignity, dignity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou said innocently: "What is dignity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the sky The vaguely huge face emerged again. This time he looked very angry. The thunderous voice shook the earth and trembled: "You have already arrived at the door of my temple, but still refused to come in. This is for me. Insult, you will pay for your arrogance, and Nei will punish your soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled indifferently, didn't look at the huge face in the sky, but said to a distorted face on the wall crying in front of him: "Let's threaten me, honestly open the door, I am not interested in touching you." The face, if you don't open the door, then we will leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face suddenly moved, showing a surprised expression, then he laughed It’s up, saying, “You can find me from so many faces. It’s not easy. If so, let you come in.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Just in front of Richard, the two walls of crying slowly opened. It was not the sound of rubbing, but the sound of crying like a baby, and a deep passage behind the door, at first glance At the end of the day, Richard did not rush into the room, but looked into the depths and mobilized the ability to gain insight. The light from his eyes illuminated the dark passage and reflected many illusory shadows. Once exposed to the light, it immediately ignited as a smoke, and then turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-faced shadow, this kind of thing is also a good idea to come out." Richard laughed and strode into the painful hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-plane shadow is a rather strange life, they are similar to the ghosts in the undead, but they are dragging on the plane and the half plane. There is a kind of monster that attacks the soul for a living, but they must exist in the darkness. Once they are illuminated by the light, they will be pulled into the plane and will be destroyed immediately. The half-plane shadow is in many sub-levels. The plane is a horrible killer, and it is also the favorite minion of many evil wizards and evil creatures. But in Noland, this thing has been studied without secrets, but some wizards who have some ideas will raise a large group, the purpose is only Use their characteristics to find spatial gaps to other planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a disturbing whisper in the depths of the temple, and then it was silent, Richard was walking first, the sand was followed, and the whole team was in Iraq. After the Russian pad, at this moment, the star in the high altitude is descending, and the 50-riding elite knights on the back are all equipped and ready to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the star lingering in the lead cloud, but how can not get a thick cloud, calculate the distance, it has dropped several kilometers, under normal circumstances I have already drilled into the underground and I don’t know how deep it is. Now how is it surrounded by lead clouds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of pain, Richard suddenly stopped and his face was dignified for the first time, saying: "We may have trouble."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
