			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search the bottom ten floors of the city, and then the middle area It is. The troll empire's warriors, hunters and some small princes live in this city. From this level, in addition to the stone houses where the trolls live, there are more squares and shrines. The roads are also much wider, and the roads are made of stones. At the edge of the city, it is a stone channel that diverts water. Now the water channel in this urban area has already dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into a temple, and the temple was not very large, but it was exceptionally high. The altar on the center should have been the image of Zuka, but now it has become a pile of gravel. From the traces, it seems to be deliberately destroyed by something. On the walls on either side of the temple, the teachings of Zuka and the patterns of battle are engraved. Due to the age, the pigments in the pattern have already peeled off, but the content can still be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sand was busy with the textual teachings, Richard was looking at the murals. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mural, a huge, bifurcated feather snake is draped over the altar and is accepting countless troll sacrifices below. The feather snake in this painting is the sacred ancestor of the troll empire. In another mural, the Feather Snake is fighting with a giant bear that is not inferior to it, and a huge spider. Below them, the trolls, which are clearly divided into three camps, fought together. Richard has a high degree of accomplishment in painting. It is seen that although the murals are extremely primitive, the scale is very accurate. Compared with the three heads of the Holy Spirit, the troll warriors are not much bigger than the ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard knows that an adult troll is generally about two and a half meters tall, and a strong warrior can even exceed three meters. According to the proportion of the murals, the Holy Spirit will even be as high as 100 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard studied murals, he suddenly gave birth to a warning sign and suddenly turned his head! For a moment, Richard saw a troll quietly turning out from the altar, and rushed to the sand without a sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strong troll, more than two meters five tall, the head of the mane is stained with blood red, two long fangs from the mouth Stretch out. It has agility that doesn't match the huge body shape, and it is so fast that it can't even save the rescue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll's hand grasps the back of the flowing sand. However, when its palm with only four fingers just touched the sanding skin, the dripping neck chain in the flowing sand neck suddenly burst into a very strong glare. For a moment, the trolls were all blank in sight, and they could not see anything at all. . The troll screamed and suddenly covered his eyes. The sand drifted from the ground, lifting the foot against a troll's toe, and then the book of time in the hand slammed on the troll's waist. The trolls whose eyes were injured and subconsciously leaned back were swayed by the sand, and they could not help but retreat. However, its toes were being firmly slammed by the flowing sand. Under the pull, a crisp crack of the bones was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll screamed in pain, and the back hit the wall of the temple, and the entire temple was shaken for a moment. It rubbed his eyes hard and finally recovered his vision, so he stared at the bloodshot eyes, staring at the flowing sand brutally, and his mouth continued to make a low roar. The temple suddenly shook, and Tiramisu ran like a giant elephant, and slammed into the troll! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre is born with a greater power than the troll, and it is a thirteenth level to the top ten, so this troll is directly hit and flew in the temple. On the back wall, then fell to the ground. It was struggling to get up, and Tiramisu rushed up again, stepping on the troll's waist, and after a crack in the bones, the troll could no longer stand up. But it is still roaring, propping up with both hands and wanting to attack. The vitality of the trolls is powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard gave a detective to the troll, and then carefully looked at his bloodshot eyes, and finally shook his head and said, "He has no wisdom, can't ask anything. Kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu squats and slams into the back of the troll. The terrible power of the ogre directly destroyed the skull of the troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that Richard is unexpectedly brutal to Tiramisu. The ogre and the troll actually have similar bloodlines. They are said to be descendants of the same ancient species, but one inherits a huge force and the other inherits a very strong vitality. But the similar blood does not allow them to support each other, but instead becomes the root of feud. Both races believe in the bones that they can get the ability of each other as long as they devour each other. So once the troll and the ogre meet, it is often a desperate war. In the troll kingdom, the ogre must be completely extinct, and vice versa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu, which is about to give birth to a second head, is absolutely synonymous with nobleness and wisdom in the ogre. He certainly does not think that eating trolls can really get the strength of the other side, but the natural hatred in the race instinct is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand chanted a spell, releasing a raging power between his hands and pouring it on the body of the troll. Then there were some light green lights floating around the troll's head, which flashed a few times and dispersed in the air. When I saw some green awns, Liu Sha said to Richard: "The troll has traces of divine reaction. It seems that you are right, we can find something that can serve as a sacrifice here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the trolls and looked at the murals on the wall. Shen Yan said: "But we still have to be careful, not sure what Zuka is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand patted the book of time in his hand and said, "The Holy Spirit that accepts the sacrifices is now only a soul. Otherwise the troll city will not die. To deal with the Holy Spirit of this soul class, I have a way. Your unicorn will also be very useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are saying There was a fierce fighting sound coming from outside. Richard immediately rushed out of the temple, just to see the battle of the gods in the distance, the brilliance of the gods, a light back throwing a huge troll on the ground, then waving the scepter in the hand, breaking the giant The skull of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Iowo waved to him and laughed loudly: "A fourteen-level battle sergeant, killing a talented ten-level giant Devil, isn't it a very easy thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult trolls are indeed around ten, but their natural strength and strong vitality will make ten The second-level fighters also have a headache. Fighting priests, even big priests, will not easily kill opponents through melee as easily as Io. Richard also keenly captured a key word, fourteen. It seems that although the promotion of the Russian-Israeli is a little later than his own claim, it is not too late. From the time of the emergence of Iraq and Russia to just a few months now, he has jumped two levels in a row, making Richard very surprised. Is this guy really a special care for the eternal and time dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked a little gloomy, but the blood in his body began to burn slowly. If necessary, he is not afraid to fight with Io, whether he is 14 or 16. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of Richard, Io strode to a horse riding a baggage and opened the magic box on the horse. It was the box of Iowa, and Richard never saw him open. From the magic box, Iowa actually took out a set of pale gold ornate chain! Later, he took off the robes of the gods, put on the chain, and then twisted the scepter in his hand. The big head was immediately divided into three lobes and fell. Each club head is connected by a silver chain and a handle. In a twinkling of an eye, the Italian and Russian scepter became a beautiful and overbearing three-headed chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
