Even if they are not true The devils will also be treated as devils. They will be related to them, no matter what the reason, they will be regarded as the devil's companions, tied to the temple of the god of courage to burn! You... how can you do this? When things come!" When Sir Cokat snarled, he deliberately lowered his voice, for fear of being heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of the jazz, Ma Wen is leaning comfortably on the sofa and savoring the rich black tea. When Sir Corkart’s anger subsided a little, he said leisurely: “Father, the situation is that I have become a devil’s companion, you can look at this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Speaking, Marvin stretched out his right hand and suddenly jumped into a faint dark red flame on his hand, which seemed to have solidified centuries of blood. The flames flashed away, and Marvin’s face turned pale and gasped. Although the dark flame lasted for a short time, it consumed most of his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Cokat suddenly took a breath and said: "Shadow flame! You, you become a fallen wizard?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have only six levels, so I can only be called a fallen priest, and I am not qualified to be called a theologian." Marvin calmly corrected the jazz's mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which god are you new to?" The jazz stared at Marvin and asked nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal and the Dragon of Time." Marvin said, then added: "It is not the god of our plane."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kokal’s face is indefinite, slowly saying: “The ability to transmit power across the plane, no matter what, this eternal and time dragon is a powerful and powerful god. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvin poured himself a cup of tea and smiled and said, "My dear father, now you should believe that I am already tied to the devil. You can't separate again. And you, the father of a fallen pastor, will be sent to the firearm once it is discovered. So instead of anger, it would be better to help me think about it. These interracial intruders obviously don’t They are as young as the priests of the temple. They are very young, most of them are less than twenty years old, but their combat power is amazingly powerful. You can imagine that there are dozens of invaders around the tenth level, and there is no strong equipment. Under the circumstances, in the case of a frontal battle, let Mintel and Hu Bo lead But the team that wiped out half of the baron elite "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;?! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Jazz grunted heavily, did not say anything. Marvin is his son and naturally he will not lie. Obviously, the identity of these invaders in the original plane is inevitably not simple, and most of them are standing behind some very terrifying forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cokat went back and forth in the living room for dozens of laps before making up his mind and said: "The Duke of the Wolf, the column, may be able to solve the problem for you." The problem of the point. The family of the Duke of Biele is a family ancestor, and there is often a conflict with the temple of the god of courage. I will write a letter of introduction to you, and you will take him to find the baron of Fang Dan, who is the cousin of the duke. Introduce the Duke for you. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jazz paused and looked at Marvin with concern, saying: "But the tyrannical tyranny of the Duke of the Wolf, You must be careful when dealing with him. If he is in a bad mood, he may tear you off directly! In addition, this is the map of the Baron Castle of Fossa you want, I can only help you so much. When leaving Be careful, don't let people recognize you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wen took a thick piece of parchment and carefully collected the letter of introduction before he slammed the jazz and said, "Father, I have a hunch that you will not regret it for today's decision."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocker snorted and said nothing. Even if it is a six-level fallen priest, Marvin’s age is not an achievement. For the foresight and prophecy of a type of magic, at least a priest of 12 or above can be cast, and a priest with a strong enough grace. Marvin’s hunch is obviously nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the study of Baron Fossa, a vase more expensive than the Coca-Cola collection flew to the wall, and the slamming into countless pieces . There are already many fragments on the floor, and the baron is obviously in a bad mood. After the vase was finished, the baron gasped and slammed a punch on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the storm, the servant who indented into the corner of the study room dared to open the door: "Adult, the Essien priest of the temple has been waiting for you for half an hour." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farsa snorted and sorted out the messy hair, and then slowly followed the servant to the living room. Essien is the priest of the god of courage, and his rank has reached 12, and he is also the host of the temple on his territory. On the status and power of secularism, Essien is no worse than the baron in his remote area. Two consecutive defeats, the baron's strength is greatly damaged, especially the high-end combat power is more than half. Now, Essien’s 30-man Shrine Knight has become a pivotal force in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron of Fossa is lean and his hair is mostly white. The long-term overactive nightlife left him with a pale face and deep eye bags. As soon as he entered the living room, the baron said that he was admiring the painting of a spring goddess oil painting on the wall. "The honorable Lord Essin, if you are looking for me to talk about the ectopic devil, then I want to We have nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essie smiled a little and did not put the baron's coldness on his heart, but said: "Lord Baron, I am this time. Come over is to discuss the ectopic face of the devil. You know the gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me!" Fossa raised his voice angrily "What is the content of God, you only know! If the strength of those invaders is really just 'insignificant', the number is no more than 20 people, then how can I send three jazz and hundreds of elite fighters? "The whole army is annihilated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien’s face is positive, saying: "God is not wrong, I am the priest who serves the god of courage, not even It may lie on the things of the gods. There is only one explanation in the front of the battle, that is... ., Baron adults, you should really take training at army "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Buddha Sa snorted, very ugly face, but did not speak. Essien was too incompetent in accusing his men, and the baron himself got the battle report, and the conclusion was actually made after thinking about it. But now he is at a loss, the remaining two jazz are not known for their strength, but rely on the blood and the nepotism, and even less likely to send out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fausa, now your situation is not very good, my advice to you is to ask the Earl of Galleon for help as soon as possible. If you send a messenger now You can reach the Earl's Castle in three days, and we have time to catch the invaders. You lose only a little money and reputation, which is much better than another incident in Jovan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron said coldly: "Even if the Earl is able to respond to me, his army will take at least ten days to arrive. What time is the temple ready to do?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
