The power of the Faro dwarf musket is so bad, or because it is made according to the Faro standard, and the shield and armor of the Upper Noland standard seem to be weak, just like the strongest of Faro in Noland. Nothing can be considered in front of the same level. If you follow the Norland defense equipment as a reference standard and can achieve the corresponding level of attack power of Faro, there is much to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was not an imaginary, he began to think about the details and found more and more problems. For example, the magical effect of the projectile, the manufacturing process of the musket, and the characteristics of the gunpowder, and even how to develop the magical power associated with the spark. If you want to be more detailed, the manufacturing process of the musket can be subdivided into hundreds of fine items such as casting, polishing, and machine design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in order to lower the overall cost, it is necessary to overcome many manufacturing problems. Otherwise, a flaming gun that was produced by an alchemist for three years could indeed reach the epic level, but lost the original meaning of the musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of Nyris, Richard smiled and said: "This is not a job that will be completed in a while. I estimate that it will be available within five years. The progress has been good. However, we are going to start preparing now. I think that a unit equipped with a modified musket with a quantity of 5,000 or even 10,000 will definitely help your points." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’ eyes are immediately bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's talk about business now! I need a bunch of magic books recently. This is a list. Can you help me find a way to collect it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris took a look at the list and saw some of the basic books on the magic array and the knowledge of the structure, which are in the Royal Library. All can be found, so nodded: "This is a small matter, but it may take a few days for the copy to be copied. But you should not use it before, my holy builder!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not for me, it’s for Becky.” Richard tells the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"珞琪!" Niris was taken aback, read the list again, his face became very weird, and he looked deeply at Richard. Said: "Is there a talent for the architect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "Sometimes the so-called talent can also be piled up by accumulation and diligence. I don't know how far she can go, but it's okay to be a normal builder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris shakes his head and sighs , said: "You are a baby! Menza family idiots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said: "No way, I am lucky. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Nyris took a sip, how to look charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and pointed at Richard and said, "You listen to me, Qi Qi is now a friend with me and Agamemnon! You I can get better for her in the future, otherwise I will not let you go first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Qi Qi are already friends? When? I have never seen you have exchanges!" Richard asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is when she may become a builder. I and she can get to know it very early!" Nyris answered with conviction and made Richard laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you going to let me go?" Richard began to provoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris was shocked and asked suspiciously: "Do you want to fight with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you mean!" said Li Xiaoxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris covered his face with his hand, and he couldn’t bear it. He said, "I bully you a magician. I really can’t bear it! No! I can't do this kind of thing! It's too cruel! Come here, take my guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to say anything, Rees said again: "Let's do it, I only use twelve levels of vindictiveness to deal with you! Just like this, let's play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s mouth opened Zhang I can't say a word. Looking at Nyris's sword, but standing only ten meters away from himself, more speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distance is in the eye of Nyris's ability, and Richard has only instant magic available. In the final battle with the magician, the default hidden rule is to open a distance of 30 meters, and in the case of the magician ready, Nyris obviously does not intend to behave. And this guy was originally a seventeen-level, fighting skills farther than the vindictive level, how much to use vindictiveness, in fact, his impact on combat effectiveness is not too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still planning to attack?" Richard said sarcastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible! Of course you have to start!" Nyris said that he was so upright that he couldn’t help but screw his face. Well, it seems that the face is screwed up and feels worse than Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard no longer craps with him, pulling his knife in hand. This time he brought the long-named elf knife. After being raised by the tree of life, the elf knife did not add new attributes, but it was lighter and more flexible. The whole knife showed a vitality. Richard used it very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chang’s knife pointed to the sky and a lightning bolt appeared on the tip of the knife. The electric fire was overflowing and did not fly to Nyris, but instead slammed into Richard! The electric fire was divided into five lanes, which were respectively hit in five places on the body of Li, and Li’s body was immediately wrapped around a flash of light, just like the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at a strange smile on the face of Richard’s mouth, and then looked at his electric fire, almost standing out of thin air, and his heart was suddenly disturbed. He did not say a word, a step forward, the whole person pulled out a series of afterimages, and the sword edge stabbed Richard! As soon as he took the shot, he was already working hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has judged that Richard wants to dodge, and then begins to conceive the killing plan in his heart. With his combat skills, any magician who is entangled in him can only drink and hate on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whispered, Niris’s sword was held by Richard’s knife, and the power from the sword was so great that Niris Surprised! He knows that Richard has no strength in power. Although the Dark Blue Wizard is famous for his strength, he is definitely not strong enough to compete with him. But the power of this knife is at least equal to the power of the 12th-level fighter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris did not think that he would be blocked by Richard’s front face, and almost instinctively urged a stronger vindictiveness. The latter moves have lost their effect. When he was in a stagnation, Richard held the knife in both hands, his hands flashed on the arms, and the long knife turned over, with a strong wind, swept Nyris waist ribs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this knife made Niris a big surprise. He couldn’t reach the strength of the sword. He could only put the sword in the vertical and rushed to set up the knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now both sides are equivalent to the 12th level of combat power, but Richard is fully attacked, and Nyris has been rushing to parry, and with both hands to one hand, the result Neris was a shackle and was swept a few meters by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s left hand made a gesture in the void, and an instant acceleration on himself, this only calmly chased Nyris. Niris had a chance to breathe, and the foot slipped ten meters away. However, Richard has followed the shadow, and under the effect of acceleration, Nyris has lost his speed advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerris was surprised again, seeing Richard’s sinister savage, he had to raise his sword on the blade and wanted to use his sword skills to The long knife is biased. Unexpectedly, Richard’s long knife suddenly shocked, and he collided with Neris’s sword and made a hard fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a knife, Richard was shouting, and the whole body was surging, and the long knife rushed to Nyris like a squally shower. Every knife was fast. Heavy, no tricks, straight to kill Nyris sweating! Niris felt that as long as he showed a slight flaw, he would immediately be caught by Richard and the illusion of nothing is useless. He wants to make the best solution, and with his keen perception, he can barely block the mad attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris did not notice that Richard’s eyes were faintly light at the moment, and he was almost invisible under analytical talent. Through the change of his fighting airflow, Richard can almost determine his next move, naturally giving a head-on blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nyris’s combat skills and combat consciousness are the top choices. Although at an absolute disadvantage, the long sword is still erratic and difficult to defend. Never been attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the development of the next battle made Neris almost scream! While maintaining a stormy offensive, Richard began to constantly bless himself with instant magic and harassed Nyris. When Nyris hangs on the fourth negative state, she feels that she will collapse if she insists on it for a little more! He only remembered that Richard was originally a magician, a damn magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nyris forgot, he had been thinking about how to marry a magician before the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard gave himself a magic shield, Niris was still wondering that he would not use magic at all, why did Richard use it for himself? Instantly bless a magic shield that can defend against five levels? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nyris was clever and responsive, and his cold hair was immediately erected. He shouted: "Richard! You bastard!!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is sure that the next one will be bombarded with a range of magical shields that are not anti-Nyris, but against his own magic. Sure enough, Richard’s right-handed long knife was still arrogant, and there was already a floating dark red fireball in his left hand. Nyris did not even notice when he finished the magic preparation. Richard did not say anything, just take the fireball to the feet of Nyris! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris screamed, and a flipped back escaped. Richard's fireball looks very weird, and experience tells him that this thing doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball burst and turned into a thick, viscous fire. The fire wave is dark red in the dark, the speed is not very fast, but the hidden scent of the inside makes Niris's heart tremble. When he saw that the spilled flame would stick to something, and then burned it, the heart couldn’t help but scream. If you think of it as a normal fireball, if you want to rely on vindictiveness, then you will be completely ruined. The 12th-level vindictiveness will definitely be defeated under this magical flame. If he is forced out of the seventeen-level vindictiveness, it will definitely be lost. And the loss is very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
