Whenever he feels, he will write his thoughts in this diary. According to Essien's research, from the important gods of the god of courage over the years, the invasion of the ectopic plane has occurred more than once in the history of the plane. The turmoil caused by each time is large and small, and the invaders who come are also strange. The number of intruders who are human is not too much or too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the prophecy of such planes, the god of courage is always confused with the gods of most of the gods in this plane. However, there are traces to be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Essien’s analysis, there are generally two key words about the invader’s gods, first the average strength of the intruder, followed by the size of the intruder. . In terms of strength, insignificant means that the invaders are below the average level of ten, but the number of such gods is extremely rare, only once in history. The slightest threat is below the thirteenth level, and quite strength refers to the fifteenth level or less. Those above the 16th level are referred to as very dangerous. As for the size of the scale, it is not very important compared to the level. The largest number of intruders is only a hundred people. Therefore, only a large number of such words appear only occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the entire plane gods, the power of these invaders in history is mostly nothing, and some of the top powers in the plane are out of any One is enough to level them. In general, destroying intruders does not require the use of such top-ranking powerhouses. Most of the incidents are resolved at the local affairs level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was also a very tyrannical intruder entering the plane, the intruder was three star beasts from a certain astral plane. After an earth-shattering battle, the top powers of this plane almost died, and even the gods fell. The northwest corner of the mainland was separated from the land and floated to the sea, becoming an island. At such a huge price, the three star beasts were killed and the plane of the astral plane leading to the plane was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true face of that battle in the past has been impossible to pursue in the silence of the gods. Only the most secret collections in the temple retain the record of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this diary, Essien wrote a simple statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Is it that war is the theme of the plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question was issued by Essien in the twelfth year after the initial study of the alien face devil invasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a lot of diary, and the descriptions and comments are just a few words, but it can be seen that Essien is not simple. It is only a matter of divine power and faith, so he is at best a good priest. It is doubtful whether this life is likely to reach the 16th level. In this plane, no matter which profession, reaching the 16th level is a qualitative change. The servant will become a holy warrior, the priest will be promoted to a great priest, and the magician will become a great mentor. But after reading the diary, Essien in the eyes of Richard became a wise man, and his wisdom far exceeded his beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the diary of the most recent year, it can be seen that Essien began to purposefully search for ancient ruins and some places where strange events occurred. He was willing to run to the temple on the edge of the Principality of White Rock, which is because the Principality of White Rock is close to the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain area where Richard is currently located is the corner of the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called turbulent land, in fact, the area is very large, with a distance of more than 100,000 square kilometers, only some areas on the extreme edge are connected with human settlements. The terrain here is sinister, and there are mountains and mountains, deep trenches and cliffs, and there are often rare high-end monsters. The turbulent land is located in the middle of the Fengrao Plain and the Red Rock Highlands. It is connected to the blood-stained area in the north. There are often turbulences in time and space, and creatures with ectopic surfaces flow. For a long time, no one knows how many strange races have been hidden in the depths of the turbulent land. The purpose of Essien is to find the remains of the turbulent land and the ruins left by the time storm. He tries to explore the true mysteries of the depths of the plane through these relics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien’s ambition is great, he wants to figure out the nature of the plane and time, and find a way to connect to other planes. Because he found that the repeated ectopic invasions seem to have no connection with each other, but if you look at the history of 10,000 years, you can actually find that the power of the plane is slowly falling. The reason for the decline, according to Essin's guess, is actually the decline of the strength of the plane gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a wave of intruders, the face gods will release a round of gods, the stronger the intruder, the gods must be safe for the believers Show the gods more clearly. The prophecy of things outside the plane is actually a consumption of divine power. If the prophecy is very accurate and clear, the consumption will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From nowadays, the shrinking power of the entire plane can also counteract Essien’s inference that after the World War I, the plane has not recovered, the strong The number is now only two-thirds of the heyday, and what’s even worse is that the fallen god of war was not filled with new gods, and there is no new god in these years. Other gods, saints, and prayers The number of people is far from being restored to pre-war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thirteenth year of the ectopic invasion of the devil, Essien finally came up with a conjecture that this plane is not the only plane with the true God. This conjecture has been contrary to the teachings of most gods. If this diary is leaked out, then he will be burned to death on the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Essien believes that since the nature of the relationship between planes is plunder and war, then resources and power are crucial. If you want to break the deadlock, you can only find a way to open the ectopic plane and win in the plane war, thus plundering the wealth, resources and talents of the ectopic plane, so as to strengthen the strength of the plane, so that at least The overall strength to maintain the position is no longer falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard can’t help but be dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here the shrine of the gods, this plane is called Faro. Judging from the contents of the diary, most of the so-called ectopic invasions in the past were actually that some expeditions occasionally came to this plane through the unstable gap of time, and did not experience the true plane war. . Even the star-shaped beast that once caused the heavy surface of the plane should be similar to the occasional entry of some powerful people who can directly shuttle the plane, such as the character of the teacher Su Helun of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Noland, the plane war has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and there is more than one rich space behind the giants that stand still. . For this reason, the war between the great nobility in Noland has even exceeded the war between ordinary sub-level countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that when Richard saw Gotton last time, the Marquis was setting up a mission to gradually eclipse a plane. Because the plane war is so important, the related works are as many as stars. Even a complete set of standard operating procedures from intrusion, footing, expansion to complete occupation has been formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
