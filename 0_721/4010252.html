The value of an advanced plane can be said to be above any tangible treasure. It is the sharing of several large families, and they can all obtain huge benefits that are satisfactory enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond slowed down the voice at this time and said, "Now Richard has just returned from the Greenson plane. If we launch an attack at this time, we will definitely fight." He was caught off guard. If he could kill him in Faro, then of course it would be once and for all. If we couldn’t do it... then hold the control of Faro and destroy the foundation of his rapid rise, I thought of that time, we There is also the basis for peace talks with him. This is why the coalition forces, I strongly disagree with the reasons for Mensa and Schumpeter to join."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Peace talk?" A majestic middle-aged man frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, peace talks." Raymond calmly looked at him, although in terms of personal strength, ten Raymonds were not enough for him to kill with one finger. of. But on the momentum, Raymond is even better: "If we fail to kill him in the plane war, it is endless trouble. Although it destroys his foundation, but for a future holy builder If you want to make a comeback, it will be easier. In the position of the Holy Alliance, can we openly kill Richard in Noland? It will certainly call the wrath of the Emperor, and the Highness of Su Hailun will inevitably intervene. At least our Joseph family has not yet reached the point where they can fight against both of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, if we kill Richard in the Faro plane, or if we want to kill Richard on the battlefield in the future, there will be no Any sequelae." Raymond thought about it and added: "In fact, as far as my personal point of view is concerned, if you stand on the position of the Holy Alliance, leaving a big structor attached to the royal family is not an unacceptable result. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, just do it!" The majestic middle-aged man finally focused on the bottom. The big men here are all aware of Raymond’s words, and the enemy is not only in the ectopic face. Raymond satisfactorily looked around for a week and said, "Okay, let's finally confirm the strength comparison. This time we have several families who have invested in the Faro plane." There are a total of 30,000 coalition forces, including the Knights of the 50th Mount, the Sanctuary and the Great Magisters. There are overwhelming advantages in the strength. From the recent Armenian family's recent arms procurement list, I estimate that there will be no more than 5,000 troops on the Richard side. At least there are so many fighters with at least combat power. There is no Sanctuary and a great Magister. He may have three to four of the allies in the Faro's position to reach the Sanctuary level. The strong, but unable to confront us. Richard itself is a builder, but he has handed over a lot of structures to the royal family, so he has at most five knights in his own hands. So, this is Our real enemy is actually the power of the local gods of Faro, but the difficulty lies in how to find out from the Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a Wait." The middle-aged woman raised another question: "You just said that there are only five members in the hands of Richard. Cavaliers, but Archimonde has recently publicly recruited candidate knights! This has been spread throughout the Holy Alliance. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Raymond smiled and said: "It's very simple, Richard is shocking. I want to pass a signal, that is, his majesty will soon have a strong team of knights, let all still People in the Archimonde territory have rethought the strategy, at least hesitating. This way, you can give Archimonde a breathing time, and what Richard is missing most is time. If we don’t Hands-on, at that time, he really had a terrible team of knights. In fact, I dare to confirm that there are not many knights in the hands of Richard. There is another reason for the time. Just a little calculation can tell In such a short period of time, Richard definitely can't make many suits. In addition to handing over to the royal family, it is incredible that he can have five sets of suits on his hands. In addition, the network is also his bottleneck, Ake Mond’s unconventional tradition has helped us Busy "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The middle-aged woman nodded and she thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone has agreed to attack Faro, then we will start the chess piece and get back the coordinates of Faro!" said Raymond. I took out a strange alchemy machine and placed it on the table. This alchemy machine is so precise that it is like a magic clock. The top of the dial is lined up with more than a dozen dials. Each dial is divided into four areas, each with a pointer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VIPs looked at each other and then walked to the stage one by one, and pressed their hands on the alchemy machine. Everyone pressed and the alchemy machine would click. Bright a few points. When the last old Joseph also put his palms up, the alchemy machine suddenly flashed through the body, shooting a long beam of light, and shot straight up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beam does not seem to belong to this plane, the ceiling of the war room is not blocked, it is directly penetrated, disappeared into the endless void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Faro plane, a free Archimonde warrior suddenly woke up from a deep sleep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and the other soldier in the barracks was sleeping deeply. This is the treatment of the bottom officer, and two people share a barracks. The free Archimonde muttered a few words and got up and went out to see the room, thinking of the night toilet. The officer in the same room with him did not pay much attention. He just turned over and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oasis City, the night is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time lighthouse disguised as a magic tower is quietly standing in the corner of the city, becoming a unique landscape. If someone comes back to attack Oasis City, they will find that the Time Lighthouse has really been used as a magic tower. Richard has already shipped a large number of parts, adding the magic tower function to it. Only this magic tower can't be upgraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the gate of the time lighthouse, two guards stood. They are all humanoid knights who dismount and are responsible for checking the people entering and leaving the magic tower. The humanoid knights are the most fair and strict, and they have never understood what is called human. The guards used to serve as important areas are the most appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious Free Archimonde warriors have just approached the gates of Time Lighthouse, and two humanoid knights stopped his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the humanoid knights said in a blunt tone: "Hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here "Free Archimonde warrior rummaged in his arms, and he didn't seem to touch it at the moment, so he muttered something while he was unconsciously moving forward two steps, further close to two humanoid knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the free Archimonde warrior finally pulled out of his arms, but the cold is not a warrant, but a short sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short sword quickly penetrated into the abdomen of a humanoid knight, and the humanoid knight opened his mouth and couldn’t make a sound. At the same time, the free Archimonde warrior almost smashed into the arms of another humanoid knight. He stretched his arm and grabbed his neck. With a force, he twisted the neck of the humanoid knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free Archimonde warrior grabs the enchanted sword of the humanoid knight, swings the sword like the wind, and quickly penetrates into the humanoid knight's buttocks, thighs, shoulders, etc. In a place that seems to be not fatal at all, a few swords went down, and the fierce humanoid knight immediately froze, and then slowly stopped struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to fight side by side with the humanoid knight. It is clear that these knights are similar to humans, but they should be another race, one born. For the race of warriors, their fatality is also different from that of human beings. The battle is much more, seeing the humanoid knight dying, and slowly he knows where the humanoid knight is the real deadly, and those parts can stop them from sending out warnings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
