Stricker immediately jumped off the horse and waved a giant axe to fight with the black warrior. Although the black warrior is powerful, the reaction is not flexible enough. Stricker could have taken an absolute advantage, but Gangde has since rushed. In two-on-one, Sticker had already had some difficulty, and then the magical light flashed, and he was busy chasing the cavalry. Tiramisu, who was running from him, had a slow operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not eager to shoot, but is in the middle of the command, constantly sensing the battlefield environment and situation. Suddenly he noticed that the time was ripe, so he shouted: "The two-winged cavalry retraced!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-winged step knights immediately retreated and shrank back into the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Orc retreats!" With the order of Richard, the Orc warriors began to retrace and contracted to the rear of the formation of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandru, thirty meters to the left, strengthen fear!" Richard's voice fell for five seconds, a group of almost invisible dim balls of light from damage The tent flew out, and then a strong magical wave spread spread around the ball of light, covering almost all the enemies of the left wing. More than half of the cavalry and their mounts immediately fell into chaos, screaming, and some screaming The ground, some are running aimlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s voice, another intensive fear was thrown in the right front forty meters, and the right-wing enemies began to confuse. The situation on the battlefield turned sharply. Under the leadership of the wind, the shrinking half-beasts seized the opportunity to attack again. They formed six distinct arrows, and in the meantime, more than ten cavalry were knocked down by Stilk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the positive side, Strick was entangled in the black warrior and Gangde, unable to get out. However, the five captains who had previously lost their horses quickly collapsed under the powerful assault of two ogres and splashes, and were killed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not continue to summon undead creatures, but began to continue to cursing Stich to weaken his combat power in accordance with Richard’s orders. When the captains who played the backbone were all killed, the battle quickly tilted. Richard began to command the troops to carry out a powerful repeated interspersed assault, and in a blink of an eye defeated the formation of ordinary cavalry. The powerful magic contractors began to besiege the Stich, and the Cavaliers under Richard's men spread to the two wings and began to smash the enemy's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has completely collapsed, so Stick’s men began to run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilke also felt more and more threatening, he suddenly screamed, the giant axe in the week of madness for a few weeks, the black warrior and Gangde Forced to retreat, and then roar again, even exhausted the power of the whole body to throw the giant axe to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant axe flew and the power was extremely fierce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde screamed and used all his strength to stop between Richard and the giant axe, and the broken heavy axe in his hand was on the flying axe. It was a loud thunderous bang, and the big axe of Gangde finally split into two halves and flew out. Gangde himself flew a few meters and slammed into the ground, and could not climb at all. Fortunately, the giant axe of the spin finally turned in the direction, swept through the side of Li, and cut the two half-orc warriors into two halves. The rest of the situation was not exhausted, and one end was inserted into the ground, and the handle of the axe kept vibrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s magical light flashes, magic shield, long-range protection, injury-free enchantment, and the entire three defensive magics have been bombarded under the impact of the giant axe Open, Richard himself was pushed a few meters to the side by the power of magic. To protect yourself with so much protection, even without the defense of Gangde, it is very difficult for Styx to completely kill Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing a giant axe, Strick immediately turned and fled to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the night is like a spiritual surge, the water splashes like a ghost behind him, the long knife never sleeps, the girl disappears, then the girl holds the knife Stand still and stop chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark breath, the strongest ability of the suit, suddenly appeared at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick can still run a hundred meters, the back armor suddenly split, spewing a flag-like blood fog. He struggled to move forward two more steps and finally fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidick fell, the remaining cavalry finally had no fighting spirit, a small part of it was scattered, and more than a dozen surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to the magical axe that was still inserted on the ground, gently stroking the handle of the axe, the hand seemed to be slightly fixed, in fact, the fingertips were Slightly trembling. Strick's flying axe is very powerful. If Richard's magic defense doesn't work, it's sure to be killed by the flying axe. At that time, unless the quicksand was a 18th-level god, it was possible to save Richard's life by resurrection, and the side effects of resurrection were almost equal to its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, under heavy escorts, it is unlikely that Richard will be hit in the front. But seeing the powerful axe coming in the face, Richard still feels like kissing the god of death again, and his heart shudders, but there is a strange excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling of dancing with the face of death seems to be the core inspiration of a series of makeup. Richard felt that he seemed to be somewhat paranoid and crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s doing a good job tonight, this is the first time you’ve won the battle by command alone! It seems that when we go back, Noland will not only Adding a future sacred sect, there will be a more talented commander." The sound of the sand is coming from behind Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a bit and shook his fist hard, so that he could relax his nervous fingers and lowered his voice and said, "Almost killed, what is good?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!" Liusha laughed and said, "You are a magician out of the dark blue!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Richard did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are in Noland, you only need to participate in the battle, many people will immediately know that you are a magician trained in dark blue." Liu Sha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very confused: "Is it impossible? I haven’t used any special magic at all? Maybe Dark Blue has its own unique magic, but that’s mostly The teacher’s unique legendary magic, I can’t learn it at all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand shakes his head and says: “It’s not a special magic, but a fighting style. But everything is dark blue. The magicians who came out were all physically strong, their life-saving ability was remarkable, and they were very self-protective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Noland, the magician There is always a reliable protection of the Cavaliers. At a critical juncture, the Cavaliers will react as if they were the only ones. Therefore, many magicians advocate the pursuit of the ultimate offensive force, rather than putting precious magic into too much of their own defense. Because on the battlefield, when the Knights of the Defence Master are knocked down, the magician itself will not live for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a slight glimpse, but I didn’t think of it. After the start of the battle, he commanded the dispatch and seized the gap to give himself all the protective magic that can be blessed. If it is not because of the dangers of reduced flexibility and speed, Richard will also give himself a stone skin surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
