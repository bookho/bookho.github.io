			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard passed through the territory of four nobles, he rushed into Soram When I was in the throne, Elliott’s North Road was just entering the sacred dynasty’s borders. This shows the speed of the action of Richard. The speed of the rapid march has disrupted the layout of the Duke, and the meticulously prefabricated encirclement has not yet worked. Useless, full-bodied benefits are reflected at this time, the strong are originally full of energy, the high-end arms of the mother's nest to restore the ability to chase the knight, they only need to rest for three hours a day, when necessary Continue to act for two or three consecutive days, provided that they are full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the Soram territory, Richard captured a small town, let the mayor prepare enough food for everyone to eat, and then start short Rest, in the town hall, Richard summoned all followers and discussed the next strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out on the magic map, pointing out the current position, and then circled the St. Louis Temple, drawing a straight line between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at Soram, I don’t know what we want to do. I want to go straight to the temple as quickly as possible, knock it down, the shrine where the temple is stationed. The Knights are not our opponents. As for the Duke of Soram, we can have a good time with him on the return trip. Do you have any questions?" After Richard finished, he looked at the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde took a glance at the map and said, "Hey, since we want to fool Soram, why not make it really realistic, we can do it first." Hit the Solam's old nest, scare him, then go where we want to go, and it won't be delayed for two days. The effect may be even better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said, nodded and said: "Just do it. Here, here and here, there are three established units of Soram, about 20,000 people, we will clean them up, especially It’s this reconnaissance cavalry, you must take it all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the magic clock and said: "We took a rest for two hours and tried tonight. Let them all solve, time is running out, go to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s only two hours." The ogre outside the window complained, two The hour is enough for him to fill his stomach, and the desire to sleep can't be realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You two can sleep in turn." Richard gave his own advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time this is the case." The ogre muttered, and then blamed the food on the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and shook his head, continued to study the map, and quickly deduced a possible battle in consciousness. At this moment, his consciousness suddenly seemed to be After touching it, the consciousness of an elite bat disappeared. These elite bats were used for reconnaissance and paid attention to hiding themselves, but they were still found by the other side to kill. In just one day, Richard’s elite bat lost. Six, Richard’s heart passed a shadow, knowing that this war is not as easy as Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the castle of the Duke of Soram, the 10,000 most elite knights have been assembled, and on the castle terrace, the duke of the full armor looks down on the troops that he is proud of. The knights are divided into ten teams. Each team's leading generals have a strong momentum. The 100-member knights are formed into a square array. Two front-runners are generals wearing armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are silent, the murderous looming over the entire square, in the eyes of Soram, there is a bloody atmosphere above the Cavaliers, there are countless ghosts The ghost is in the haunt, this is murderous, that is, this army has killed countless proofs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s lips twitched and said in a voice that only he could hear: “I have defeated Nylem, Archimondes, now it’s your turn. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, even in the face of Ellie, this unit did not play, but was placed on another more important battlefield, and Now, the Duke is going to use it to deal with Richard's large number of knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke raised his helmet and prepared to take it. He will personally lead the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a sudden surge of smoke in the distance. A knight appeared at the end of the road and ran to the castle at full speed, still several kilometers from the castle. He simply jumped out of the exhausted warhorse and ran to the castle faster than the running horse, and in the twinkling of an eye it was in front of the duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 17th-level tall knight, a powerful cavalry general under the Duke’s hand, but at the moment his armor is full of dirt and blood. Soram's pupils contracted and stared at him. The knight slammed on the knees and said in a hoarse voice: "Duke of the Duke, Richard suddenly changed the marching route and raided us. The sixth, seventh infantry regiment and the Lungma adult's light ride. The Corps has been defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soram took a deep breath and asked in the most gentle tone: "Longma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Longma has died, he died I dragged Richard and asked me to come back to report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soram took a deep breath and spit out slowly before asking "The Seventh Infantry Regiment is with you, how long have you resisted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-hour, Duke adults." The voice of the knight is slightly The trembling is obviously still shocking for the fierce battles that have just passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One thousand two thousand people, they only resisted for half an hour." The Duke's mouth was twitching, these are his regular army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are too many knights in Richard’s construction, we can’t stop their impact, they’re the first to charge... just cut through our formation. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Soram took a long breath and thought about it and said, "So, Richard is coming to me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers replied: "Yes, adults, you have to prepare in advance, Richard is less than a hundred kilometers away from here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke sneered a few times and said, "Well, I am here waiting for him, just two thousand people, and want to lay down my castle, Ramlen Send a few people to see the movements of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the Duke returned to the castle with a sly pace, waiting for Richard’s When the arrival, the knights did not enter the castle, but returned to the barracks. The duke was preparing to launch a decisive battle with Richard outside the castle. If the superior forces were to squash the castle guards, it would be too shameful, and maybe they would take Li. Scare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day passed nervously and calmly. In the early morning, when the Duke was woken up by the magic bell, he found that there was no military report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not yet appeared. Throughout the morning, the Duke stared at the map in the war room and waited for information from Ramron. Over time, The atmosphere in the combat room is becoming more and more oppressive. Richard has already arrived, and it has not yet appeared. Most of them have already been deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait until noon," the duke said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the slender Ramlen appeared like a ghost, saying: "Adult, Richard did not march here, judging from the traces left. He has already gone northwest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I have a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Mulren said: "I am very sorry, the Duke, the people I sent are dead. I have passed the time and got the exact information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Northwest direction..." The Duke stared at the map, his eyes again on the St. Louis Temple for a moment, and moved to other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Richard is about to leave the Duke of Soram, not far from the St. Louis Temple, and the two thousand knights are moving forward in a trot, sitting in the corner On the back of the beast, Richard is already thinking about the next move. He has the mother's nest and touches the rules. He has a special interest in the location of the temple. The more important the temple, the more important it will be. God's will comes, and as long as God has come, so much will leave a little bit of divine power. Before, Richard did not understand what the divine breath is, but relying on the judgment of vagueness, and now with the real talent has been promoted From the order to the insight, Richard has already understood that the so-called divine breath is actually the brand imprint of the power of the true God, even if it is only a little bit of branding, in theory, it can also resolve all the rules of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the conflict between Calando and the sacred dynasty, let Richard put the glory of the Lord into his ranks of enemies, and to the Church of St. Hui The style of acting, even if Richard wants to compromise, the Church of St. Hui will certainly not give up, not to mention that the sacred killing has clearly revealed the mind of Richard, which makes Richard in shock, but also on this weapon. There was a strong suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The St. Louis Temple is named after Saint Louis, Louis is the follower of the glory of the Lord before the fire, and later the martyr, who resists here The siege of the believers eventually died in the battle, and the glorious Lord who had not yet ignited the fire at that time managed to escape. As the Lord of Glory ignited the fire and became the true God, Louis became one of the Seven Holy Spirits, and the followers of the later generations died in his death. The temple was built in the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Seven Holy Spirits, and the Temple of the Holy Glory, is the most important eight temples of the Church of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
