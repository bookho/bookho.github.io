			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After controlling all the twisting rules, the real side of the dark area has all been presented to Richard. The masked veil of the past was completely opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and saw a completely different world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous people no longer blur, they are a life of just over a meter tall, with four lower limbs and two upper limbs. These aborigines were clearly intelligent lives, and Richard saw altars, houses, and tools in their villages. But now, the three villages are silent, and all the aborigines are dead. Both men, women and children, all died, and none of them survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original strength of Richard is already the peak of Noland, and the Holy Moonlight is still in the dark. In this case, there is no Aboriginal people who can escape the pursuit of Richard. Even the butcher can't stop Richard's knife, not to mention the indigenous people who are obviously weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the rules were analyzed, these aborigines were a piece of light and shadow, and even Richard could not see their form. No matter who it is, as long as it can be active and lively, Richard’s subconscious knives will be cut into two paragraphs. This is simply the instinctive reaction of Richard against the shadow creatures, without thinking, relying on instinct to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after seeing the real side of the world, Richard did not know what it was. The aborigines of the three villages are dead. But even if Richard does not kill them, it is as difficult for people in order to survive in dark areas. After eliminating the twisted nodes, these aborigines will not live long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it again, and the wilderness in front of him was another scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the area on the wilderness is still dead, but near the twisted nodes, it is full of vitality. From time to time on the ground, you can see some grass-like life growing vigorously. The farther away from the twisted nodes, the more sparse and fragile these grasses are. After a certain distance, it is simply a lifeless wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do these lives depend on the twisting rules to survive?" Richard could not help but have this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s state of mind is only a short-lived moment. On the way, he is still eliminating the twisted nodes that can be reached, but no longer deliberately detours to eliminate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard ignited the lighthouse, the whole place of dawn will return to the land of order. At that time, the orderly people in the holy city of nature will naturally cheer. But these aborigines will be completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, after eliminating the fifty-sixth twisted node, Richard finally found a soul on the central altar of the Aboriginal people. Send grass. This is the material of the time lighthouse wick and the last thing needed to build a time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that Richard is missing now is to ignite the fire of the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the established route, it should be time to go to the time lighthouse. From the map given by Italy and Russia, this time lighthouse has been built for more than half. Richard only needs to do a few small repairs, and then ignite the lights and lead the entire dawning place back to the order world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fire, when Richard approaches the lighthouse, he will naturally know where to look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally confirmed the route and took up his backpack and walked to the final destination in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, for a few days in a row, Richard suddenly felt a slight sway in his heart, and in the other direction seemed to have something particularly important. . He immediately turned around and followed his inner guidance, and ran in that direction, and even no longer worried about whether it would consume physical strength and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of uninterrupted travel, Richard has crossed tens of thousands of kilometers, and the physical strength and magic of storage have consumed more than half. But in front of him, there finally appeared a twisted node. This is a very hidden twisted node, and the fluctuations are abnormal. If it is not like a whim, Richard is hard to feel that there is a twisted node here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Richard is hard to find, and looking at the whole place of dawn, I am afraid no one can find it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly there were no indigenous people around this twisted node. When Richard eliminated the twisted nodes, a small village fell out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said to be a village. In fact, there are only three wooden houses and one well. Li looked at the well and found that there was still water in the bottom of the well. So he hit a bucket of water and drank a few mouthfuls and found that it was truly pure water. Richard continued to drink a few mouthfuls until he felt that he could fill the magic and looked at the bottom of the well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the surface of the water, it is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This well actually opened up the order world, able to extract energy from the order of the land, condensed into pure water. If it is in a dark area, there is no such thing as water naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the central wooden house, pushed the door in, and then grabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden house is very simple and should be a human settlement. There is only one wooden table inside, a cabinet with clothes and debris, and a pair of tables and chairs. The table was placed in front of the window with a quill and ink bottle on the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there is a familiar and familiar figure sitting in front of the window, constantly writing on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the sand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard never imagined that he would see sand flowing here! He was in a thrilled mood and hurried forward. He just reached out and saw the girl at the table insert the feather pen back into the ink bottle, stretched his body, and then the figure gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s hand stopped in the air for a long time, only to confirm that he just saw a phantom. But that is not like a phantom. Really, Richard has some points that are indistinguishable from reality and illusion. His eyes fell on the desk, where a letter was actually placed, and the ink was not dry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a long breath and went to the desk and sat down. Then pick up the stationery and read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"李察:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see this letter, it should be three thousand years later You may come, maybe not. I have long seen the fate of the trend, but still can not be sure. The power of fate is very powerful, but not immutable.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time lighthouse has been built and it is not difficult for you to ignite it. The fire is on the table and you are familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, I feel that I can say that I have done everything I can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s not my time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very short letter, but after reading it, Richard is too heavy to say. Especially the last sentence is like a huge stone. Unrelentingly squatting in Richard's heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finished reading, the letter was instantly turned into a little golden moment, and it dissipated at his fingertips. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter, written three thousand years ago, does not seem to have appeared at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li looked at the table, and at the corner of the desk, there was a thick book with a bronze cover. Richard was very familiar with it, and it was the book of time in the hands of the sand!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter when, Liusha never puts down the book of time. But now, the book of Time is quietly lying on the desk, but the sand is not seen. Even if you see the image when you come in, It’s just a reflection to Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat quietly for a moment, then reached for the book of time and turned it around. However, it was opened. In the past, no one except the quicksand could open the book of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li will settle down and turn the book over On the title page, I saw a sentence in the above handwriting: "The truth of the world is often the opposite of what we have seen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this sentence is temporarily difficult to understand, and Richard looks down. The lines of writing appear on the pages of the book, all of which are ways of using the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the book page no longer shows anything, and Richard only puts the book of time together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other commemorative thing in the room of the sand, and Richard went to the other two cabins. The two rooms should be the residences of Io and Nei, with their distinctive Breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard stood silent for a while, he left the small village and went to the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the last trace of sand flowing in the dawn. Soon the land of dawn will no longer exist, and Richard wants to make this small village together with the land of dawn, an eternal fragment of the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days, a magnificent tower appeared in front of Richard. Seeing this giant tower of hundreds of meters, Richard realized why the lighthouse was built and it would take a thousand years to drift sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark region, although people are immortal, they have no extraordinary power. The materials used to build the time lighthouse often need to be back from tens of thousands of kilometers, or even further. This magnificent tower is the sand and the three of them were gradually built with bricks. Every stone brick of the tower is made from stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee slowly stepped onto the time lighthouse. Every piece of masonry he saw, every decoration, was a sand drifting. They worked hard for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lamp room, there is already a huge copper brazier. But the base under the basin is still missing a corner. Richard took seven square blue stones from his backpack and filled it into the pedestal, which just happened to fill the corners. He took out his leather bag and poured the core black liquid into the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil-like core black liquor enters the brazier and immediately melts on its own, turning into a deep slick oil, and rolling itself on its own. When the bubbles burst, Richard seemed to hear a cries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard took out the soul and sent the grass, and the long grass like a reed was smashed into a wick and placed in a brazier. The black lamp oil immediately went up the wick and dyed it all black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a large number of colored bands suddenly appeared in the void above the time lighthouse, and the regular forces were surging, boiling, and even crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the light belt, there is a large blurry phantom flashing. Richard can see that the number of aborigines who are all dark areas is simply countless. They seem to want to rush into the time lighthouse, but they are blocked by an invisible barrier and have no ability to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these aborigines are still madly impacting the beacon of time, and there are more Aborigines in the distance who are coming quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
