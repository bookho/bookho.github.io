			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the curse, Richard knows nothing about Iskra, Originally, since there was a potion of inflammation, Richard wanted to ask if there was a potion that would make the soul of the beggar strong enough to escape from the curse, but Vatican directly broke the hope of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Green Forest, Richard let his followers and the knights assemble, and once again rushed to the Yongye tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, it doesn’t seem to be much different from the past. She is wrapped up all over the body, and the average person can’t see the difference, even her breath is enhanced. Some, while Richard feels that the scent of the scent begins to show looming volatility, which shows that she is already trying to suppress the power of the curse. It is difficult to control the spillover of power. This is not a good phenomenon. The days of support are few and far between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of the tree house, Richard’s heart was a little heavier, and he became more cheerful than the last time. Richard knew that she actually It is comforting myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked down the tree of life, very quiet along the way, the elves of the night never like to live in the village under the tree, most of the trees in the life It was a functional building such as an altar temple. When he passed a corner, Richard suddenly heard the vague quarrel. Richard had no psychological meeting, but he heard that one of them was Mei Lin, so he slowed down and slowly converges. Standing on the corner, Richard strengthened the perception, and the sound of the quarrel immediately became clear. The two sides were actually quarreling with an ancient encryption method. The elf opposite Mei Lin was laid around. The natural barrier of the layer, when the sound passes through the barrier, will be disturbed by natural forces and become the sound of the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this elf does not want his conversation with Melin to be known, but this little means can’t take effect in front of Richard, and Richard’s mind is moving. As soon as the natural forces extended out and merged into the natural barrier, the dialogue between the elf and Melin was immediately introduced into Richard's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meline, this is for the whole tribe." The elf was very excited, almost useless, he calmed down a little, slowed down In tone, said: "Sorry, I am dying, but the sky is so important, it is not only for the tribe, but also for you... and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Kao, what does this have to do with us." Melin's voice was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are already a daughter of the forest, and I am awakened to be the son of the forest. It is only the last step, I... my mind, you still don't understand." There was some trembling in Kao’s voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline still said coldly: "In this crisis, I have no interest in love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...well, but only if you can get close to the elders, get in touch with the sky, do you know its history?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meilin A glimpse, said: "You know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kao bit his teeth and said: "I know that our Yongye tribe came to Greenson before it was another One of the emperor empire, we are the rest of the elf empire, it is said that the predecessor of the Yongye tribe is a high elf called the Silver Moon Elves."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are the blood of the Silver Moon Elf." Mei Lin is unbelievable. Like the new elves, she is not familiar with the history that was deliberately concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, this is why our warriors of the night are far stronger than other tribes, why are the elves in our tribes who are the sons of the forest and the daughters of the forest? More, because the blood of the high elves in our body, our bloodlines, is far more noble and powerful than the guardian elves of this plane." Kao Yue said that the more excited, the eyes are blooming, the elves are born It is a bloodline theorist, and nothing is more fun than proving that his bloodline is noble and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline’s breathing is also a bit short: “We are descendants of the High Elf.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, you know, I found a box of old books in the corner of the tribe's library. It's all useless, but there is a book with some historical fragments of the past. The Silver Moon Elf is not only It was only a high elf, and it was the royal family of the Elf Wang Ting at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true that there was seven artifacts in the Elven Empire, and the sky of the sky is probably one of the seven artifacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lin feels a little suffocated: "You mean, the long elder's rifle is one of the artifacts of the ancient elf empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the seven artifacts are With the illustrations, I discovered that the warriors used by the elders are exactly the same as the ones in them, and even the names are the same. It is impossible to be so coincidental. In front of us, the elders certainly did not fully activate the full power of the sky." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline doesn’t know what she is thinking, she is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kao stepped forward and grabbed Merlin’s arms and said, “Stolen the sky, then we left here, we Two are the owners of the most powerful blood of the Yongye tribe, and with the sky of artifacts, there must be a day of revenge for the entire tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Melin looked straight at Cao and asked, "As we flee, what do the elders do, what do the brothers and sisters in the tribe do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elders are holding the blue sky and can't fight the curse. Other people in the tribe, we can't save them now. If you bring them, the end result is that we are caught together and become a tool for enemy breeding. You I like this fate. Anyway, I don’t like it. Otherwise, everyone will die together, but the Yongyue tribe will be finished. The death is the easiest thing, but if you live, you need real courage. The elders are all right. Is dying, she has no need for the sky." Kao said Vexation fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline thought for a moment, slowly broke free from Kao’s hand and said: "The sky is the love of the elders, she It is all right to want to deal with the sky, even if you want this artifact to accompany her to sleep, it should be, I will not move the elders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Kao didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin said: "I still want to stay and face the fate with the brothers and sisters in the tribe, not to mention the elders are gone, the Yongye tribe also Not necessarily dying, Richard promised, will help us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richard, the outsider, the human, he is an intruder, he, he It’s not an elf at all, you don’t want to be deceived by him. Human beings are always liar and gangsters.” Kao said with some anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lin shook her head. "No, Richard is not a liar. The elders also recognize him very much. You don't know, the elders have ever confessed. Once... If she is not there, if we can't keep the tree of life, we can find a way to break through. Go to Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is impossible, Richard is a human being, the elders can't help us, how can a human being resist the world? Many tribes under the tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richard is very powerful, he may have a way, at least, I am willing to believe him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kao looked at Melin and suddenly said, "Do you like him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin Sound Suddenly increased the octave: "How is it possible, enough, I think the conversation tonight can stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved the barrier and turned around Going, taking a few steps, Melin hesitated and said, "You have some truth in your words, I will stay, and you can leave."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Melin walked away quickly, and Kao stood in the same place for a moment before turning around and leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been standing in the shadows, waiting for them to go far before they go to their residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha lives in a delicate lodge under the tree, where the layout is full of high elf style, even a candlestick is very complex and beautiful. At first glance, I know that I have spent a lot of manual work. Under the candlelight, Richard is burying himself in a thick book, which is the record of the eternal dragon temple on the annihilation of the twelve devils, although Iscara is new. The thirteenth demon gods appear, but they all come from the annihilation plane, which directly reflects the rules of a certain level of the plane, so there must be similarities. Learn more about the twelve devils and face Iscara. It is always good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was studying hard, the door was suddenly knocked softly, and Li’s head did not lift his head and said, "Is it Mellin? Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline walked into the room, hesitated for a while, finally made up her mind and asked: "Is there a way to save the elders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha closed the book in his hand and smiled a bit and said, "You asked the worst question."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
