			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go!" Three-pointed to grab the table, screaming to the back go with. The table fluttered out under his enormous power, and the blunt edge also had a terrible cutting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretending hunters have changed their faces, and they have flashed the route of the desktop flying, and no one dares to pick them up. How terrifying the mad ogres are, it is clear to an experienced hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking killer is still close to the three-pointer, his action is skilled, is in the dead corner of the ogre, the wrist, a turn Take out a short knife and leave a terrible wound on the large, three-footed body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles around the wound are constantly squirming and seem to be trying to close the wound, but in vain, the blood blew like a note, like a barrel opened in the corner by a tabletop. . The powerful nature of the ogre itself can not even be temporarily stopped bleeding. It can be seen that the short knife has a strong tearing and bleeding effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed turn around, screaming a punch to the killer, the killer turned into a shadow, flashed his heavy blow, then the short knife again Out, it is cut on the back side of the three-pronged knee, where a slit of at least ten centimeters deep is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre snarls in pain, the tendon tissue of the right leg is destroyed, and suddenly unable to support the body, squatting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short-lived match, it can be seen that the high-ranking killer has at least fourteen, and the guy who pretends to pretend to be a hunter is above the eleventh level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral pale, and suddenly moved to want to escape alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously a premeditated murder in front of him. With his ability, he will die. But hesitation just passed away. He gnawed his teeth and began to chanting spells quickly. In this case, he could only use a few low-level spells. Whether it is a bard or a bower, it does not play a big role in indoor melee. But this is the only way he can help with a three-pointer. In the face of many high-level opponents, Oral himself knows that these three-level spells do not play much role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight also stood up, her posture of straight up was very strange and slow, as much as possible to reduce the area of ​​their attack. But her eyes looked at the owner of the pub. In her eyes as a normal person, it was just an old man with a panic on his face. But in its other pupil covered by the wafer, the man was braving a light flame, clearly ready to fight. And the temperament is thick and strong, at least there are thirteen levels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the tavern owner!" The twilight screamed. The sharp voice pierces everyone's ears like a needle, leaving all the killers' movements a stagnation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ogre was originally stunned by the remnants of alcohol and severe pain and maddening nerves, and immediately recovered for a moment. However, the twilight only made a scream, and a figure appeared quietly behind him. A thin triangular sword broke through the back, and its natural armor could not resist the sword front, in a sharp break. In the sound of the leather, the sword penetrates into the heart and goes straight into the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-point cooked again roaring, the skin quickly spreads blood, which is a sign of his violent state. The ogre's right arm swayed and swept the pub owner who was approaching. The tavern boss was shocked and stunned. The rush of the face was extremely embarrassing. There was an overwhelming power in the face. It was not enough to prevent the distance from being evaded. He had to suffocate his arms and arms crossed in front of him. This is a big hit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticking a few cracks, the pub boss smashed his arms and arms, the whole person was swept out by three-pointed, the body continually smashed through the two walls, far away from the pub! Although he actually has fourteen levels of vindictiveness, it is a killer after all, and he has been hard-working with the instinct of three-pointed ones. One face was seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disguised tavern owner, the three-pointer fits and slams into the wall, and the half is strong and tears like a cardboard. Then it picks up the broken wall and A lot of killers went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the wall with a bad wind, rushing to the head and rushing to the ground, flying powder and flying all over the sky, even the fifteenth-level killer does not dare Block its peak. All the killers have shunned, and a guy who responded a little slower was taken by the edge of the broken wall, and immediately snorted, the whole person lost his balance, flew out and slammed into the side wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the killer who is headed for the moment is on the ground, swimming like a lizard, and instantly hits a three-footed foot, the wide-blade knife is used as an axe. Cut heavily on the ogre's feet and smashed its two thick toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Three minutes of painful madness, the giant fist slammed down, directly on the ground to pull out a deep pit, just the wind Just a few of the pubs in the pub were too late to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the viper-like killer has already gone away, leaving a knife mark on the elbow of the three-pointer. This knife rushed, failed to break the arm bones, but slanted and pulled over, revealing red and white tissue, blood spatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the twilight body trembled, and the left arm swept back to the back. A killer behind him smirked, the right hand dagger pulled out, then pierced, then pulled out, and then pierced. His level is much higher than the ochre, so the twilight movements and resistance are very slow in his eyes, and there are flaws and gaps everywhere. After filling the two swords, he calmly extended his left hand and grasped the wrist of the twilight left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two rounds and he have already figured out the power of the twilight, so the hand is like a steel tongs. Under one grip, the killer has full grip. Broken twilight wrist. The twilight left hand fell in the master's grasp, and it was indeed impossible to enter, but the killer felt that he did not hold the wrist at all, but seemed to hold a blade. He used a lot of power. Under one grip, there was a tingling in the palm of his hand, and the wound had already seen the bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer ate a dark loss, and his heart was furious, and immediately slashed his sword and then stabbed him. However, suddenly a hurricane hit, a huge fist is zooming in on the field! The killer did not expect that the ogre, who had been hit hard by his companions, chose himself as the target of the attack. He only had time to block his arms with his arms and was kicked by three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" The ogre grabbed the twilight and threw it away from the hole in the wall. Then he reached out and grabbed Oral and threw the elf poet out. His movements were so violent that a small spell that Oral was preparing was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are more important to the owner, go! I will stop them!" Three-pointed screaming, blocking the gap in the pub wall with his huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the killer is sinking and slashing. Knife shadows like the wind, instantly opened a few deep bone wounds in front of the ogre chest. And the three-pointed and wielded fists did not hit him. The three-pointed and full-fledged trauma has severely hampered its actions. Now it is entirely instinctive to throw a punch in the air, just want to delay the time. How can you hit the fifteenth-level killer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer’s face is getting colder and colder, the knife is getting faster and faster, the huge ogre is almost opened by him, and the wounds are so bloody. Not too big, but still stand still, but the fists that are thrown out are a bit heavier, so that he can't even dare to rub. The ogre is indeed tenacious, but stubborn to this point, but never heard of it. The most damn thing is that the ogre will actually send away the weak companions first! Are they not synonymous with cruelty and stupidity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
