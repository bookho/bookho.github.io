			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of the water splashed gently, so obediently let the sand blow away . Sinclair added a lot of negative attributes, and the water flower just stood strong and stood there. As long as he breathed a sigh of relief, he would immediately fall to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial madness and obsession gradually subsided, receded, and calmed down from the huge horror of death threats, still extremely easy to kill ordinary warriors, let her I found that my injury was not as irreparable as I originally thought, and it is very possible to live at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair finally chose to retreat, she let an axe under Gangde, and then rushed to the edge of the castle wall, several soldiers along the road are silent When the interest rate fell, no one could see the way she shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before retreating, Richard stared at her deeply, it was a waveless, impurity-free look, clear and pure, but it made people I can't see anything from it. Somehow, when Richard looked at it like this, Sinclair suddenly felt an inexplicable chill in his heart, and even diluted the frustration of her frustration. She has experienced countless storms and knows that in some people, hatred and anger do not need to be expressed by roar and roar, but they will always exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finally rushing to the side of the city, Cinclair stopped and turned to the cross knife, staring at all the people on the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bears have already rushed to the city, are dealing with the gate and the guards that the city is not very effective, so she is ready to stay here, waiting for the bear When the knights climbed the wall, they could kill all the people in the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fang Dan and Shuihua have lost their fighting power and can no longer pose a threat. The martial arts that Richard had just shown was indeed unexpected, but after she calmed down, she could see that it was just a desperate attempt. She doesn't even have to fight against Richard any more, just hiding aside, and when Richard's ability to break out is over, he will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden cold voice from Richard: "Would you like to drag the time? Not so easy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard re-opened the book of bearing, and two black warriors stepped out of the fog, appearing around Sinclair. In the narrow ramp space between the castle's fire wall, the power of the black warrior, which is clumsy, powerful and fearless, is greatly enhanced. The two black warriors waved a heavy axe to Sinclair, and the heavy power made her stand up a bit harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another black warrior appeared, but this time it was summoned under the wall, just below Sinclair. This is the summoner of Sand, and the location is designated by Richard. As soon as the black warrior appeared, the two town bear knights who were planning to climb the wall had to fight it first. The black warrior with one enemy and two can't last long, but as long as it can get a little time, the Cinclair on the wall will be more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s hands don’t know when there’s another heart, although for her formerly, this is almost impossible to enter, but now it’s I swallowed it without hesitation. But this time she did not convert energy so smoothly, but coughed violently, black blood spurted out of her mouth, and the fragmented dark sacrifice on her chest continued to ooze black blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been town bear knights climbing up the castle, but they are faced with countless long shots and heavy axes, as well as offensive and defensive matches with the right fighters. The town bear knights are endless, and every heavy sway will take away a few lives, but again, they will have more wounds. The fine soldiers under the baron, Richard’s sealed knights, and barbarian warriors can all hurt the town bear knight. Every town bear knight is surrounded by countless weapons, can not hide, do not hide is not good at them. The bear knight who left the mount was almost lost in mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandru, hiding in the dark, is summoning the black warriors one by one. In the melee army, the 12th-level black warriors can fully exert their full power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha mobilized his troops against the town bear knights who climbed the castle, watching Sinclair fight to guard the passage on the wall. Although there are always soldiers who have been dug out of the heart to eat, but the injury has not recovered, but with the consumption of physical strength, it is still increasing, it seems that there is power influencing her recovery. Now that Sinclair is in the hard top, waiting for the two town bear knights below to get rid of the black warriors and climb the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha constantly scans the battlefield, clenches his teeth against the bursts of blood after the bursting of blood, and the low-level magic is cast out like water. , or weaken the warrior of the town bear knight, or add a gain spell to the warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battlefield is like a sophisticated and complex alchemy machine, moving in the direction he expected. Every town bear knight is a very fierce battlefield. Richard watched the Ogre brothers dragging a town bear knight from the castle wall and fell to the ground together. The injury from the heights was extremely heavy, and the town bear knight and the ogre could not climb for a while. The town bear knights wearing heavy steel shackles are obviously under pressure from their own weight, and more importantly, they do not have the horrible resilience of the ogre. Richard knew that in a few minutes, the two ogres would get up and re-enter the battle, and the town bear knight would become a pile of life-threatening flesh in the steel shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another battlefield, three barbarian warriors slashed into the body of the bear knight in three directions. More Shamin and male jazz soldiers handed out the stab guns from behind the barbarian, and poked another crack in the cracks of the bears of the town bear knight. The town bear knight has not known how many times he has been stabbed, but he still stands upright, roaring and wielding his fists, and stumbling the enemies around him. A sealed knight suddenly jumped out, and his hands were swept across the sword. A sword cut the neck of the bear bear knight! The town bear knight screamed, and when he was dying, he reached out and grabbed the legs of the Knight, and pulled away his tears. He even tore his volley into two halves, which slowly fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flows in every place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently, Richard’s sight suddenly swept through Sinclair, saw the black blood on her charming face, and the crushing of the chest. The black and red liquid, inexplicable feeling bursts of disgust. That is the abomination from the blood of the elves. It is not something that is ethereal, but the true opposition of the two extreme attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the spur of the black blood of Sinclair, Richard’s Silver Moon Elf bloodline became incredibly clear for the first time, and constantly trembled, it seems It is urging him to fight. Richard was slightly indulged, and his mind flashed through countless thoughts and then stayed in one of the seemingly unbelievable thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard measured the distance between him and Sinclair, and suddenly stepped forward, and a double-colored string moon appeared on his head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third string, the moon of azure, corresponds to the prayer in the elf sword, which is a skill equivalent to the healing power of the gods. The Swordsman or the Swordsman's designated target releases a powerful healing power, and the source of power is the Azure Moon. This is the first time that Richard’s successful release of the letter of faith, the blue moon of the moon spread around him, at the foot of the castle stone bricks, and even began to appear a piece of green, quickly growing moss . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil Girl didn’t realize what was happening at first, but for the extremely dangerous and sensitive sense of smell, she instinctively made an evasive action, her figure stunned. Light down, it will be hidden from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
