			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s heart trembled, barely nodded and said: “Can only see At a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people approached the magic box, and the girl touched the lid with trembling hands, although the box was engraved with a complicated magic array. But that function is mainly used to prevent the magic inside the box, the switch is very simple, the universal magic seal plus the unique key of the Archon family, the symbolic significance is greater than the meaning of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s blood is enough for her to unravel the magic lock, and the blue and red light from the inside of the box is floating out of the lid. People are fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic box, there is a piece of metal plate quietly engraved with a complicated pattern, a little bright light, flowing back and forth in the grain. It looks very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new generation of magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a structure with a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is still in shock, and suddenly the young man reaches out and grasps the magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing," The girl screamed and the new magical soul could not be touched. This is taboo and common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s eyes flashed through the greedy light, but his face was kept stunned and said: “I just want to touch it, what happened, hey, magic soul Why didn't you see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl slammed her feet and hurriedly cried out, saying: "The new magical soul can't be touched, it hasn't been with this yet. The frame is bound, and when you move it, it is integrated into your body and it is now part of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young man is shocked and loses his voice "So I am dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls angered: "How is it possible, it will only greatly enhance your soul, wisdom, or some aspect? Talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man immediately breathed a sigh of relief and said, "That's good, what are you so angry about, this is not a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl raised her voice: "But this The magical soul is not yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man turned his face and said: "But this is what we first saw, like this spiritual thing. I have always been a German, and then, I really didn't mean it, now I can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked at him slyly The anger on his face gradually softened. After a moment, he sighed and said, "I don't know. I have to find a way to take my brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the voice of Richard suddenly sounded in the warehouse: "How are you here, who let you in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls and young men turned back, Seeing that Richard was standing at the door of the warehouse, Richard was just standing freely, without any weapons in his hands, and his body was just a simple aristocratic uniform, and an illegal robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s eyes flashed, showing a bit of fierce killing, and then disappeared, but he heard of Richard’s many records, knowing Richard There is nothing in his hand, and he can solve hundreds of things like him, so he shows a panicked appearance, quietly clenching the girl's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s heart trembled, or step forward, barely screamed: “Brother.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard's gaze first fell on the opened magic box, and then stared at the girl's face, coldly asked: "Vinica, this is how it is."<br /><br />&nbsp ;[############################################################################################################ As for Richard, he stayed in the ectopic and extremal battlefields for so long, but he also went to the plane of high time flow rate, so now the physical age has reached seventeen, seventeen, twelve The raging fire commander is not too bad, but compared with the 18-year-old 黛 黛 , , , , 相比 相比 相比 相比 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Vinika, this sister, Richard has not been very concerned about it, because she is a good child in the children of Gordon, but not very hard, Her current grade is not worthy of her talent, so Richard’s greatest expectation for her is that she has reached the sanctuary in this life, and even if she is in the sanctuary, she is mostly not for strong combat, but only for In order to enter the sanctuary, life and youth can be extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s attitude towards Vinica is completely laissez-faire. Providing treatment as a child of a normal family, there is no preference for any favor. For example, this magic warehouse means that she has no right to enter, but she is not only present now. Here, there is an unidentified young man next to it. This magic warehouse mainly stores unfinished semi-finished products and some special magic materials. Although it is expensive, it is not very useful to others except Richard. If you can't find the builder as a buyer, even if the thief steals the things in the warehouse, there is nowhere to go. Therefore, Richard does not add too many magic restrictions to the warehouse, because it will only cause inconvenience to himself. And if the warehouse area is not a designated Archimonde member, or led by them, others will not be able to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Richard’s question, Vinica was pale and reluctantly said: “We...we just inadvertently came in and looked at this...this The box, just opened, you just came in, we are just curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and glanced at the young man and asked: "We Who is this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He...he is Lu Xi'an, a poet, and mine...my..." In the first half of the sentence, in the face of Richard's increasingly sharp eyes, Vinica's head is gradually lower, and the voice is getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the ancient and sacred companion system of Archimonde, the closer the relationship between Lucien and Venica, the faster he will die, Winika More Richard's killing and decisive decision, knowing that his brother, as long as his mind is wrong, will immediately kill Lu Xi'an, and will not care what kind of background he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucien..." Richard stared, his sharpness in his eyes gradually disappeared, calmly asking: "His name is Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calmer the Richard, the more uncomfortable Vinica is, the unspeakable chill rises from the bottom of my heart, and trembles: "No...not... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know what is in this box." Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica's teeth have begun to fight, knocking and squeaking, reluctantly said: "It should be...constructed, not finished yet..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien’s face has finally changed. He has been keenly aware that Vinica’s position in Richard’s mind is far less important than he expected, his face. If you are dead, you know that you can only pin all your hopes on Vinica, and hope that Richard will not discover the magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li asked: "The inside is an unfinished structure. There should be few people except me who can complete it. What are you doing it, really just curious?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica heard a glimpse of Richard's tone and nodded quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "You know that I hate people lying in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Richard raised his hand and waved a light blue magical radiance. The magical energy ignited several hidden magical arrays, and the illusion of Venica and Lucien appeared in the air. As soon as the girl and Lucien entered the magic warehouse, they hugged together and kissed. After that, the magic images were restored one by one. Except for no sound, after a while, the whole process of the incident was very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica and Lucien are in the same color, they did not expect to have such a magical array in the warehouse, Lucien wants to force out several times Finally, I knew that the faster he moved, the faster he would die, so he stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic image is over, but Richard is silent. After a while, he looks up at the ceiling and sighs, saying: "The original structure I have already produced a magical soul... I didn’t even think that now I’m going to the path of the Holy Builder to see that it’s going to be delayed for a while, and you said, what should I do?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the magical soul was absorbed by Lucien, Richard did not get angry, even the sound did not improve, but Venica was more and more afraid in her heart, and the trembling screamed: "Brother..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and stopped the words under Venica, saying indifferently: "Don't call my brother, if you really are my brother, You won't open the box, you should know what the magical soul means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard’s gaze finally fell on Lucien, saying: You are Lu Xi'an, you are not very afraid of me, should let me evaluate you, is daring or ignorant."<br /><br />&nbs P;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his right hand and looked at his hand, faintly said: "It’s a new generation of magical soul. In the entire Holy Alliance, no one can stop me from destroying. Your whole family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
