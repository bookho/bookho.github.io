			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha made a look to Io and Naiyou, so three people I left and let Zong Hu stay alone in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed Richard and came to a quiet open space. Richard stopped and turned to look at Io and Nye, and sighed and said: "You are not an ordinary dragon temple priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io and Nye looked at each other and Io shrugged and said, "Look, I will Say he will know, let you be careful, you just don't listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou said in a constant voice: "The morning and evening things, why should you It doesn’t make sense at all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But where are we from, can you tell him?" Io said ironically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we can't say that place at all, we can try to explain it." Naiyou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think the explanation will be useful?" Io sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Israel, you just because you are too smart, so you stopped at the 16th level." Naiyou said that Iowa and I began to ponder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou looked at Richard and said, "It doesn't matter where we come from, but what I can guarantee is that we will be absolutely loyal to the quicksand." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard the extra meaning in this sentence and nodded: "That means that you are not necessarily loyal to me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Naiyou said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not unacceptable, but you will not do anything that is detrimental to me in the dark by loyalty to the name of quicksand." I smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyun thought about it and said seriously: "This is indeed possible. When the fundamental interests of the quicksands conflict with you, we will definitely stand." In addition to this situation, if someone tries to create a confrontation between you and the quicksand, then it is not that they have real great wisdom to see the future trajectory, that they think they are smart but actually stupid. I personally think that the latter is mostly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to the Io, the face is blue and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "This is an acceptable reason, but since you have the possibility to do it yourself, then I can’t give you The same treatment of my followers will lower one level. This reduction mainly refers to the structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is fair." Nai You said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard left, Io said indignantly: "Who cares about your benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You really care, and now you care." Nai You said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible." Io is about to jump up, but he looks at Neiyu, wants to say something, but he just sighs and shakes his head to leave. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his room, sat in a comfortable position, and began to communicate with his mother's nest, but this time Richard's consciousness was first contacted. The brain then turns to the mother's nest, it seems that the mother's nest is moving to the depths of the turbulent land, and the distance between Richard and Licha is quite far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was transferred through the brain, the data of the mother's nest was transmitted after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised and delighted Richard was that the mother’s nest had basically completed the eighth-order evolution, and now it is in the stage of comprehensively digesting the known data, only When this stage is over, the mother's nest may open the door to the ninth order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the key to opening this door is now Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth-order mother's nest returns its own image, its shape has become larger than ever, and now it is only over 70 meters in length, high ten The meter, the twelve-meter-large behemoth, is much larger than the ordinary dragon. On the ventral side of the mother's nest, there is a golden pattern, and there are many holes in it, which are constantly stretched and look like Like a respiratory organ. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard looked at the body structure of the mother's nest, it was discovered that the golden patterns seemed to be weak areas. In fact, the high-strength fibrous tissue under the subcutaneous defense was more than other places. To be much thicker, the real role of the pores is to spray a deadly acid mist, and the true respiratory organs of the mother's nest are hidden in the carapace and breastplate, and it is a deceptive death trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother nest seems to pay great attention to its own defense. The newly added volume is almost used on the insects and fiber belts. The insects on the chest and back are nearly two meters thick, and the strength is no better than the human high-precision body plate. difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Richard’s estimate, humans still have no weapons to break the nest’s insects in one fell swoop, even if they are siege giants, and on the other hand Look, Lina's red dragon Carlo is also hard to get the current mother's nest, at least its minions can't break the defense of the hen's nest once, and long time the dragon burns the hen's nest to resist, It is still debatable, but the same red dragon Carlo may not be able to resist the strong acidity of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the huge hen’s flight speed becomes one hour and forty kilometers, and the distance that can be moved every day is correspondingly reduced, and Richard noticed that the structure of the female nest has changed again, as if it has been optimizing its structure according to the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original insect has a lot of intricate hollow pores inside, which can reduce the weight on the one hand, and disperse the force of the weapon that penetrates the insects on the other hand. Reducing the power of the attack, now, the nest of the insects has enabled a new arrangement of pores, more holes, but the defense is not reduced, in addition to many of the bones in the nest Out of a lot of metal, it is like a unique alloy rod, which supports the whole insect armor and greatly enhances the defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the new insects on the mother's nest, Richard knew that the insects could be applied to the new combat units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He skips the ontology data directly and jumps to the additional items that the combat unit can choose. Sure enough, in the defense system data, the third generation of insects is added. A option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third generation of insects is inferior to the current insects of the mother nest, although it has not reached the level of fine enchantment, it has reached an excellent level. And to achieve this defensive power, the thickness is only half of the ordinary plate armor is enough, the weight is only a quarter of the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of insect can attach to the combat unit and become a nail, and on the outside can add a layer of enchanted armor, so that the battle unit defense Force, it is so powerful that it has reached the standard of standard knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the addition of the third generation of insects to the combat unit also requires additional resources. If the insect armor is attached to the whole body, then the combat unit created each day will be reduced by one, and if the insect armor equivalent to the light armor is attached, Although the number of combat units created will not decrease, the corresponding resource consumption will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother’s nest has now raised the demand for metal consumption, but most of the lists currently listed for Richard are mostly mined locally in Faro. Metals, each of which can be found in the Dwarf Kingdom, can only be brought in from some of the rare metals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard already has several ideas for new arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the information on the mother's nest and continued to examine, the current divine reserve of the mother's nest has more than 50 units, Richard from the sacrifice After the two pieces of divine crystals were fed to the mother's nest, each of them was equivalent to 50 units of divinity. However, after deducting the divine nature required for the promotion of the eighth step of the mother's nest, Richard noticed that the total number of divinities was not right. About a dozen units of the gods disappeared, and I don’t know where to use them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei casually raised this question, the mother's nest seems to be silent, and it seems that there is a delay in sending messages to the brain. It only answers because it is because The structure of the body, so it led to the loss of divinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the mother's nest sent another piece of information about the use and consumption of the divine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this document, the mother's nest found that by using divinity, some projects that have been difficult to analyze can be made instantaneously, and the divinity is like a Wherever the omnipotent gems are placed, there will be miracles, and on the other hand, the divine nature can be merged into the soul, thus making the soul greatly enhanced, and even the simple divinity itself may be brought together and produce a soul-like One thing, if it is injected into the combat unit, the combat unit has its own thoughts and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the divine soul and the true natural soul are different, in the mother's nest, their functions are very similar, they are all Make the combat unit smarter and smarter, and you can self-learn and strengthen the combat skills, so that you can better adapt to the battlefield environment of the plane, so in the eyes of the nest, the two souls are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this information, the doubts in Richard’s mind have been resolved, but still feel that there seems to be something wrong, but there is doubt about where But it is not his current wisdom talent can solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
