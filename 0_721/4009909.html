As she slammed her strength, an arm with a length of more than ten meters and a three-meter thick black skin was dragged into the portal and thrown to the ground. This arm was extremely heavy, slamming, smashing a large piece of hard blue magic spar, and deeply stuck in the ground. At the break of the arm, the blood of the black ink is constantly flowing out. It is extremely corrosive. When it falls, it will arouse the toxic fog of the canopy. If it is not the magic stone, it has a strong anti-corrosion effect. A deep pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun finally jumped out of the portal and landed on his arm. With a wave of her hand, the blood oozing from the gap in the devil's arm floated under the influence of magic power, and gathered together into a ball, and it rolled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the blood of the devil, the legendary sighed and glanced at Gordon, and said very helplessly: "Do you want to be a little bit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s face was gloomy, but he shook his head and said, “This thing is not very useful to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The legendary Master immediately relieved and quickly threw the devil's blood into a hidden space and said, "You don't want it. Anyway, this thing is not worth any money! Hey, let the big guy run this time, I only cut my arm down, it is a big loss. I can't make up for the loss of the coordinates! Xiaogdun, you don't seem to get any good things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon took a deep breath and said: "It is a huge gain for me to be able to kill thousands of devils. And this time, as long as the devil lord can believe you, you can give him a bear. A profound lesson from the family! If they don't respond quickly enough, maybe it's possible to get rid of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; When it comes to Bear Peter, the legendary Master’s face is covered with a layer of frost, and said coldly: “These guys are so daring, they dare to move my little Richard! Oh! They thought I couldn’t Directly to the great aristocrats of the Holy Alliance, I dare to come to such a Hu! It seems that I have been busy making money in the past few years. There are not many time in the mainland, but many guys have forgotten the lessons of the year! My sister, though I am embarrassed to do it, But I can force others to start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! It’s not so easy to check out my little Li, it’s not so easy! It’s obvious that the devil is still Not enough, I still have several 'acquaintances' in the abyss! Little Gotton, the portal is over there, you bring people back, I will go to the abyss once, go to a few old guys!" The legendary Master said more and more anger, and finally even waved a small fist. Moreover, she ignored the fatigue and the fullness of the scars that had just been fought, and opened a temporary portal directly in the same place, and rushed in without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the portal that transmitted the flame and lava, Gordon’s face was very weird. Richard was lost in the turmoil of time, and Su Hailun’s reaction was much greater than his father’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deepest part of a layer of hell, stands a palace. The palace is hundreds of meters high and is cast from huge iron blocks with a dark coating on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These coatings are all secreted from the body by the elementary devil who is responsible for building the palace. It is spit on the iron block to ensure that the metal is not corroded by the air in the depths of hell. . After a long time, the coating will penetrate deep into the metal, thus making the metal corrosive and immune. These metals are precious in other planes, and they can sell for a small price. Materials that resist the erosion of hell are invincible in most of the plane environments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
