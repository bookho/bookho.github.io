Fight against the enemies of the violent wild boar. Now behind Richard, the only one who is holding him is sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was too late to say thank you, and the three fighters across the street rushed over to them! Perhaps it was discovered that Richard and the quicksand were both legal, and the rest of the knights were temporarily entangled. The three soldiers rushed straight at full speed. At this time, the Cavaliers were able to get rid of the enemy several times their own. In the twinkling of an eye, more soldiers crossed them and rushed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei gathered a little bit of magic and gave up immediately, and the residual magic was not even able to fire a fireball. The soldiers have approached the distance of the charge and can even see the red fog that tumbling in their pupils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between life and death, Richard’s face suddenly smeared with a strange red, his hair roots flying, stepping out, slamming up, colliding into the body The arms of a central soldier! This was a violent and solid collision. The slamming sound of the soldier immediately withdrew two steps, and a blood was full of Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of the 'explosion' of blood ability, Richard’s instantaneous power is no less than the tenth-level fighter, and his opponent is only a five-level fighter. Suddenly injured immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has taken off the machete in the hands of the soldiers, and suddenly a round of deep yellow moon appears on the top of the head. The amber moon is focused on the amazing flow rate. whole body. Then he held the machete flat, and turned it around in the same place. The same amber knife smacked a step of the ring, sweeping through the soldiers who crossed the sand and fluttered around him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the elf sword. The ring of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fighters are still sprinting at full speed. At first, the two steps are still not the same. When their blade will stab the sand, they suddenly squat, and then The station was unstable and it was planted on both sides. The amber halo cuts through, the arm is out of the body, and there are more deep bottomless cuts under the ribs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two warriors screamed in horror, desperately trying to hold the wound on the body, but the blood and the visceral pieces rushed from the wound. Out, it is not a hand that can be stopped. The violent struggle made the blood spurt out of the spring, and their cry quickly became weak and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second string of amber moon quietly disappeared, the long knife in the hands of Richard did not see some blood. He stood still with a knife, and the blade pointed to the ground, and he looked at the enemy standing a few meters away. Although the soldiers occupied an absolute advantage in number, no one dared to step forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the machete in his hand and suddenly appeared a beautiful and cruel smile, saying: "This thing seems to be a bit too sharp."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the soldiers immediately changed and they involuntarily retreated. Anyone, even a veteran, is afraid of a murderous man who can kill himself and use blood and torture for fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this time, the crackling sound suddenly appeared in the woods behind them, and then the smoke in the forest rose, and there were trees falling down. It seems that there is a huge The beast rushed all the way, and the momentum was much bigger than the violent wild boars! Suddenly, the two shooters flew out of the woods and then planted them on the ground, motionless, and the limbs twisted into strange angles. From the momentum of the air, they obviously do not appear voluntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several small trees on the outermost edge of the woods fell down, and the two ogre roared out of the fluttering leaves and dust. Each of them holds a broken trunk in their hands, and ignores what kind of occupation the enemy is facing, and what to prepare for it. As long as it is enough for the attack range, it is a trunk that squats! When they ran, they even kicked the bushes on the ground, and saw the unlucky roots of the plants and they danced in the air. The arrow rain that came on the front stopped, and the shooter’s line of sight was a mess. Don’t say aiming at the target. Even if it was launched indiscriminately, it would hit the branches and leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several arrows in the two ogres, but the thick skin and thick fat are natural armor, which is not affected by the small injury. Their actions. They neither looked at the surrounding environment nor the concept of teamwork, so they rushed directly into the front of the remnants. At the trunk, two or three soldiers were smashed, and a stepping knight of the Archimonde family was Wrestled there, if not hiding fast, I was almost flying together. The two ogres are the tiramisu and the three-pointed, but the tiramisu, who calls himself the Master, is also slamming the trunk, and there is no such thing as a half-mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Gangde also snarled and rushed out. He added a few new injuries to his body, but his enemy had already turned into a dead body from the blood stained on the trunk of his hand. After Gangde’s huge body, the water splashes like a ghost, and there is no sound in the barefoot, whether on the grass or on the dead branches. The ‘Nest Sleep Guide’ in her hand is pointing to the ground, and there is no blood on the blade, but there is no need to doubt its results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next four squares, the last dozen soldiers who survived the high jazz squad were instantly cut down, leaving only a few serious wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard still stood upright, scolding the ground, and even the smile on his face had not changed. The sand drifted quietly, reaching for a shot on Richard's back and whispering, "Hey! There are no enemies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Richard to fall down The sand was shocked and hurriedly reached for help, but could not hold his heavy body. When she saw that she was going to be brought down together, the white shadow flashed in front of her, and the water flower appeared on the right side, and she helped Richard with her. It turned out that after Richard's magical overdraft, he used the bloodline ability to break out, and then forcibly spurred the Elf secret sword, which was already the end of the powerful. When I finished the last sentence, I was close to losing consciousness. It was only with a strong will to support the body and not to fall, to shock the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and the water will put Richard on the ground, and the sand will raise his hand, ready to give Richard a magical energy. However, the hand just lifted up, but was held by Richard. He looked at the sand with some wrong eyes and said weakly: "There are a lot of people injured, I just have to take a break, don't waste my power on me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha deeply looked at Richard, did not insist, but stood up and went to the injured. This time she applied a treatment for minor injuries. If it is not a serious injury, it can be cured within two or three days under the influence of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is leaning against the water, but the breathing is getting more and more intense. The feeling of the magical overdraft is even more uncomfortable than expected. He just wants to sleep. But know that you must not lose consciousness at this time, otherwise the magic may be damaged. So I struggled and asked: "Is there anything refreshing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wine!" said Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirits!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres turned to Gangde and stared at him straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
