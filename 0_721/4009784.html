"Primary construction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are all, but not more. The transmission between the planes requires a lot of magic crystals, and a brand new bit. The plane of the plane is not stable. The stronger the magic items passing through the channel, the more it will affect the stability of the channel. If the space is turbulent, it will be troublesome. Because this time you are exploring a low-level plane, so the staff More important than magical equipment. Most magic crystal quotas are used for personnel transmission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon once again indulged, and solemnly said: "Kid, you have grown up, so there is one thing to tell you. It is said that you were holding when you were young. After an inspirational ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat of Richard slightly accelerated a few shots, and the instinct told him that the secret in the enlightenment ceremony could not be said to anyone. There is no reason, just an instinct. In particular, the true talents that have never been recorded in the sacred scriptures of the Moon are even more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Gordon did not wait for him to answer, but went on to say: "I heard that there were some accidents in that ceremony, so your future life will be Ordinary people are not the same. In the next few years, there will be sudden shadow creatures around you, they will appear at any time, the quantity and strength are uncertain. It is also very simple to deal with them, use your Arcane energy smashes them into slag, remembering that the effects of fire and ice are relatively poor." Gordon looked up and down Richard, it seems that for the first time a little regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you must always be alert and try your best to improve your strength. The first stop after your departure tomorrow will be the death of our Archimonde family. The training camp, where the training is carried out by the family of civilians and slaves, the potential children are selected, and the inferior is the best way to cultivate the strong. You can choose a person there as your soul guard. But the choice must be cautious. Because the soul contract has only one copy in my hand, it is the god of the Eternal Dragon Temple. Generally, I can only get this kind of thing from the Eternal Dragon Hall, so you don't want to have a second copy in a short time. After choosing the soul guard, I will go to the port of Mokfand and find the portlor, Mofan, and say that you are coming to pick the slave. He will arrange everything for you, where you can pick the most suitable warrior. The principle is fine, not more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, it seems a bit embarrassing Gordon asked: "Okay, boy, what do you want to me? Say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp; Richard seriously thought about it and finally shook his head and said, "When I am alive, come back and say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard is ready to leave, Gordon suddenly stopped him and said, "I almost forgot one thing! Archimonde's first principle! Before you go to other planes, you must choose your partner, at least one. And you have to hurry up this evening. Things are done for Laozi, and it is enough to hand over the baggage to the housekeeper. Come, who do you want to be a partner? Don't be shy, just one can! Anyway, yes, as a bystander, I have a good one. Do you want to listen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? Is it 黛?" Li asked, among the young people he has seen, Yumei has the most potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not that little girl! It is your cousin, Count Ai Li," said Gotton with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Richard almost cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the recent limelight of Archonton, the name of Ai Li婕 God of War has begun to spread within the Holy Alliance. And as the Earl of the Holy Alliance, the title and territory of Ai Li婕 are second only to the two Marquis of Gordon and Sauron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gordon relying on the powerful 13th Cavaliers to fight, Ai Li婕 can reflect the outstanding battlefield control ability and command talent. Even the Akmon family has a voice inside, and it is believed that Gordon will not be the opponent of Ai Lijun if he has the same military power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conspiracy incident of Fokker on the same day, Richard also met Ai Li, her beauty, red hair, scars, murderous and giant swords I was very impressed with Richard. This is a woman with a gust of wind and fire, but with a pair of cold eyes. If it is described by intuition, then she is a piece of ice wrapped in flames, but there is a thunder in the heart of the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this war-like woman can't get in touch with her partner anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a bit and said, "This...the count will never agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"She will agree! Because she can't find a better companion than you. If she doesn't agree, it's also very good. Just start the Presbyterian meeting and assign you directly to her! Anyway, now the elders I will be your son, I have the final say!" Gordon said with great certainty, but Richard always felt that there was always a conspiracy in the smile of Gordon at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up and let someone go down! Anyway, you have a plural choice. As for your cousin, you can put it back first because she has returned to the territory. It’s been said that she had just had a riot in the site she had just hit. Unfortunately, she would have been two days late!” Gotton said with some regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard instinctively feels that the ending associated with the Earl is likely to be a tragedy, and he is still tangled and contradictory, and it is difficult to accept immediately Kermond has such an inextricable connection. Although in fact he could not cut off relations with Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a moment, and suddenly he passed a figure in his heart, so he said without thinking: "Choose Cocoa, the next one will wait until I come back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cocoa?" Gordon stunned, apparently for him, this is an almost completely strange name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cocoa.Merry.Acmemond." Richard is one word. His calm expression made Gotton understand that this matter has no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon didn’t have too much entanglement in this matter, but looked at Richard deeply and said, “Kid, remember, wait for you to arrive. After the ectopic face, every decision you make is related to all those who follow you. It is life or death! So, when you make any decision, there is no room for impulsiveness! Butler!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quietly opened and the old butler came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon pointed to Richard and said, "Take this boy to that...well, cocoa. From now on, cocoa is him." The companion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper was slightly surprised, but immediately recovered calm and left with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
