			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the bleak time of many fires and asked: "Time The fire is fueled by these souls. I am now taking away my soul and it will not go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar pointed to the corner and said: "No, as long as we take more soul wood back, it is the real fuel that supports the fire of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are piles in the corner A few dark twisted woods are the strange and twisted dead woods that Richard saw on the wasteland. He did not expect that these soul woods could actually be used to support the burning of the fire of time. Then this should be regarded as a rare and valuable city. Treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, the things that contain the power of the soul that can burn the fire of time, can sell the price of the sky, just the wood of the corner, It is possible to exchange a top sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard found the town, he saw at least dozens of soul trees on the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Then I will pick up some soul woods back. I remember there is one here not far from here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You" old Bar mouth opened Zhang, and finally sighed and said: "I know which one, hey, I have long wanted to cut it back, but its location But beyond my ability, even if I cut it, there is absolutely no way to bring it back, but if it is you, then it should be no problem, hey, I am really old."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard and Old Bar came to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar suddenly asked: "Before you come here, you should already be a super strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha only smiled a little, did not answer, went straight out of the order of light curtains, disappeared into the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time flow rate in the dark area is erratic, and the old Bar is sitting at the town waiting, I don’t know how long it has passed, and finally I see a blurred figure in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at a soulwood bigger than his own body and steadily walked into the town. His physical strength has now recovered by half. With the support of energy, his strength has also increased. A few tons of soul wood has no feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar originally thought that Richard would cut a bundle of branches back, so he was already satisfied, but I did not expect that Richard actually gave the whole tree directly. Come back, such a big soul wood, enough for the fire of time in the town to burn for hundreds of years, even if it is no longer expanding the light curtain, it is enough to maintain the existence of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar didn’t know what to say, but he just took a lot of shots on Richard’s shoulder and said, “Go, go have a drink, I treat you.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in the pub, Richard and the old Bar each put three glasses of wine, and a large bowl of hot meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the two people were full of food and drink, and the old Barr was full of drunkenness, and Li said constantly to tell his heroic deeds, and even later To jump to the table and compare with Richard, the old Barr jumped hard and didn't jump to the table, but fell directly to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was crying and laughing, he had to drag him out of the table, but he heard the sound of thunder, and Old Barr had fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the old Barr to his room and placed it on a slate on the ground, that is the bed of the old Bar, the old Bar is so drunk, very It may be a few days of lethargy, so Richard did not wait for him to wake up, directly carrying his own knife, and went outside the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the line will go out of order, the woman suddenly chased it up and forced a jug and a pack of barbecue to Richard, these foods, in the dark The region means the magic and physical strength of the small half, which means double the chance of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not refuse, waved goodbye to the woman, left the order curtain, and took the same pace to the direction of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness is still the same, under the gray light, everything is so dead, but the silence is just the appearance here, the twisted rules are produced all the time. A role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, life is unwelcome, and the twisting rules will lead them to self-destruction and perish, while the world itself is unchanged. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Richard is deep in the wilderness, the more he has this sentiment. He is more and more curious, why in such a world, as life itself, there is no need to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a seemingly simple question, but the answer may contain the secrets of the bottom of the world. Richard has an intuition, when he completely resolves After all the twisting rules, you can see the true face of the world and see the truth hidden by the twisting rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soul wood comes on its head, passing by, and then drifting away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard knows that these seemingly horrible dead woods are actually the key material for igniting the fire of time and for people to survive in this strange world. The key to going down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of soul wood on the wasteland is not too small, a soul wood can supply a town for a hundred years, but not many people can be on the wasteland Cut down the soul wood and then return safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked away and suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wilderness, he left a long footprint, the distance is already a bit fuzzy, and will disappear after a while, but the footprint is Straight, this is also the result of Richard's analytical rules. If you change another person, even if it is old Barr, the footprints on the wasteland will be distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has set his mind and continues to move forward, and his mind is reading the memory of those who are redeemed, even if it is a chaotic and distorted memory. It is also a memory and a manifestation of the rules of the world. In this way, as time goes by, Richard goes farther and farther, and the analysis of the rules of the world is getting deeper and deeper. After two days, he analyzes it. After the eighth rule of perception, after another three days, the ninth rule was also resolved, then the tenth article, the eleventh article<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 14th twisting rule was analyzed, the memories of hundreds of new souls have all been read. Richard has a new understanding of the dark areas, and at the same time has a new doubt: why the world does not belong to Own creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer this question, Richard felt that he had to parse all the twisting rules before he could begin to touch the essence of the dark region, which was also mentioned in the dark regional travels provided by St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man who successfully returned from the dark area did not solve the secret from beginning to end, but he guessed that there should be a world in the dark. The unique life, finding them, the secret to unlocking the world itself is equivalent to finding the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped and looked at a soul wood not far away, and there were traces of felling on several branches of the tree. In the heart of Richard's heart, he waved his hand and sprinkled a piece of light. This is a tracking magic that can trace biological traces. Now it can be used in the dark areas by the degree of Richard's rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large spot of light falls around the soul wood, and a line of footprints gradually emerges, pointing to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this line of footprints, Richard did not surprise, but looked serious, he did not rush to move forward, but took off the hip flask and food bag, will The wine that has never been moved is eaten a little bit, and sits quietly. When all the meat is turned into physical strength and magic, and the magic inside the body has been fully replenished, it stands up and walks in the direction indicated by the footsteps. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the town made Richard understand that meeting other people in this world is not necessarily a good thing. On the contrary, most of the time it is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted rules seem to distort the humanity, and all creatures, whether or not they are homosexual, will have time to treat each other as food, and According to Lao Bar, there are super strong people in this city, and there may be more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two more days, the outline of the city appeared on the horizon. This is an unusually simple city with a wall that is just as tall as an adult. The man’s head is a little taller, and some places even use a sharp-edged stone to form a fence instead of a city wall. But this does not mean that the city’s defense is weak. For many so-called newcomers, the wall itself It is a dangerous action that is likely to lead to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was also surprised that he could harvest the soul wood two days away, indicating that there are many very powerful guys in the city, in the dark. In the region, it is a powerful performance to be able to accurately cut the knife to the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
