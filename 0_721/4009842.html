			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! Baron, we have been through numerous tortures! The loyalty of the god is beyond reproach!" The two captains were unbelievable, and they all screamed and even wanted to rush to the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of two beast-like knights, the Baron Fossa was frightened and stood up involuntarily, trying to hide behind the chair. Because the verdict was too sudden, most of the captains in the room felt completely unbelievable. They did not react from the shock, and no one reacted to stop the two mad captains. Only the baron's loyal guard captain rushed to the front of the owner in time, but was struck by two desperately sealed knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-level Baron of Fossa has long panicked, and I don’t know how to deal with it. Seeing that the two sealed knights will reach out, the courtroom Suddenly there was a loud and clear sound, which was the sound of the sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two captains’ eyes were touching the clothes of Fossa, but they suddenly flew out and flew into the crowd, knocking down a large crowd. People. When the wolverines climbed up, they found that they had been contaminated with large pieces of blood. The two captains who were sealed were unable to fall to the ground, and they could only continually roll the trumpet in pain, and the blood continued to flow from the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissa Gold just seemed to move a bit, but now he is leisurely putting the short sword he wore into the sheath, for fear that others can’t see it’s cold front. The same as the blade. It turned out that in the blink of an eye, he had already sent out a sword to cut off the hands and feet of the two sealed knights and abolished their ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dare to attack the lord, it should be hanged," Pelisa Gold said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the people in the Chamber’s eyes are on the Baron Fossa. Everyone knows the reputation of Pelisagin, and only Fossa can In the identity of the Pelisa Gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron of Fossa’s face was white and white, repeatedly hesitating and struggling, but the tingling tingling from time to time always reminded him that Pelisa Gold was not helpless. Defying. That sting is the murderousness from Pelisa Gold. Fossa really worried that if he angered the moody guy, would he directly kill everyone in the courtroom and then declare that they were all accomplices invading the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fosa finally gnashed his teeth and said: "The Baron Pelisa Gold is well said, colluding with the invasion of the devil, attacking the lord, and both of these charges are sufficient. They were hanged! Drag them out and hang them on the gallows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards dragged the two captains who were constantly cursing and screaming, Baron Fossa also re-sit back to his position. After some tossing down, he felt that his body was weak and he couldn't breathe. The chair under his ass was more like a fire, and he sat unsteadily. The eyes cast by the silent people have made his heart cold. Fossa knows that in his lifetime, I am afraid that no one will ever go to himself. The incompetent protection of the lord, for a nobleman, there is no more fate than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Pelisagin wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissagin smiled happily, approached Fossa and whispered: "Mr. Mintel has a good relationship with me when he is alive, and he is barely a friend. Since he died in the hands of the intruder, I have to do something for him. For a while, let his wife, sister and two daughters wait for me in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fossa nodded in no expression, and the movement was extremely stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Sir Mintel’s wife, sister and two older daughters were taken alone by the guards into a room at the corner of the castle. The guards outside the room are no longer the guards of Fossa, but the knights of Pelisaquin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai's two daughters are a fourteen, one twelve-year-old, because of youthful reasons, they are pretty. They had just passed the fright of the Chamber of Deputies, and there was a dim sum of things that looked at the room that was not like a prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door opened and Pelisa Gold came in. He stood at the door, slowly picking up his gloves and patrolling the women in the room. Mintai’s wife stepped forward and said with a surprise: “Dear Baron, have you saved us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngest daughter directly flutters In Pelican's arms, he shouted at his uncle. But she suddenly screamed and fled, covering her chest with her arms. She was pinched very painful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai’s wife and sister were all shocked and said: “Baron, you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Min Tai and Pelisa Jin are indeed good friends, have had a lot of contacts, at least once. And now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is constantly screaming and crying, but after a few loud beatings, it becomes a low sob Peaceful, but Pelisa Gold’s snoring and wheezing are getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knights outside the door stood tall, like two metal statues. Their cold eyes glanced at the dark, deep corridors, ready to drive away all those who dared to get closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forward base, Richard is carefully inserting a magic pin into the magic lock on Essien’s diary, and then typing in the needle magic. The magic lock suddenly lit up, and a blue flame emerged, and then completely dimmed. With a slamming sound, the lock bounces off on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a little, and was very satisfied with the research results he had spent some time. In the process of cracking this magic lock, he not only revisited some special The theory of the magic array, but also a clearer understanding of the magic level of the plane, in addition to seemingly grasped some subtle differences, next time he should be able to try to use the native material of this plane to make the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the diary are not many, only the most significant event Essien will record this such precious notes. The sacred official's font is vigorous and powerful, and it has a rich sacred atmosphere. In the diary, Essien recorded an incident in which a pastor was deceived by the devil when he first arrived at the temple. That was fifteen years ago, an old five-level priest secretly learned the taboo summons in order to save the life of a terminally ill daughter, and established an altar called the devil in his basement. But he had just traded his soul to the devil, and he was spotted by the temple and eventually sent to the gallows. The illegitimate daughter and her mother were also thrown into the black prison of the lord and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was an accident when trying to destroy the altar. The demon summoned by the old pastor was very powerful. Although its body could not pass through the summoning gate, it took two The little devil who is not weak is thrown over. In order to kill these two little devils, the Knights of the Temple paid a total of six knights. Essien was also bitten, but his power was strong enough to eventually dispel the power of the devil to erode the soul and avoid the passive fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the incident, Essien recorded his concerns. The little devil is only the most basic creature of the Hell plane. After being cast into this plane, under the suppression of the plane rules, it still makes the imperial Knights of the Temple pay a heavy price. If there is a way to connect hell to the local plane in the future, isn't that the disaster of the entire plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
