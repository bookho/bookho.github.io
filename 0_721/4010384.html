			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart is in a strong crisis, he knows that once caught up, There is no such thing as a good fortune. Fortunately, he and the white night have learned how to run, and can maintain the high speed while minimizing the consumption of physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the wind blowing in the face becomes hard and cold, and the screams of the mouse behind him are one after another. The distance has never been pulled away, and Richard tries to speed up. The speed, but the physical strength began to decline rapidly, the wound under the ribs was also intensely painful, he had to lower the speed again, which made the physical decline become acceptable, at this moment Richard vitality and the Hydra The resilience of the lizards began to play a role, quickly replenishing the physical strength that was constantly being consumed. Although Richard’s physical strength was still slowly declining, he could persist for several hours. The only prayer was not to encounter other Dax Sodas. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a big arc and began to rush to the sun, even though he was in the vast area around the sun. The number of Das people still exceeds the Noord strong, but after all, it is still the Noland control area, Richard is likely to encounter Dakosodas, and may also encounter Noland's strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scarred land, Richard and the six-headed mouse rushed all the way, all the way away. After a few hours, Richard finally found a bunch of messy rocks, walked in, sat down on a rock, and began to take a breath, as if he had been thrown. Fish ashore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse devil was finally smashed, and now Richard got a little breathing space. Fortunately, there was no Dak on the road. The Sodas, whether else can escape or come to say two, unfortunately, the precious materials collected by Richard are almost abandoned to alleviate the weight, even most of the magic materials he has prepared. Do not discard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been breathing for a long time before I feel better. He feels quite lucky. It seems that the battle of the rising sun has attracted many Daxos. The strong man of Das, this makes the surrounding area become so empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the wound under the ribs began to violently pain, so that Richard gently snorted, and he felt like he was burning like a fire. The countless dark wounds began to attack, and the pain caused by the magical cognac jumped out at this time. Richard leaned back against the rock and felt that every breath exhaled with bloody smell and sucked in. The air is like hiding a lot of knives, and his lungs are bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case in the fierce battlefield. It is possible to encounter dangers and traps all the time. The strongmen of Noland are constantly studying the Dakosodas. Similarly, the strongest of Daksodas are also Studying Noland, this is a war between the two main planes. The competition between the two sides is endurance and the ability to let the other party lose blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this war of scale, rushed for a hundred years, but idle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and touched his ribs. The pain in the touch made him bite his teeth. He put his hand in front of him. I saw that there was no blood on the palm of my hand. It was all white pulp and pus of necrotic tissue. The minions of the mouse were poisonous. The original physical condition was not afraid of poison, but now his body is almost on the verge of collapse. The degree of self-healing ability has been greatly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no longer possible to fight anymore, and then to meet any Dakso Das, Richard has no strength to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a rest for a while, and when he recovered a little, he struggled to climb up and ran to the direction of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, Richard finally saw the day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still running, but almost dragging his body onto the stairway leading to the gate of the sun, the hilltop far behind Li On the top, there are a few small black spots that are shaking. It’s the mouse and the devil who have been chasing after Richard. Now their number has changed from six to eleven, but it’s already the day. Under the city of the unsettled capital, the number of mouse devils did not dare to be so close to the sun and the capital, they screamed for a while, then they were unwilling to disperse, and then went to find the next victim, the rising sun The level of fighting at that level is without the scope for their participation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is not the ultimate grandeur, the road up the mountain is also desperate, Richard is gone, and then turned into a move, and finally It was crawling, his vision began to blur, the throat was sore and painful, and the wound under the ribs became numb. In the eyes of Richard, the day and night suddenly swayed and suddenly turned upside down. The world is darkened by a muffled sound from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, whether it is in the hands of Noland, the day is not the end, or the chaotic vortex controlled by Dakso Das, They are no longer the focus of the dusk, and the battles that have taken place in the two major fortress areas have become very rare. Only the two juniors who can't get on the table during the week are still active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the center of the twilight is the place where the rising sun is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising sun is not as grand as the day and night. In fact, it was originally built on a low hilltop. Jane Castle, it is not a local indigenous city, but a stronghold built by the Nolans strongmen. It is one of the first places where Noland has contacted and fought with Dakosodas. There are a few large seats in the indigenous city, but there are no dangers to keep. This hill, which is only a few hundred meters high, is the only highland within a thousand kilometers. It is also the only place where the land type can be used slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first contact between Noland and Dakosodas was unexpected. The first battle was lost, and both sides invested. A large number of follow-up troops launched a series of tragic tug-of-wars around the hill. Both sides suffered heavy losses. Until then, the strongmen of the two main planes realized that the other party was not an indigenous person in this position, nor was it a certain A sub-planet intruder that can be despised, but a main orbital army with the same strength and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rapid escalation of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, millions of troops are smothered on this land, and the strongest players in the war are as stars and fallen. Countless people, all kinds of blood infiltrated every inch of land here, the war alarmed the entire Noland, when the generation of Noland's strong, the emperor of the Millennium Empire, the famous Sun King, personally came to the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a noon sun, shining for a moment, Sun King led his famous escorts in the world, and hit the main army of Dakso Das, hit There were countless killers, forcing the Daksocks squadron to withdraw a thousand miles. Nolander controlled this vast land. The castle that the strongmen originally built on the hill was named the Rising Sun. The first place to remember this war and the Sun King's Wu Xun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear plane was damaged in the ongoing wars of Noland and Dakosodas, the entire plane lost its vitality, and the dusk land became The name of this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of the swaying, the rising sun was built into the military fortress, which was held by the Holy Alliance, and then the attack of Dakosodas came. The more fierce, Nolande gradually became at a disadvantage, and finally, during the reign of Philip's father, the rising sun was taken away by Dakso Das. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
