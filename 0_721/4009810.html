			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty warriors in the armor are led by three captains, Slowly approaching the forward base. The archers on the left and right arrows have been full of bows, and then a string of strings, there are two soldiers in the arrow fell to the ground, the arrow's castration is so fast that the sealed knight can not help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to send a few more teams? Or let the archers suppress the arrow tower?" suggested by a sealed knight around Mintai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintech shook his head and said, "No! This kind of shooting, the two guys will take off at most 20 arrows! And only two shooters, fast How many arrows can you shoot? Let them speed up the attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the urge of Mintai, the sealed knight attacked by the tower speeded up, with the soldiers behind him Rush to the base gate like a flood. The base wall of the base is not high for the Cavaliers. It can be easily climbed. If there is no special material in the middle of the thick wooden door, it can't stand the vindictive destruction. The only thing to worry about is the magic suppression from Richard's range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a very cruel task. The role of the three team forwards is to consume the magic of Richard. As long as the wizard loses the firepower of a ranged attack, the battle will become much easier. Judging from the short contact war in front, the level of the Master should be around 7-8, then he has the magic of two fireballs. Now it is to see who the courage will bless who can be in the two fireballs. Live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the striker’s rush into the magician’s range, Sir Mintel ordered again: “The fourth and fifth teams, holding the shield, attacking the left and right arrows!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two captains who led the two fighters to rush to the arrow tower. The archer in the lower tower had to turn the target to the two fighters. So Sir Mintel wished to see a fireball flying down the gate. The raging fire swallowed up a whole team of warriors and shrouded the two sealed knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rushing fire, Richard began to recite the curse again. Three seconds later, another fireball fell, and the landing point was almost the same as the previous one. At this time, the predecessor of the previous fireball technique has not faded. Some of the soldiers who have fallen to the west have fallen to the ground, and some can stand up and persist. However, after the second fireball exploded, even a sealed knight was seriously injured and no one could stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superimposed attack of the two fireballs caused the two blocked knights to be slightly injured and reimbursed and reimbursed the entire team of fighters. On the battlefield, the unrestricted magician is the meat grinder that will move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! Several sharp arrows screamed at Richard, the shooters were almost red-eyed, and they all took out their strongest arrow skills to attack, even though they knew that at this distance, the ordinary arrows without enchantment were almost useless. Sure enough, the stepping knights around Richard took a step forward, and the tower shield landed, protecting himself and Richard behind the shield. In the sound of Ding Ding, the arrows hit the tower shield and were bounced off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More warriors began to appear on the wall, and Richard left the wall under the cover of the heavy shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s attack is suspended, meaning melee begins! Mintel finally waited for the opportunity of hope, and the big hand suddenly waved forward and said: "The sixth to tenth teams, come with me, all the offense! Hu Bo, you lead the eleventh to fifteenth teams, as the first The second echelon attacked. The rest of the people stayed in the field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of elite warriors shouted the war to follow Sir Mintel forward, and the sporadic arrows in the base of the archers could not stop the rushing army. Up to ten blocked knights attacked at the same time, and two jazz! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-meter-high wall is not an obstacle to the Knights. When Sir Mintel rushed to the wall, he jumped up and half-emptied. The lieutenant slammed into the city wall and threw a sinking pit on the wall! With this power, Mintai has jumped on the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry, a double-edged heavy axe suddenly appeared, and the waist came to Min Tai! The jazz is still in the air, then screaming, picking up the two-handed epee, smashing and smashing the axe! Two heavy weapons collided under the vindictive blessing and made a thunderous impact. The sturdy man who was even more sturdy than Sir Mintel on the wall took a step back, and there was a trace of blood in his mouth. Mintel’s plan to get on the wall was blocked. He cursed and was thrown back by the force of the rebound. Heavy fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also uncomfortable to drop from a height of more than four meters. He struggled several times before he climbed up. Unfortunately, the two fighters in his shackles have long since returned to the Kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode does not prevent most of Mintel’s army from flooding the wall. There is already a sealed knight and several fighters on the wall. Archimonde's home-running knights rushed out of the tower. They held a shield and held a single-handed axe to the crowd. Melee killing is the specialty of these stepping knights, and they are all elites of the Archimonde family. The sealed knights of the same rank are not their opponents at all. The ordinary soldiers who climbed the wall are even more axe. The two rifle knights immediately smashed the enemy's formation from the flank's brute force attack. A sealed knight's entire arm was cut off, screaming and falling from the wall, and the soldier's body was continuously thrown from the wall. drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove first!" Mintel’s screams rang again, and the already confusing warriors retraced, but the invaders on the walls seemed unable to chase . Mintel’s archers shot two rounds to cover the retreat, and the stepping knights retreated into the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A siege war, Mintai lost more than 20 soldiers, three were severely wounded by the Cavaliers, lost their fighting power. The third-level priest is busy throwing his extremely limited magical treatments into a few slightly wounded knights. The god of the 20-year-old is obviously not deep enough. The effect of treating minor injuries is almost indistinguishable from the naked eye, and only some hemostasis can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soldiers rested, Mintel looked at the base not far away, smirked and said: "They have only six knights of the knight level, and An archer who looks like a lady, it seems to be this person. The magician should only have 8 levels, there is no magic, so let the soldiers rest for a while! The magician's magic recovery is in days. To calculate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hub Sir nodded and said with a consistent sigh of relief: "The next attack will be able to knock this place down. However, If the intruder has only this strength, the high should not fail. Where did the guy go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is he going! Now we Let’s talk about it here first!” Mintel was a bit violent when he mentioned Gao, and he reached out to the direction of the base. He said, “This is the place in the gods anyway! Take it is the front The most important thing, of course, if you can find the body of Gao’s in the cell inside, then it’s wonderful. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hu Bo shrugged and did not continue on this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
