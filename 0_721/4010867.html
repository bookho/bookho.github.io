			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss lord is even more angry: "You dirty reptiles I dare to destroy my palace. I will put you all into the melting pot of the abyss, so that you can be washed for 10,000 years by the melt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bursts The buzzing sound began, and the hall began to vibrate violently. From time to time, fine stones fell from the top of the temple. The huge spiritual pressure came from all directions. It shocked the hearts of the people. Several knights were pale and almost occupied by fear. The mind, ready to go around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Clark and Achilles look very unnatural, this is a spiritual frontal collision, the soul power is matched, they are on the magic Extraordinary skills are useless here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when Richard looks as usual, the power of the legendary level finally shows its effect in line with its level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and said faintly: "An abyss lord, the exact statement, should be the abyss lord, whether it is true or not, even if you are true It’s a small lord who came here, and there’s nothing to be arrogant.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your gods are going to squat in front of me.” The roar is more intense, and the spirit of power is like a sea wave, and I want to push Richard to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, but that is not my god, my patience is limited, this game ends here." Said, Richard raised his right hand, in his hand Flashing a little blue star, like a small starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the movement of Richard, there are many blue sparks in the hall, they are like an elf, burning quietly, flying, every A blue spark corresponds to a spark in the sky in the hands of Richard, and the flight path and the light and dark rhythm are exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossoming blue sparks drifted into the ubiquitous dense fog in the hall, and when they touched the fog, they suddenly burned fiercely, ejecting bright flames, those mists It was rolled up like a puff, and then it was ignited, making the blue fire burn more violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil suddenly screamed in pain: "These flames, how can these flames burn the soul, ah, why do you have such a flame, who are you? Who are you,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call of the devil's stern resounding through the hall, has always oppressed the spirit of the crowd and instantly became empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the devil’s call, Richard sneered and said, “My name is Richard Akmond. If you want, you can go back to the abyss. I cursed me with great curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky in the hands of Richard quickly became bigger, and every little spark on his hand, a flying blue would be added to the hall. There are hundreds of blue fires flying in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's screams instantly increased several scales, and it suddenly shouted: "I will come back." Then the powerful consciousness faded like a tide. It disappeared in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change suddenly came, and even Richard couldn’t think that the demon lord, who had just been arrogant, actually ran and ran, letting his idea of ​​capturing the refining soul fall into the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the consciousness of the demon lord disappears, the fog in the hall is dispersed, and the fog is actually the spiritual power of the demon lord, and it can also exert pressure. Richard saw this through, so he released a large blue fire to burn the mist, in order to refine the soul of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the demon lord has already ran, Richard will make a fist in his right hand, and all the blue fires will fly back, falling into his palm and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glanced at the entire hall, Richard finally turned his head and said, "It’s really fast to run."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took a wave, and the knight and the Frost Warrior spread out and carefully explored the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is extremely grand and much wider than the hall above. It is like a naturally formed space, very empty and almost no decoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the main hall, there is a high platform and a throne built by black iron. The two armrests of the huge throne are built to face the succubus standing on the outside. It is the typical style of the throne of the Lord in the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fog is gone, the high platform and the throne show the true size. The devil who sits on this throne must be at least 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abyss and hell, the devil's size often represents the strength of the devil, like this demon more than a hundred meters, enough to compare with the Titan body, even if the abyss is not the master of the layer, the power will not be smaller than the big lord More, at least as far as Richard knows, no demon lord can sit on this black iron throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it just that the devil is not bragging, but really a big lord, Achilles turned his head and looked over, knowing the dark gods of the deep world knowledge Obviously it was also shocked by the Black Iron Throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think that the demon was really a big lord, otherwise it would not be burnt away by a few blue fires, although the other party could easily get rid of it. A blue fire that can stick to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha floated on the high platform and flew around the throne. After careful inspection, he did not find anything of value, perhaps the most The value is the material and carving skills of the throne itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the throne, it is a deep gateway, with faint fluctuations in space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the aid of real vision, Richard quickly confirmed that it was a short-range portal in the plane and was very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the portal, Richard found himself in a strange space, where the smell of sulfur and flame was everywhere, and the air was faintly faint. The light comes from the spot on the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard penetrated the smoke and scanned the surroundings. This is a naturally formed underground space, very huge, and has some taste of the underground world. Hundreds of meters, full of unknown bacteria clusters, it is their radiant light that illuminates the underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s gaze was suddenly attracted by two distant waterfalls. The two waterfalls actually flowed out of the air and landed on the ground, gathering together into a small river. Flowing to a small hill in the distance, the other end of the hill is faintly glowing, and from time to time there is a smoky yellow smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waterfall exudes a strange atmosphere and poses quite attractive to Richard. He immediately flies to the edge of the waterfall and examines it carefully, which makes him surprised and happy. These two waterfalls contain extremely abundant energy. It is no exaggeration to say that just take a bottle of water and a bottle of high-grade magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two waterfalls that don't seem to be big, but they are actually waterfalls that run through magic potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waterfall is emerging from the void, and Richard carefully scanned the surrounding space and finally determined that it was captured by the extremely large energy-absorbing array in the ground. The power of the planes has gathered here and turned into two waterfalls in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small river shines with soft light, all the way to the distance, just like the magic pool in the half-face of Richard, the river bottom of this small river actually has The magic crystal of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river bypassed the hills of tens of meters high and eventually merged into a pool of water. Richard flew up the hills and looked up, but suddenly saw the front lying An incomparably huge demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to look carefully, just by the more than 100 meters of the body of the body, Richard can conclude that this must be a demon lord, and Richard can’t think about it. The instinctive fear drove him to flash back a hundred meters in an instant. This distance is still unsafe. When the demon lord stands up, it is possible to shoot Richard without an unconscious waving arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lord is the topmost existence of the abyss, each name is enough to tremble the entire abyss, many large lords rule the entire abyss alone, and Some abyss that are extraordinarily vast or whose energy and resources are extremely rich are divided by several big lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is as strong as Su Helun, it is impossible to challenge a demon lord in the abyss, and Richard sees a demon lord, the first instinct is to escape, how many How far to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flashback, Richard realized that the demon lord did not move, still lying still, if he was normal, at least should stand at this time Get up, then either breathe, curse, or use other powerful skills to directly smash Richard into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha heard a huge heartbeat. At such a close distance, he finally confirmed that the sound came from the big demon lord in front of him. However, Richard always felt that the heartbeat was somewhat unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resonance of this heartbeat did not bring discomfort to Richard, but there was a temptation to attract him to explore the past, and the subconscious kept telling him. Being close will not in danger of hurting your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
