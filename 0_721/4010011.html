			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard construction of the initial power is not the most difficult for the current Richard Even if it is in the state of magical emptiness, it can be drawn, but the margin is slightly lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pose is prepared for the ogre, which can greatly enhance its combat effectiveness. The magic pattern is not only applicable to humans, but also to the intelligent races of elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc., and only minor adjustments are needed. Even some of the powerful World of Warcraft can load the magical structure, such as the mount of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, throughout the history of mankind, there are very few custom-made structures for ogres and barbarians, even if there are few initial structures. In the early days of the development of the magical pattern, humans and higher elves constituted the main body of the architect. However, after the decline of the elf empire, the human race occupied the vast majority of all the architects. The status of each of the architects is very respectful, and the fabrics they produce are always in short supply, regardless of their quality. Who else will make an ogre, a barbarian, a thing that is only one line apart from Warcraft in the eyes of human beings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ogre can carry the structure. They are different from orcs, and many ogres still have magical talents, such as tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial power of Richard is to be used for three-points, although it is a standard version and not a non-standard package tailored specifically for the ogre. However, with the vitality of three-pointed and powerful, it feels a little discomfort at the time of launching, but the combat effectiveness can be greatly improved. If it is changed to a non-standard installation, then the cost will be multiplied several times, and it will take three months for Richard to remove the benefits of comfort. The increase in power bonus is only 5%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial power is now nearing completion, as long as there are two more nights to make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Water Oasis has passed another day in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, people talk a lot more, mainly the nearly 8,000 slaves that Richard suddenly brought back the previous day. Although the sand people occupied a large head, Richard also left the high-priced elite barbarians and wild elves, but the remaining slaves were also worth 50,000 gold coins, which is still the price of the blood-stained land. In the eyes of anyone, 50,000 gold coins are not a small business, so people naturally talk about it and talk non-stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as night falls, there is another topic in the city, that is, a dozen people who suddenly appear on the edge of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are humans and dwarves, all of which are all cut off from the limbs, but they have been treated by the magic. The wounds of the residual limbs are no longer bleeding in large areas, at least I can't die in a few days. They screamed and screamed, so that the residents who were used to bloody and brutal blood were also discolored. Some people have recognized that several human beings are red Cossacks, but no one dares to help them alleviate the pain, and even end the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early someone recognized that these people were thrown away by Richard’s men, and now this young and handsome big magician has actually been with the devil in people’s eyes. different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night when Richard robbed the caravan to the Blue Water Oasis, the agent of the Red Cossack in the Blue Water Oasis City quietly left to avoid Richard. The edge. But no one would think that the fierce behemoth had retreated in front of Richard. It was just that the local agent felt that the power at hand was not enough to deal with Richard. The strength of the red Cossacks that started with the horse was in the wilderness. They were very Less in the city to display heavy soldiers. Next, the red Cossack will definitely be a fierce counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction between Richard and the red Cossack has reached an endless end, and from the perspective of a series of incidents, Richard’s performance is as good as the red Cossack. The blood can't scare the red Cossack, but it effectively stops some guys who are looking young and ready to make some bad ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers are naturally arguing, but they consciously and unconsciously depressed the voice. This is the embodiment of Richard’s power today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another night, Richard is doing the finishing touches of the power building, and the sanding is a routine evening class for the three pastors, telling about the power of the gods. Cumulative and usage methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water flower is still hidden in the dark, except for Richard, no one can accurately grasp her position, while the twilight is occasionally lingering around her, sometimes in the city Wandering in the middle. Gangde and Tiramisu stayed with the troops. After adding 100 barbarians and 60 wild elf archers, they need to train them as soon as possible so that they can form a battle. Everyone else has its own affairs, and Richard has to stay in the Blue Water Oasis for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark has heard the news, he successfully absorbed the power of the gods, and the troops directly under his command are coming, and there are three hundred soldiers in the gun He accepted the employment of Richard and will only come when the task is completed. Although it is necessary to pay an additional 3,000 gold coins per month for the Demon Gun, but all the elites above the seventh level, two are also powerful swordsmen of the thirteenth level, so that Richard's gold coins are very worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, I just need to wait for the Falun Kao, the sanctuary of Jinhui’s flag, to come, so that I won’t be afraid of the strong Cossack’s strong attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of Luofu is already in production. This is a costly construction that lasts for half an hour and can be increased every time. 20% power and 10% defense. The combination of the two effects is also a sign of the second-order construction. Using this structure twice will burn most of the magical array, leaving only a chicken-like effect. But its most important ideas and places that increase costs are the magical array of self-destruction. If it's just a standard second-order warrior, the cost of production is reduced by a third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pub on the edge of the city, trio, Oral and Twilight are drinking around the table. They chose this mainly because of the ogre. Tripartite is an unpopular role in most pubs because it scares other guests away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the soul contract with Richard, Oral has been irritated recently, so he took three points to get out and drink. Twilight did not know why, he followed, but tonight Oral did not mourn, but eager to use his alcohol to wash his throat and suppress the incitement from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight is still wrapped in a dark burq, so as not to cause too much attention to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business in the pub is very light, with only two tables. But the ogre is already throwing a bottle around the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre owns at least seven or eight strong men, and its huge body can’t even be stuffed into a chair, but sits directly on the ground. This is also the same as the sitting Oral. Elf poets have been stalked in the upper class, and the amount of alcohol is a must. The twilight does not show weakness, and alcohol does not seem to respond to it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Third. Deleted again because of the previous misoperation. Slightly a little bit of the perverts who are worthy of voting and the shreds of shreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
