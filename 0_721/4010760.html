			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You" Raymond’s sudden change gradually, he seems to want to say What, but the blood bubble constantly rushes out of his mouth, and can't spit out a complete syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reya’s face is pale, she wants to pounce on it, but she seems to have concerns, just standing on the ground and shaking, she bit her hand to make herself Do not cry out, the right hand involuntarily put on the lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looked at Raymond’s eyes, the pupils had begun to slowly lose focus, but still calm, calm and almost cold, seemingly even his own life The end point is not worth moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly pointed out the blue Mars that popped a little nail size, accurately shot into Lei Ya’s lower abdomen, which was extremely overbearing, and then burned through the thunder. Ya's body, revealed from behind, and then did not enter the wall, do not know how much deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leia exclaimed, looking down at her abdomen, her face became pale in an instant, in the middle of her abdomen, leaving a hole in the thickness of her fingers. The wound has already crystallized. For a strong sanctuary, the injury is not too heavy, but the location of the wound makes her want to scream, and she can no longer scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee turned a deaf ear and still looked at Raymond and said slowly: "The child in Lei Ya’s stomach has been a month, if I guess it is correct, It is not your child, but your own, your soul and memory have been quietly transferred, so even if I finally choose to kill you, you can still exist, but unfortunately, the embryo has now been I destroyed it, using the moon power of the blue moon, so you can die with peace of mind. In this world, there is no Raymond ever since."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Raymond’s face was really stunned. Staring at Richard’s gaze was full of inquiry, and Richard finally whispered in his ear: “It’s not only the scholar’s ​​mage who can see the truth of the world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond’s eyes passed, and his eyes finally closed slowly. Richard released his hand and let Raymond’s body fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the body that Raymond has completely lost his vitality, Richard’s heart doesn’t know what it’s like, from the time he set foot on Faustism until now, in Richard In seven or eight years, in Raymond, it was fifteen years. Two people have been fighting for infighting. The battle has only come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard was somewhat awkward and lost a weighty opponent. In a sense, it was equivalent to the absence of a confidant. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I do not know how long, just look to Leiya Richard, said: "I have called the priest over, it does not matter your wounds, rest a few days it can be a good "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Leiya in said Richard Raymond final layout break when he stopped all reactions, fell to the ground, she did not cry either, There was no trouble, just holding my abdomen and looking at the floor dumbly. In fact, a long time ago, when I first traded with Richard, I felt that I would eventually come to an end in today’s way. Richard is not able to Tolerate the betrayal of men, and Raymond never really bends before the defeat. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; until now, she knew intra-abdominal fetus turns out to be another Raymond, Raymond also know that Richard can not leave, but for her, Who is the same in the belly, it is her child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and walked out of the room. After a moment, he took him to the sky and flew at the full speed in the direction of Lanshui Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several priests walked into the room and began to examine the wounds and treat them, and Leia sat in a dull manner, letting them run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving Faro, Richard still had a strong loss, just like what was missing in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally killed Raymond, this result is beyond Raymond’s surprise, but it is in Richard’s sense, in the heart of Richard’s heart, the interest It is not a decisive factor, at least not in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing of Raymond is tantamount to cutting off a line between the scholars of Solomon and the Master of Scholars. Originally, Richard hoped that in the long years, Through Raymond this line gradually find out the details of the mysterious Solomon Castle scholar mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although getting the magic feather in Calondo, Solomon seems to be showing goodwill to him, and his war with Raymond seems to be only two The private grievances between the families, but Richard has an instinctive alert to this mysterious and powerful organization. However, after so many years, Raymond not only did not leak the water, but instead used the soul to complete the plan, which almost shaken the foundation of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least not all gains, Richard finally realized that the scholars are a group of madmen who have no feelings and affection. They are paranoid toward their own goals, have no scruples, use whatever means, and are not subject to any suspicion. Raymond will scrutinize the blood of the Joseph family, and will also consider Lei Ya, but when the dagger is pierced into the heart of Raymond, Richard finally admitted in this way that he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many years, if you don’t think about the soul-filling plan, Raymond’s actions are very satisfying to Richard, whether it’s behind the scenes. Anrekala, the planning municipality that manages the entire Oasis City, and the logistics system now planned for Richard, all reflect a very high standard, and even in some respects, even Richard is sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting Raymond on the whole building of Faro, just like Richard’s own command here, it should be said that the effect is better. After all, Raymond already had I have a wealth of experience in operating the Joseph family, and from a lord's point of view, there is really no better candidate than a scholar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so many years, among so many enemies, only Raymond had almost killed Richard twice, and he even trapped Gordon’s army. Qi's plane, the specific means used, until now is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Raymond is not a scholar's mage, then it's better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and changed Shangzhuang’s heavy and majestic expression greeted the Arkanmond family guards who arrived. Richard handed over a number of already written letters to the old butler, and immediately sent him to the designated person’s hand, and then let People made a special trip to Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Nyris arrived at the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the retreat of Richard, he carefully looked at the four emperors who looked obviously, and said after a while: "You are thin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the day is like a year, how can it not be thin?" Neris said with a wry smile, he hesitated for a moment, suddenly a broken can of a broken look, said: "Li Cha, I am ready and Meek is getting married, I am"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mex, wait a minute." Richard stood up and took a copy from the next shelf. The contemporary aristocratic genealogy of the mainland turned over and looked at one of the pages. He said, "I said how to feel that the name is familiar. It turned out that she is the granddaughter of the Garan emperor, and also the famous beauty and young strongman of the millennial dynasty. It is Prince of Tumen, oh, the status of the Millennium dynasty is similar to that of the Iron Man. So, her identity background is not lower than you, especially at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Richard looked up and smiled and said: "There is nothing wrong with this marriage contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s face suddenly changed, and he said: You, but I don't want this woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and asked, "Do you have such a special reason to hate her?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris wants to stop, suddenly sighs and says, "I just don't like her, can this reason be?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been indulging for a moment. For political marriage, it is too rash to like or dislike. However, Richard nodded and said, "Yes, but I have heard that you are now The situation is not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go deeper, but his meaning is already clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of time, there is no idleness, but the people of the royal family are constantly being cleaned up. She especially hates the harem of Philip, and has already made excuses. Three high-ranking emperors have been killed in succession, and their children and even their families are collectively silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero has now gone to the exclusive position of the royal family to develop resources, and Ryan has joined the Eternal Dragon Hall to become a priest, initially showing talent, God The skill level has increased rapidly. The two former candidates have contributed in their own way. They are also in disguise and self-protection. Only then, Nyris seems to be doing nothing and staying in the Imperial Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a prince, Nyris’s marriage is part of politics. If it is not normal, Nyris should know this, and Meek It is said that it is also a beautiful woman. From the conditional point of view, this marriage is indeed quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Mex’s huge background can also protect the mother of Nyris, no matter how crazy, no way just to find Nyris was in trouble and was the enemy of the Garan emperor. This is what Nyris needs most now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nyris always lowered his head and never lifted it up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of a possibility, so he tentatively asked: "You have someone you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
