			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know the market price outside of the dark blue, even if he knew it would not care. Now he is excited about the 30,000 gold coins he received, because this is the first money earned by his own strength. Although compared to the resources he has consumed so far, tens of thousands of gold coins are completely negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only excited for a few minutes for extra income, and he was involved in never-ending work and study. Black gold is wearing a high-magnification alchemy magnifying glass. The whole person is kneeling on the workbench. A line of lines observes the magic pattern that Richard sent, and he does not know the passage of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the room was completely dim, the gray dwarfs were shocked that the day was already dark. He immediately ordered seven or eight magic lights, lit the room as bright as white, then jumped onto the workbench and continued to observe the magic pattern that was only purchased for 30,000 gold coins. Unconsciously, when the gray dwarf took a breath and stood up, he found that the sky was bright. The tweet's belly reminded him that he had not eaten one day and one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gray dwarf has not taken care of so much, he went crazy and found the top magic bag, carefully sealed the primary agile, and then hurriedly left Dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this month, Richard glanced at his bill as usual, but unexpectedly found the 30,000 gold coins and the 'Su Hailun’s joy' in the sale of the decoration. In addition, there is an additional 800,000 entries, the name is 'construction auction share'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m trying to think back, it seems that there is only one initial agility to hand over to Black Gold. He still has a vague understanding of the price of the mainland decoration. He knows that no matter how an initial stage can not sell 200,000 gold coins, even if his initial agile bonus exceeds the limit of 50%, it is worth twenty. Only then. How is it possible to shoot such a high price, with a total of 800,000? And this income is not from Su Helun, but from Black Gold. With Richard's understanding of the Grey Dwarf, he will never give up all the auctions to himself, and half will not! 40% will not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A preliminary agile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Richard encountered a thorny new problem in the study of the design of the design, so he left it behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gray dwarf suddenly became interested in Richard’s interest, and he will pass by Richard in a day or two. From time to time, he will ask him kindly. what. The gray dwarf's anomaly was disfigured, but Richard's whole heart was devoted to the almost insurmountable problem, and he did not realize what it meant behind the gray dwarf's move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still doesn’t know that his initial agile structure has sold a million dollars in the Holy League! Because it exceeds the wide adaptability of the imagination and the 11% increase in the standard construction, it can be attached to many fourth-order or even third-order structures, thus becoming a composite structure without occupying the structure. The extremely scary construction position of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better the fit of the assembly, the lower the bearing capacity requirements for each of the framed knights. Any assembly must not exceed the upper limit of the load capacity of the construction site, and must have a certain margin. Therefore, even if it is a tailor-made magic pattern, there will be a certain burden of carrying capacity. The higher the order, the more load bearing capacity is. The load bearing capacity of many fourth-order constructions is added up to a full initial configuration. The original intention of the composite structure is to maximize the use of bearing capacity, thus maximizing the combat power of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adaptability and effectiveness of the structure are contradictory, the wider the adaptability, the lower the requirement for carrying capacity, the lower the effectiveness of the single attribute addition. The initial configuration that can reach the level of Richard is not without, but the build-ups that can be found on the market are mostly around 20%, far below the standard 30% bonus. The precious thing about Richard's architecture is the 41% bonus! Beyond the ordinary high-adaptive construction double the bonus effect, people are willing to pay the price is 50 times the ordinary structure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real high-end construction knight, the crush on the construction of the combat force is the ultimate, if Richard can make the addition under the same adaptability 42 With a % build, the price will reach 6 million. This is the law of the high-end market, and the price people are willing to pay for each additional 1% is a geometric progression. The magnitude of the increase depends on the extent of the scarcity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know these details at the moment, I don’t care if I know. His gaze has been placed farther away and will not change for the immediate benefit. Black gold is also a very reasonable and principled gray dwarf. Although he is expecting more magic lines, he has never urged Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is so quietly passing, Deep Blue seems to never change, but people who live in the dark blue will be one year old every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring is here, and gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When another spring arrives, Richard is shocked that he is fifteen years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 years old, on the mainland of Noland, means adulthood. At this time, Richard is already a level 8 magician, and completed the last standard of the first-order magic pattern last night. At this point, he has learned all the initial construction, only to be made into a second-order structure, you can declare it is a true configurationist. This is just a matter of time, and it won't be long. In fact, if it wasn't for Richard's insistence on learning all the standard primary constructs, or if he could make a secondary build. The art of the dark world of Naa has also taught all the basics to Richard. What is lacking now is only the actual experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master is still missing most of the time. Ever since I saw the mountains and the sea, she stayed in the dark blue for less and less time. Most of the time she went to the depths of her face. I don’t know what I’m busy with. Anyway, it’s mostly related to making money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, in the spring, it was the birthday of Richard, and it will not be long before it is the day of fate. The fate of each year is different. There will always be a difference of one or two days before and after, because only the seven-string moon will hang high in the night sky, and the tide will change the power of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the eve of the day of fate, Richard suddenly felt that he had arrived when he left Deep Blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun still did not come back, but Richard vaguely felt that she would not come back, until she left, the legendary Master will return to dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night of fate, Richard has already sorted out his own things, and also informed the news that Black Gold is about to leave. He still doesn't know where he is going, but he believes that when the day of fate is over, there will be an answer. After deep into the magic world, Richard's intuition gradually became sharp, which is actually a sign that his magical power is gradually improving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard made an exception and did nothing, but cooked a cup of tea, like an old man, sitting quietly in front of the French window, watching the seven-stringed moon Shining ice floes. In the fifteen years of life, as the fog is also exposed, one by one flows through the bottom of my heart. Richard didn't make any comment on his past, just recalling all the important things, and that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
