			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of Richard is still within the bottom line, and Nei is in battle In the midst of failure, it is inevitable to pay a part of the cost of the parish. Even if it is his core parish, it can only be said that the inner good luck is not good, and the words of Richard clearly do not mean to ask the Sequoia Kingdom for territorial claims, so Among the whole thing, the most severely damaged in the secular power system is the king of the Sequoia kingdom, but the king of the Sequoia kingdom is dead and alive and has something to do with them. The forces represented by these messengers are more willing to see Richard. Put all the anger on the Sequoia King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the messengers have an old-fashioned gaze. They feel different from the last time they took the troops they took during the expedition. The last time Richard was just a parade. With pure cavalry, this time the number of troops carried by Richard is three times that of the last time, and the arms are more complete, especially the reassembled infantry of the team. It can be seen that this time It is prepared to forcibly knock open the door of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard did verify the conjectures of the messengers. He marched straight into the battle and had a fierce battle with the royal army less than a hundred kilometers from the kingdom. It was easy to defeat the number of opponents who had just over 10,000, and then forced the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two great mages in the team, Richard, once again 'knocking open' the door of Wangdu, long drive straight, this time no longer pull out and His royal banned the knight to obstruct, so Richard was able to go straight to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next? As expected, in the palace of the palace, Richard gave the king a slap in the face and then called the House of Lords to announce The king abdicated and was succeeded by his younger brother Marquis Usas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask for more requirements from the royal family, but went directly to the Great Shrine of the God of Courage. Richard’s speed of entering this road is too Fast, it didn't take much time to knock on the door of Wangdu, so that the gods of the god of courage could not react at all, and even had not had time to transfer important material documents in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small-scale battle took place at the door of the Temple of Courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to stop Richard, the remaining number of Shrine Knights launched a fatal impact on Richard, which included many trainee knights who could only be regarded as teenagers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed the long and magnificent steps of the gods and smashed the interception of the followers of Richard with the glory of faith and flesh and blood. Their Knights of the Knights actually rushed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the team felt a deep surprise and then screamed at Richard, he could almost imagine the sword piercing the heart of Richard. The scene, how incredible, Richard is just a magician, and such an important leader, actually died under his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the knight has not come to continue to think about it, and the head is screaming, then the eyes are black and the body slowly falls down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took back the fate of Gemini, very satisfied with the hardness of this legendary staff, not every staff can stun a senior shrine through the helmet The Cavaliers can still be harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw that the remnants of the gods of courage were shocked, and their followers were taken for granted, so he sprinkled After a smile, the fate of the twins waved forward, the knights behind him immediately rushed up like a wolf, three fists and two feet to collapse a priest, and then violently pressed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha strode into the temple of the god of courage, looked up at the glorious and majestic image of the god of courage, and then called the great priest who presided over the temple. Come over and let him stand in front of the statue and send a few knights to guard the gods with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Nei’s divine power withdraws from the idol, the sacred image is a taboo and will become the enemy of the gods, even if he is in fact already hostile to Nei’an. The goddess of the three goddesses of the state does not work either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard will certainly do this kind of superficial effort to be perfect, acting like a god of the Faro's own position, at this point, Richard is a very powerful man. His former teacher, Theodore Lon Noland, can deceive. As an outstanding student of Deep Blue, Richard deceives Faro's earth gods naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t swear by the gods, but it doesn’t mean he can’t get a good way. Now he’s transferred a team of knights, surrounded the gods, and then stood on the side. There, Gao Sheng and the great priest discussed the conditions for ending the church war, while they signaled that the knights could start searching the Great Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights are all extremely wicked, rude, and have a little glimpse of things that have been seen and removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a blatant robbery. Although it is also in line with the identity of the party that triumphed in the church war, even if it is a spoils, it will be as simple and rude as Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the power of Nei is still in the image of God, the god of courage who is high in the heavenly kingdom can see everything that is happening in the temple through the eyes of the gods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the divinity in the eyes of the gods is scattered, and the consciousness of the inner peace has been tempered to return to the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and patted the shoulder of the great priest and asked: "There is no secret cabinet in the statue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is, this is the convention, and it is useless for the big priest to deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the closet, Richard unexpectedly saw a very familiar paper, and the heartbeat actually accelerated a few points, that is the residual page of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think that I would find the residual page of the book in the Great Shrine. Such an absolute artifact-level item was not sent to courage. The Great Temple, but in the temple of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard immediately awakened that the character of the book should be at least two pages to appear. The separate pages are still on the level of Faro’s alchemy skills. It seems very magical, but the effect is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the first page of Richard’s book can only release a level 5 magic. For high-level magicians, the use is not bad. Not too much, but when the three-page book is brought together, it is five seven-level magic, which is also very important for the current Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing." The great priest saw that Richard took the residual page of the book that was carried, and called it to come up, but Tiramisu picked up the giant With a gentle shot, the big god officer was easily photographed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear swayed the page of the book that carried the book and said, "This thing is my spoils, but it looks really bad."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, according to the ancient agreement of the war of God, you are right." The great priest gasped and said that the knights of the god of courage were all heroic, but the priests It’s much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest then extended his finger to a very ordinary booklet and said, "Hello, this thing has no use for you, I can take it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The book itself does not have any specificity, but it is placed in the secret cabinet inside the statue with the broken pages of the book. Richard then moved his curiosity and reached over and saw the cover: "Sin and Punishment," he opened it and found that it was a book of believers in the church at various stages of the record, a leader outside the church, and a roster of people who were regarded as sinful by internal security, behind each person's name. There is a nuanced portrait and the crimes and trial results they have committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and suddenly saw a familiar face inside. He thought about it and found the name Essien in the depths of his memory. The priest, that is the priest who had died with him when he first arrived at Faro, and he grabbed the book on the first page in that battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what really impressed Richard was Essien’s diary, which can be said to be the future generation of Faro’s prophet, but because of Richard’s The arrival has changed the fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went down to see Essien’s charges and trials on charges of incompetence with the ectopic invaders, causing the temple of the god of courage to fall, the idol being Hey, the penalty for Essien is the life of the Jedi, in Black Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly raised the roster, then put it in his arms and asked the great priest: "Where is the black valley?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest is reaching out to Richard, who seems to want to snatch the roster, but he does not dare. The problem with Richard is that Nono’s unwillingness to answer, but Fear of the consequences, Black Valley is the largest place of hard work in the Church of Courage. The composition of the exiles is extremely complicated. Once it falls into the hands of the hostile church of God, it will inevitably involve a lot of troublesome things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In accordance with the principles of the war, I can add a few more bodies, of course, you can also reach a final agreement here." Richard said faintly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...I understand." The Great God Officer took the map and sketched a place on it. It was a no-man's land in the Iron Triangle. When I looked at the location, I knew that the natural environment was bad. I didn’t expect it to be the place where the god of courage exiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
