			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of Richard is not far from the dusk castle, and the army is in a hurry for the next half of the day. It is far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reporting the intention, the officer who guarded the castle gate asked Richard to wait outside the castle, and then notified the Baron Xiaofang Dan. The goalkeeper's strength is good, there are nine levels of appearance, but here is a small official who is guarding the door. If the count is almost the same, a baron castle is a bit extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine-level fighters can mix in a good position, so it is not impossible to use the nine-level fighters to guard the door, but most of the baron’s income is still Not enough to support them in doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked coldly at the officer who walked into the castle and found that he had not seen this person in the first day of the war. In the battle to kill the bears in the town, a nine-level officer is definitely the pillar of the local battlefield. Richard believes in his memory, and the baron will not forget all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An outside guy is guarding the door here, apparently to filter out some unwelcome people." Richard thought, and waited patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an entire hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha had already left the horse and sat quietly on the avenue in front of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many inhabitants and ordinary warriors who enter and leave the castle. Many people’s expressions are clearly recognized by Richard in the battle of the day. However, their faces all looked a little different. A gaze fell on Richard, but no one said a word. They waited for a long time before they quietly talked about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an unwelcome person, and they already know it. But there is no stupid guy who wants to make a merit jump out and scream something. Even if Richard is only a pioneering knight on the side of the nobility, it is not that these civilians can be insulted at will. Insulting the aristocrats was killed, afterwards, Richard would only have to pay a small amount of money to Baron Xiaofangdan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun is getting more and more blazing, and the shade that had been shrouded in Richard’s body is gradually removed. After Richard, there was already a strong murder that began to pervade. Splashes, Gangde, Sandru, and even barbarians are extremely killing. Not to mention the sand people, they have always been known for their cruelty and ruthlessness. Only the singularly throwing soldiers are not moving like a wooden stake in the same place. They are only fighting units and have no thoughts of their own. Elite throwing soldiers have enough wisdom to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is still sitting, waiting patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour passed, and Richard just stood up, and the goalkeeper officer hurried out of the castle and said to Richard: "The Baron is now free. I am waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and stood up and walked into the castle. The officer immediately stopped Richard and kissed Gangde and several barbarians behind him and said, "They can't go in, you can only enter the castle yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and looked at the officer and asked faintly: "The army has stayed outside, but I can't even bring my own entourage?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer sighed heavily on the ground and said evilly: "You are just a little pioneering knight, the baron adults will see you well, and bring a dog / fart!" The officer's attitude toward Richard is only a cold and routine, but now it seems like a magical siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stared at the officer for half a minute and suddenly smiled. He waved his hand behind him and said, "Gunde! Half-mouth and one leg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Gangde came out with a loud hand and grabbed the officer. The officer was stunned, but he only felt that Gangde’s arm was as hard as a steel column. He slammed his arm and slammed his neck and lifted him up. Then he slammed a dozen heavy slaps, and the officer was dizzy, and the blood-stained teeth splashed. Then Gangde slammed him on the ground, stepped on his knees with a big foot, and slammed it a little. The knee-padded nails made of steel were completely deformed and smashed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer screamed like a pig, and then his eyes turned, and he fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knew he couldn’t hear himself, Richard still said faintly: "You don’t even have a small pioneering knight, but dare to do this to me. Speaking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more than a dozen guards who stood in front of the castle at dusk and stood still like a statue, clenching their long-handled weapons. In the gate of the castle, several swordsmen poked their heads out, and they took out the swords and wrapped them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the guards and said faintly: "You better inform the baron. In addition, if anyone will throw the weapon on my head." If you think, this is the declaration of the baron of the small Fang Dan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards looked at each other, and many people showed their coziness on their faces. The high-lifting weapons are also slowly put down. The few swordsmen who came out of the door looked hard at the unconscious officer on the ground. The sword was still in his hand, but no one was approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked coldly at these people, the guards had a few familiar faces, but the swordsmen were all very strange, but he keenly noticed that Two of them are very similar in style to the Baron of the late Fang Dan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several older guards quickly crossed the swordsmen and rushed into the castle to inform the baron. Those who stayed back a few steps back. Their eyes flashed, avoiding Richard's eyes. From time to time, they looked at the unconscious officers on the ground and looked at the followers behind Richard, but no one dared to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards here mostly participated in the fierce battle. They were familiar to a few people behind Li, and they were able to participate in the battle with Sinclair. The role, really want to fight, they are not enough for just a few people to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, they remembered the terrible power hidden under the unremarkable pioneering knight’s title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard only waited for two minutes, and the general manager of the castle ran out. He saw sweat on his forehead. Obviously, he was extremely anxious all the way. As soon as he saw Richard, he gasped and said: "Richard, the baron has a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like nothing has happened: "What about my entourage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler glanced behind Richard and said: "The soldiers need to stay outside the castle, and your personal followers can of course Bring it in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go in with me!" Richard took a hand and pointed at at least twenty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... seems a bit too much." The butler desperately wiped the sweat that seemed to be inexhaustible, but eventually did not dare to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
