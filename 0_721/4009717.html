			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass soon bottomed out, and the news has not yet arrived. Stevenson was slightly dizzy, so he felt that he was drinking a little faster. Minnie poured wine for him again, this time a full cup. So the Dragon Warlock regained hope and slowly tasted it. This is an important moment. Every great person will experience many such important moments in his life, and their common feature is that the more calm they are at this time. The Dragon Vessel Warrior has a great mind and has read many biographies of great people since he was a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he is very calm, patient, and very satisfied and proud of his patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup is empty and full, full and empty. When the bottles were empty, Stevenson could no longer maintain his deliberate calm. A full two hours! Don't say killing a person, that is, killing a street is enough! But the news is like a stone sinking into the sea, completely disappeared. No news came, no matter whether it was success or failure, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat suddenly came out and soaked his body clothes. When he raised his head and widened his already blurred eyes, he saw that Minnie’s face was also pale, and the hand holding the empty bottle shook involuntarily. Stevenson grabbed Minnie's hand and shocked her, shaking her hand, and the bottle slammed on the ground. Stevenson was not so angry, but was rubbing her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini’s hand is as cold as she has just washed from ice water. She is obviously worried and afraid. She may have an excuse to do it before, but this conspiracy was deeply involved and became one of the important roles. The fate of her and Stevenson is firmly tied together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the conspiracy to reveal, Minnie simply did not dare to think. A good ending like Randolph certainly cannot be extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do? Are we going to escape?" Stevenson asked suddenly. Deep fear has caught his heart and made him lose his ability to judge. He just wants to escape from the dark blue and flee back to the family territory. The future, the builder, the glory, all this made him think that he could give up everything for him. When compared with life, it was so insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Minnie calmed down. She pulled her arm from Stevenson's hand and then held his palm in the opposite direction, saying in the calmest voice: "No, we can't escape. Here is the ice floe, more than six thousand from the sacred dynasty." Kilometers, it’s unrealistic to escape. And are you sure you have escaped a legendary mage? It’s just that the seven great magisters come out one by one, and we can’t escape a hundred kilometers away.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson finally calmed down a little, still with a trace of luck, said: "Maybe they have succeeded..." But half of it he stopped, even if his thoughts have been burned Alcohol was slow, and Stevenson knew that his guess was too ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do now?" Stevenson was completely panicked, and Minnie, who was still calm, became the only straw he could catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie shook her head and said, "Of course not. I mean we can’t have any little tricks against Richard. Nothing can be. Now, if we want If you want to keep yourself, you can only ask the family for help, tell the family about the original things and see what they can do for us. If the family is willing to pay enough compensation, then the legendary wizard may forgive us." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
