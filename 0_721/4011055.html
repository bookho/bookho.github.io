			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now, not only exchange, but also signed a heavy armistice agreement, such an agreement, as long as the three superpowers of Wang Ting are still alive, they cannot Being repented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last pride of the high elves on the green continent was finally torn by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrender of the footsteps of the saints means that the Elf Wang Ting has lost another gem from the era of the Elven Empire, except that the high elves of Wang Tingzhong actually It is not particularly sad. This is not the first time anyway. When I fled the vast green continent, those priceless treasures lost more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked the two silver pages, and he was very emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he is very clear that the decline of the high elves is not because of the difference between the world tree, but because they closed themselves and squatted The vast and treacherous seas are separated by a powerful fleet that was passed down from the era of the Great Empire. These high elves placed themselves comfortably in the nest on the green continent, and lived a comfortable, smashed, closed and arrogant day. Every day, I am anesthetized by the glory of the era of the Great Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of Wang Ting, or the Port of Samui in the open sea, the most common saying by the high elves is that we have tens of thousands of years of brilliant civilization, but they never understand The past is the past, after the millennium's self-restraint, even the gray dwarf's shipbuilding technology has surpassed the current high elves, not to mention Richard's warship transformed by the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the naval battle, Richard did not even have the opportunity to use the seven magical giant ships to kill the ultimate trick: the song of July, only by guns and bombs, all The Wang Ting Third Fleet was smashed and the other two fleets were scared to hide on the West Coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the millennium, the races were based on quantitative advantages, and seized the opportunity of the sudden eruption of the elf empire, at the expense of the majority Drive the high elves out of Noland. Now, if there is no obstacle to the ocean, if it is not awe of the old elf empire, then any of the three empires can conquer the entire green continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, before embarking on the Cangqing mainland, Richard himself did not believe that he would encounter such a weak superpower, the level of the Elf Emperor did There, but the combat experience is not as good as a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two saints' footprints are unknown in the eyes of the Elf Wang Ting, but Richard knows their purpose. This is the two pages of the book of Destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took out the book of destruction and put the two pages of the book up. As a result, the book of destruction was absorbed one by one, and the book of destruction changed again. It became more quaint and simple, with a mysterious symbol on the cover, and a hand-painted regular tetrahedron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After joining these two pages, the book of destruction is close to perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book page turns the number of pages of the Book of Destruction into infinity. In fact, it is not infinite in the true sense, but every time Richard enters a rule. The force will form a new page, and the other page will increase the upper limit of the rule creation generated by the book of destruction to 20 levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed his hand on the book of destruction, and his mind moved to the book of destruction that had reached the level of life at the bottom of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the book of destruction opened on its own, and the pages of the book continued to change, eventually condensing into a three-month temple and a tree of restoration. Image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at these patterns and suddenly said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Avalanche of the Moon Temple is a master of the Azure of the Moon. It is a master of healing. The magic can make dozens of seriously injured people recover in an instant, and the restoration of the tree of life can quickly add the power of nature to the three Azure rituals. With this combination on the battlefield, it can be said that the troops of thousands of people will become immortal. The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural rule is formed by the elf prophet, and the level is only raised to the 19th level. This is obviously because Richard’s control over the natural rules is not deep enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha constantly puts the power of the rules he controls, and eventually forms dozens of different pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception is the rule of the Reaper, which does not allow any reaction to the Book of Destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the real name of Dissmason is still tetrahedron, there seems to be no other changes, but Richard carefully observed the experience, but found the tetrahedron for the first time. The bottom three vertices are composed of three rules: order, neutrality, and chaos, but the upper vertices are attributes, but even Richard himself does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was deeply satisfied with the book of destruction. Now that there is a book of destruction, Richard is like a strong man who has hundreds of people over the sanctuary at any time. It seems that he can also be in the future. Like Su Hailun, play the group route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a long knife and observed it carefully. This knife is the moonlight, the holy knife of the elf era, but it does not know what it has experienced. In the hands of Gotton, it was almost destroyed into scrap iron. Only the indestructible attribute was like a point. Later, after several enhancements, it was only after the addition of the ultimate sharpness that it reached the level of artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time after occupying the Elf Wang Ting, Li originally wanted to pick something up on the giant tree that reached the top of the golden world tree, preferably again. Take a small tree heart for analysis by yourself and the mother nest. The result is self-protection. Wang Ting's world tree actively indicates that he can strengthen the moonlight again for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight blade now becomes darker and exhibits a slight distortion of vision, adding a property on the moonlight that Richard has never seen before: The transition is chasing, it gives the moonlight a spatial attribute, the blade can span different spaces, and can cross the space to catch those enemies who are hiding in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if Richard’s hands are now in the moonlight when he was in the first battle, then he would not escape the moonlight even if he jumped into the void. But it may be seriously injured because of surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this moonlight, restored the true style of the holy knife that year, the transition to chase is also the unique attribute of the legendary holy moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the moonlight around his waist and walked out of the cabin to the deck of the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far horizon, there is a large island that has gradually revealed its outline. At this time, several high elves have come up one after another, one of which is an elegant elf woman. The sacrifice came to the side of Richard and was deeply polite, saying: "His Royal Highness, our destination is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elves and higher elves are slightly The difference is that they are all silver moon elves, most of them are moved from Nolande to the Cangqing mainland after the Yongye Forest was destroyed. They are the people of Elani and Yi, and they are also the mothers of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also saw the distant horizon like the mainland, which is a huge island with a distance of 100,000 square kilometers and nearly 1,000 kilometers from the green continent. Far away, the original Elf Empire stationed an outpost here, but in the Armistice Agreement, the big island also fell into Richard's pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li told a night elf mage to take a magic box and said, "His Niya, this is the seed of the golden world tree. With it, you will be able to live on this island for a long time, and let the silver moon The elf grows again, and I expect that after a hundred years, the Silver Moon elf can reproduce the prosperity of the era of the Elven Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya took over the magic box When both hands are a little trembling, this golden world tree is the future of the entire Silver Moon Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver moon elves have been evacuated from Noland to the Cangqing continent, and the encounter is not good. On the green continent, the stars, the popular and the night language elves Taking the top position of Wang Ting, the Silver Moon Elf was excluded from Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland's Silver Moon Elf has developed itself for a thousand years, and the high elves of the Green World have actually become somewhat out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of the eclipse, in addition to not accustomed to the faces of these high elves, but also to take away the seeds of the golden world tree, If she does not take the seed away, she will be managed to take it away by the elf king of the time. Without the silver moon elf of the world tree, it will really cut off all hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of misunderstandings, the golden world tree was planted by Richard in Green Forest, and this war was again from the hands of Elf Wangting. I got a new golden world tree species. During the stay of the Elf Wang Ting, Richard specially contacted the Silver Moon Elf and was willing to give them the new home as a new home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all the tribes of the Silver Moon Elf are together with tens of thousands of elves, this big island is enough for them to live, and in the future, with the growth of the Golden World tree, the island The area can continue to increase. At this time, the Yinyue elves have become ordinary tribes in the Cangqing mainland. As the patriarch's Niya knows the arrangements of Richard, he is surprised and happy, and naturally there is no reason to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet slowly entered the port. At the same time, the warriors of the Elf Empire are lining up to board a warship of the ships, they will be completely evacuated, and the seven giant warships of Richard Compared to the high elf ship, like a seesaw, seeing a team of silent and silent night elves coming down from the huge ship, when they set foot on the port, the high elf warriors were full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, when the night elves first appeared in front of the high elves, the harvest was mostly contemptuous and curious, and now all become awe And fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
