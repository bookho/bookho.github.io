			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; () <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then bells sounded in the arena, the arena hosts vibrant Jumped into the center of the gladiatorial field. It was a big dwarf with a fiery beard. Behind him, there are two women who are almost naked and full of shiny oil on the whole body, such as the cloud of mud with dew. Along with the exaggerated screams of the dwarves, they are constantly making various temptations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, more than a dozen people began to swim in the arena and accepted the bets from the audience. In the box on the second floor, there are some girls from all races. In addition to providing basic services such as tea and water, they also have some other key services, such as when the fight is the bloodiest. There will always be a few VIPs who are excited about the animal hair, and they directly push these girls down and slam on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gladiator is roughly a hollow space of 20 meters in diameter, only one meter deep, and a half-meter low wall is built around it. This is all the protection, so when the corner is the most intense, it will often affect the nearest onlookers. This unexpected bloodyness is also one of the attractions of the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the box has been occupied, Hoven, Huli, Karon and Mark are all in the box, only the Thunderbolt is missing. Richard also observed an additional mark for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody mark grows abnormally tall, the muscles are like iron, the chest is covered with a thick layer of black hair, and his upper body is still open-chested, like Show the medal naked / exposed, it seems that there is no orc, or the blood of the barbarian. From the beginning, Mark, who was separated by a box, glared at Richard, and after talking to Hoven, Richard began to observe Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from a face that is fierce and jumps directly to the hands. Richard is very calm, just moving his eyes a little bit on Mark. Let go of every detail. Whether he is glaring or roaring, it is better than the most inferior gestures. Richard just stares at Mark in his own way. The more Mark's movements, the more detailed the information obtained in Richard's digital vision. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Mark couldn’t stand the gaze of Richard, swearing something in disgust and shifting his gaze to the arena. He was crazy again, and he did not openly disrupt the order. He played with a foreigner in the stands of the arena. If you do that, you will provoke the most powerful thunder hammer in the camp. Of course, if the outsider can't stand the provocation, it is another matter, but unfortunately the scene he expected did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game has already begun, and the next four human slave warriors are fighting against a hungry demon bear. The battle soon began to see the blood, and as the magic bear cut a soldier's chest and abdomen into the **. After a while, this mad-haired demon bear has thrown all the warriors, and began to chew in the face of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is flowing, the organs are dripping, and the ends are covered with the bear's paw and the fur on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody, so that the cheers in the arena gathered together into a heavy sound, the excited people can hardly find a more pleasant way to vent. An unlucky guy was pushed and accidentally dropped into the field from the low wall, immediately attracting the attention of the devil bear. In his desperate and high-pitched voice, the devil bear flew in, and he clawed his half head! The audience on the first floor not only did not cringe, but pushed each other and set off a second wave of cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was carried out in a round. After a few games, the soldiers of various forces began to participate in the war, and even the small leaders of the two forces directly confronted each other. Happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
