			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last kill of Richard, superimposed on the explosion, the magic Armed, life-threatening, the star of the well, and the power to destroy the real name, after the outbreak is erratic, if you have your own soul, and then no control, how powerful this knife, even Richard himself is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wald was cut by the blade, the body became alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde is simply pleading for death, so that such a powerful and rigid man can only die, there must be a reason behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the House of Lords’ sudden motion to review the Duke’s qualifications, to Wald’s own death, Richard only felt that there was a darkness in the dark. Net, is squatting to his own pressure, this time the enemy, no longer like Mensa, Joseph floating in the water, but makes Richard feel more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Richard feels that there is some clue for the time being, but if the House of Lords considers the behind-the-scenes of the Duke’s qualifications and forces Wald to die If it is the same force, then it should soon be on the water, because it wants to drag the title of the Duke of Richard for a year. If there is a plot, it should be launched within one year. Richard decided to temporarily put it. These things are put down, and it’s useless to think about it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard is in the command of Wald. The style of the entire command is rough and simple. The only decoration is all kinds of equipment, armor and beasts. Head, the commanding room is the place where Wald lives. It is a separate unit consisting of two rooms and one bathroom. Only then, the furnishings are equally old and not like a guarded plane. The generals are somewhat similar to the poor horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde's relics are not many, the most valuable is the necessary all kinds of armor armor, in addition to the private property is surprisingly small, counted out There are only a few dozen gold coins, which makes Richard, who is already used to measuring millions of gold coins, somewhat awkward. Although Gordon is poor, he will not let the 13th Cavaliers be so poor. According to the generals, Wald Most of the income earned was used in the defense of the plane. The younger half was sent to the family. Most of the equipment of the boxing fighters was taken from the enemy after the bloody battle. The gold coins used in the defense of the plane were actually built. Fortifications and the purchase of weapons, Wald is actually using his own money to subsidize military spending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the inside and outside of the castle, Richard enlisted the command post, but people sealed up Wald’s former residence, and he found another bedroom in the castle as a place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard launched a magic map, and according to what the generals told, they began to add various markers and symbols on it. This magic map is Richard. With the accuracy and function, it is more than double the original one. Correspondingly, the price is more than ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the meteorite highland is located on a rather ridiculous highland, where the climate is dry and cold, only two or three months a year. Rain, when I walked out of the plane of the plane, Gotton looked at it and saw a wilderness. There were large and small meteorites on the earth, so I named it here as the meteorite highland. It is also the origin of this plane name, the meteorite. The highlands are not just highlands, but the ridiculous highlands seen in front of them are too vast. The detectives that have been out before have already reached a thousand kilometers away and have not yet seen the edge of the highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorites also have a variety of indigenous fierce beasts and humanoids of intelligent life. In this deserted land, water is the most precious resource, the plane The place where the gate is located is in a natural spring, so it is possible to establish a base city, but every once in a while, the base will be attacked by the beasts of the beasts and even the natives of the planes. Most of the creatures on the meteorites, including the indigenous They are all underground activities. They are born with earthy abilities. They often have dozens of kilometers of passages overnight, so the army from the main plane is also a headache for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only valuable resource discovered in the meteorite highlands is iron concentrate, which is a mineral sand that can directly refine high carbon steel and is the main raw material for the Knights. There is a shallow iron concentrate area in the hilly area 300 kilometers away from the base city. The huge reserves are enough to be mined for hundreds of years. The problem is that if you want to mine, you need a lot of manpower, you need to build a road, and you need Water sources, these can be attributed to one point, huge investment, Richard initially estimated that at least three or four million to be able to make the mine run, in the long run, the development of such a vein, the ordinary soldiers' weapons and equipment There will be no shortage of raw materials, and with the military base built with Nolan, Richard’s war machine will be completely operational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Valley can provide blood for the magic industry, the meteorite highlands are the equipment guarantee for the army, and the mysterious Shulan has a treasure that the strong can not resist, the nest In the ancient starry sky battlefield, every piece of debris has invaluable value. It must be said that the quality of several planes that Gordon got is very good, and the resources are complementary. Sitting on such planes, in time, Kemond's strength will grow rapidly. To say that these planes have the common shortcoming, they all need a lot of investment to develop, and the stability of the plane channel costs more than the normal plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens that the most lacking of Gordon, who started from scratch, is the gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, closed the magic map, began to meditate, and after a while he entered the world of meditation, in a void, Richard’s blood is still The same distribution, but after the green power plane took a little bit of the original source strength, the natural life tree top has a twig, a few green leaves like spit and spit, when they fully grow, natural life The tree will be promoted to the fifth order, I wonder if it will inspire a new real name like the magic star tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few pieces of young leaves may appear to grow at any time, but in fact they are not so simple, only the source of power released from the crystallisation of the Greenson plane, They can continue to grow, but the crystal-like crystallization will take a long time to release a trace of the source of power, which is again vying for the five life trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the blood, two stars and a huge source of crystals are flying around. These are the forces captured by Richard, and it is difficult to completely digest them. When this situation appeared, Richard observed for a while and suddenly understood the true meaning of the three stars. It is that Richard does not meditate, and they will continue to release power for Richard to absorb. This is similar to the well of the Stars. The more such stars, the smaller the dependence of Richard on the time of meditation. The description of the number of stars in the dark blue meditation is very vague, just say that the more the better, the other explanation is that a star is qualified, two The pieces are not bad, more than three depends on luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s because of Richard’s current spiritual strength, and it’s extremely difficult to pull a huge star. For example, the power of the Greenson plane is strong enough that Richard’s roots are The point of immobility, fortunately, when the tree of life is promoted, some of the source power is broken, and Richard can take a piece of the source crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deepening of meditation, Richard’s spiritual power gradually emanates, and a little bit of starlight gradually appears in the void, except for Starpower, there are more It is a yellow earth element air mass. As the spirit of Richard continues to deepen, a khaki-colored star emerges in the void in the edge of consciousness. This star represents the power of ordinary, but it is not particularly large, just right. Suitable for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately concentrated his energy and tried to pull it. The star suddenly shocked and slowly changed the trajectory and flew over to Li. Li Carefully control the trajectory of the star. If it is directly hit by the blood, I am afraid that it is not a harvest, but a tragedy. When the star slanted past the blood of Richard, it just paused and flew far away. Go, Richard immediately guided it back to fly back, but this time it was still only a little stagnant, and it continued to fly into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
