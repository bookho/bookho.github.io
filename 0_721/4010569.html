The soldiers in all directions were proverbs and alliance tribes. The hunting team was killed and injured in an instant. The hunter rushed out of the encirclement and came back to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the hunter’s report, Richard said coldly: “The forest camp of the proverb is also the fastest one thousand kilometers away. How are their squad hunters? It will appear near the Yongye tribe, unless your whereabouts are intentionally leaked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elder looks and asks: "How do you know the proverb?" The hunter will not appear in the brigade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people in the tree house, including Merlin, are puzzled. Richard said: "They sent it last time. The hunters and Druids who have been harassing the night are almost killed by me, and then send someone to do something and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hunting teams, yes Who sent it out." Richard once again asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the affairs of the Everlasting Presbyterian Church, you have no right..." An elf elder has just said half, and three fireballs suddenly appeared in front of him. Three fireballs form a triangle, which rotates at a rapid speed. A red light suddenly appears in the center of the triangle, and a pillar of fire suddenly slams into the elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night roared, a big hole appeared in the wall of the tree house, and the raging fire column spurted out of the hole, straight out of the tens of meters, the elder with the fire The stream flew out, and when it landed, it became a blackened beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tree house of the Presbyterian Church, Richard’s cold trial was heard at this time: “Rebellion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You, how are you doing this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Meili, but the other elder elders are silent, gray feathers Then he is still on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to Melin, and took another elder to come over and asked again: "Three hunting teams, who sent them out?" ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder screamed and said: "Yes...the decision of the Presbyterian Church, but we only agree, it is actually the meaning of gray feathers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A glance at the gray feathers on the ground, said coldly: "You actually collude with the proverbs, but fall in my hands, your end will be more miserable than falling in the slang."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard gently vomited, the atmosphere inside the tree house suppressed the extreme is suddenly loose, the surviving elders finally have some blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a faint red halo erupted from Richard, silently passing over the elf elders, and violently erupted when they hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge fireball in the canopy of the tree of life. The chambers of the Presbyterian Church were smouldering in the fire, and after the fire broke away, the figures of Richard and others Appeared in the same place, such a fierce explosion, but did not hurt other people, even the gray feathers did not add more injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeated changes have caused the people of the Yongye tribe to walk out of the tree house and surround the tree of life, but they are related to the elders, but they are I don't know how to choose, most people choose to wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s cold voice sprinkled from the heights: “I and the elders battled to destroy the demon god, but when they came back, they came up with the so-called Presbyterian Church. The elders of the elders are not willing to obey. Now, according to the fate of the elders, the Yongye tribe is under my command, and anyone who dares to doubt this is rebellious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is not so high, but it is extremely cold, and the Everlasting Elf who heard it is like a hail, even the great Druids who are highly resistant to spirit and magic are also born. The chill, the higher the level of the Eternal Night Elf, the more stunned at the moment, because behind the short sentences of Richard, the power suppression represented is really terrible. Of course, they do not know the role of the installation. The structure of Richard's body is broken, but the penetrating power of all kinds of magic is greatly enhanced. It is higher than the effect of spell penetration. Now, the penetration effect of any magic will be improved by two levels. The spell penetration is already comparable to the legendary mage, and the natural magic resistance of the night elves is cut. Not to the extent of almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After declaring his decision, Richard gently slammed the tree of life and said in his consciousness: "If you don’t say anything, I will cut you. Take the tree heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life was silent for ten minutes, and Richard waited for ten minutes without waiting until the Yongye people below began to talk. The tree of life shook a little, shaking off countless fireflies from the branches and leaves. Light spots, gathered on Richard, formed several winding bands around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are in awe, this is the sign that the tree of life has recognized Richard. In the tradition of the elves, the life of the elders is recognized by the tree of life. It is enough to prove the legitimacy of Richard's rule. Of course, there is a third way to achieve dominance, and it is also the most efficient way, that is, conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the gray feathers and threw them into the air. In his secret urging, the tree of life stretched out a few branches and wrapped the gray feathers in midair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the rebellious end of collusion with the proverb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray feathers seem to know I will fight for the fate of my own coming, and I will fight with all my strength: "I am the blood relative of the elders of the elders. The green sky and the everlasting tribe should be mine. It is mine. I am going to kill you. Killing this alien, killing Melin’s **, you will all die, the forest camp of the slang is coming, you will all die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Listening to the hysterical shouting of the gray feathers, a fire star popped up and fell on the gray feathers. The ignition star only ignited a small finger-sized flame, and it was dull and even gray. The clothes could not be burned, but the gray feathers screamed like a burning fire. The branches of the tree of life squirmed, seemingly afraid of the little flame, as far as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flame attached to the power of destroying the real name, and is not restrained by the Green Forest environment, so the life threatening to the life tree is huge, as long as the energy inside Without exhaustion, this prison fire will burn forever, and when Richard's real name of destruction is raised again, the prison fire will absorb the energy of the object being burned to supplement itself, thus increasing the durability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the overall situation has been fixed, Richard said to Melin: "Call out all the important people in the tribe to see me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting place is in the living room where the 茜 茜 , , , , 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永 永The hunter at the domain level, and the silver moon elf mage of a contemporaries, all of them. Although the mage is a silver moon elf from the Yongye Forest, the environment of the Green Forest and the Yongyue Forest are too different. Growth is not good. As time goes by, the mage has not progressed. Anyway, it has fallen to the first level and has become only fifteen. Among the people in the living room, Melin and another sacred hunter are the original. None of the members of the Presbyterian Church entered the Presbyterian Church. This Presbyterian Church is a tool used by Grey Feather to control the entire Everlasting Horde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the meeting, Richard threw several long swords to Melin and two other sacred hunters, saying: "Try your martial arts first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The three elves are all a glimpse, but the long sword is the traditional weapon of the Eternal Elves. The adult elf warriors will be used by each. The three sacred hunters are at the proficient level, but there is no longbow or exclusive weapons. However, it is suitable for testing basic martial arts, but only including Mei Lin, everyone knows that Richard is actually a mage, and a swordsman who competes with swordsmanship seems to be incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard has already put an identical sword in the middle of the living room, and Melin doesn’t understand what Richard wants to do and takes the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Jian holds the sword and said faintly: "Offensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meilin The long sword was raised, and a sword stabbed at Richard's arm. Although she was not short-lived with Richard, she was not aware of Richard's ability. This sword was not only a temptation, but also a fear of hurting Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline’s moment of the sword, Richard’s heart calmed down, and there was a dark red lava flowing in the depths of the eyes. Under the insightful talent, even Mei Lin has already had the strength of the sanctuary. The energy flow on the surface of the body still escapes the examination of Richard. The wisdom talent constantly improves the computing speed of Richard's brain. In an instant, it has broken through the bottleneck of the fifth level and entered the realm of the sixth order. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six levels of wisdom bring not only a tremendous increase in the speed of computing, but also the speed of thinking, and the whole world has become slow in the eyes of Richard, countless The data flashed on Melin, and eventually turned into more than ten different figures. In her hand, the sword edge of the sword stretched out dozens of trajectories in different directions. These trajectories are the directions that Meilin might take. Richard consciousness has been running to the extreme, a trajectory line is constantly lit, and each trajectory begins to flash, which means that Richard has calculated the way to crack, and with the action of Melin, the original trajectory is With rapid reduction, new trajectories begin to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is out of the sword, and the room for adjustment is getting smaller and smaller. The different brightness and color of the trajectory represent the calculation of wisdom talent. The hit and the degree of damage, Mei Lin has just raised a sword, Richard saw that she did not choose the most damaging trajectory, the target is actually his own arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Changjian took a shot and cut directly into Mei Lin’s attack trajectory. Jianfeng went down and slammed Melin’s sword down. Mei Lin’s sword was broken like this. Mei Lin was only a tentative sword. She was trying to increase the intensity of the attack. As a result, the speed of the sword in the hands of Richard suddenly increased, and she brushed her sword to kill her. These swords are obviously unremarkable, but Mei Lin feels very uncomfortable. No matter how to block the dodge, it is like sending his body to Li Jianjian. When he is in a panic, Richard’s sword is already light on her shoulder. Take a light shot and say "Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
