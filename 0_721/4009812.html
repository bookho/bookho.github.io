However, although the Jazz has the dual advantages of vindictiveness and strength, he has never been able to win the opposite Gangde. This brave man is born with divine power, not much worse than Mintel, and has a slick that is completely different from the appearance of the rough ho, which is specially drilled into narrow and complicated areas. Although there is no suitable for his big axe, Mintel's hammer is more limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Mintel angry is that the strength of this base is much higher than that of ordinary dwellings, whether it is walls or wooden doors, it is much stronger than it looks. Often a chain of hammers passed, Gangde had already flashed into a corner, and the hammer could not pass through the wall. Instead, he took a large piece of brick and stone and bounced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a violent attack of physical strength and vindictiveness, Mintel finally got a wish and hardened a few times, and his violent power shook open. Gangde's big axe, the thorn on the hammer hammer left a few deep blood marks on the chest of Gangde. However, Gangde’s hands did not scream, as if there were no injuries at all, the hands of the axe were as stable as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury in the death camp is a common practice, and where it can go to the end, it is a metamorphosis that can completely ignore the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai’s breathing has begun to be a bit heavy, but the opposite of Gangde is like the necromancer’s shackles. If it breaks, it will rise again and it will never look like Will be completely eliminated. Even if it is injured, Gangde’s combat power is not reduced, and the physical strength of this guy seems to be endless! In the battle, Mintai has judged that Gangde has only ten grades. The level of the whole three grades is poor, but it is a tug-of-war. Mintai can't help but be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a stepping knight behind Gangde. He holds the axe with a shield and is mainly defensive. He also has the help of the opposite knight. Lived the back and flanks of Gangde. Gordon’s ten-step knights were not prominent in their talents, but they all had rich experience in warfare. In the melee situation, every step knight has become a rock that stands still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Min Tai is preparing to kill Gangde with anger and morale, and suddenly there is a vague voice in the ear, which seems to be a song. Gangde flashed a faint radiance, so Gangde, who had already been a little tired, suddenly cheered up, and even the power seemed to be a little bigger, continuously blocking Mintai’s full frontal bombardment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn hybrid! The squatting thing! The people!" Mintel was furious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Gangde’s sudden vibe was because the elf bard blessed him with a strong song. In this plane, the bards not only sell art, but also sell well, and the status is equivalent to singing and dancing. It is such a low-lying career, but it has successfully played a role in the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral’s skill is very flexible, moving between buildings, as if in the jungle, occasionally grabbing the opportunity to jump on the roof, Quickly shoot down one or two unlucky fighters and then flee to safety before being rounded up. He pulls the bow to open the string, and almost does not need to take a moment to aim, he can hit the key in one shot. The warrior of the middle arrow will not lose his ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level of bard can bless the battle song for three people, so Gangde and the other two stepping knights immediately stunned and the battle became long again . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde keeps retreating, Mintel is pressing hard. When Gangde exited the narrow alley and stood at a crossroad, suddenly a sacred glow fell on Gangde, so that several wounds in the chest immediately stopped bleeding, and the muscles of the wound squirmed at the speed visible to the naked eye. Gradually gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong treatment!!" Mintel almost snarled hysterically. This magical technique has almost destroyed most of his courageous battles! Where is the pastor? And so powerful, the magic effect is even stronger than the old priest who was shot dead, that is the tenth priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unlikely occupation in the ectopic invaders is the priest, because the rules of the plane are different, and the corresponding gods are different. If the true priest enters a new plane, he will often lose contact with the gods he believes, thus losing the source of divine power. Mana replenishment is slow or trivial, but the biggest problem is that it cannot be promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai swept away and immediately saw the window of a building on the corner of the street. A woman with a priestly appearance disappeared. He immediately pointed to the building and snarled: "Come on! Go and kill the cockroach / son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fighters rushed into the air Buildings, but they just stepped into the door and saw a faint knife rushing over! After a few whistle, the water flower left the hall with the ‘Sleep Guider’, went straight up the stairs to the second floor, then flashed into one of the rooms, went out through the window, and disappeared into another building. The Richard and Liusha, originally on the second floor, had long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, it was a sacred radiance, and a seriously wounded knight immediately stopped bleeding, and blew aside not far from him. A fireball, the soldiers who chased the end of the tail blasted down. The stepping knight took the opportunity to hide into a building next to it. Just give him a few minutes, and the sand-splitting magic can restore his injury to a small half. At that time, you can recover more than half of the combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, fourth, and even more divine radiance is shining, and every time it shines, Mintel’s anger burns even more violently. The battle in which the victory was held was thus reversed a little bit, and none of the slick-riding knights had been killed. Every light of magic means that the battle has been pulled back. And there is that magician! He has put five fireballs and two ice cones. Is his magic the same as that of the pastor, and will never dry up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai would like to kill the wicked pastor in person, but the opposite Gangde is so entangled that he can’t get out. The blood in the base is getting richer and thicker, but most of it is the blood of Minta’s soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hu Bo? Where is this bastard going! Hu Bo! Go and kill me!" Mintel’s growl resounds again Base, but responding to him is a very scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai’s heart suddenly jumped, and a strange sense of panic came quietly. He heard that it was the scream of a certain soldier under his command, but these soldiers have seen blood and killed people, and many have fought with the aliens, that is, they died in battle, and should not make such screams! This is clearly the fear to the extreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is not a death spirit, it will not scare the soldiers. These intruders also seem to be human beings. What exactly will it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams came from a low-rise house at the corner of the base, a soldier was rolling on the floor, trying to climb a huge and strange The bugs get down. This is a giant worm with a length of one meter. It is full of shiny black, dragging the abnormally fat abdomen. The six limbs are very short and very clumsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crust on its back is open, slaps its wings from time to time, and a pair of short and sharp blades are deeply inserted into the warrior’s body, and the head is buried in the warrior. In the body, the chewing sound of Kaka 听 sounded sour. The warrior was caught in a terrible panic. The weapon had long been ignorant of where it was thrown, and it was only able to beat the giant worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
