The sky was grayed out, and the sunshine outside the window was completely out of his reach. In the vast magic laboratory, there is no wind, constant temperature, and it seems that even the air is stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha paved the life guard, lifted the magic pen, slowly dipped the magic into the pen, and the light on the nib was lit up. Just looking at the luster and stability of the magic mans, Richard shook his head and continued to increase the intensity and stability of the magic perfusion. It was hard to stabilize the light, but Richard began to daze in the magic circle, and did not draw a stroke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quietly slipped away in the morning, Richard only drew two strokes, and one of them almost went wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Richard took the magic pen on the table and walked directly to the basin, casting a cold hand against the basin. He controlled the magic power just right, just turning the basin into a mixture of half ice and half water. Then, the basin of ice water was poured on his head by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but have a chill, he stood still, knowing he couldn’t go on like this anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what should be done, Richard is not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and looked at his long, five fingers. The true talent began to outline the numbers on the five fingers, and more and more, to interpret his five fingers in the form of numbers. When Richard is in a world of numbers, he will always become calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the sand is sitting in his room, silently reading the book of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The page is blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if she wants, there will be any content she wants to see on the book of Time, but now the pages are flipped and every page is blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioah leaned against the window and bathed in the sun, the white robes of the gods seemed to never get dust, and the golden patterns blended with the light of the sun.熠熠 熠熠 恍 恍 if the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and said, "What are you suffering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know? !" The sand is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io's smile is always so fascinating: "If I were you, I would stay away from me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand hard to turn the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Li Cha, it seems to be hit." Io said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦的翻书的声. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet he will return to normal tomorrow. But this way, he will eventually give up on you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Time stopped and then slammed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel has nothing to say, and what he said has been said, but it is not good. Oh, no, there is another sentence to say to Richard. He leaned against the window and his lips showed a smile on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of seventeen, it is still a time to clearly shoulder to shoulder, but ultimately in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom can make up for a lot of things, but some can only rely on the years to wash and precipitate. Even the great magician and the gods are no exception, but the gods have other ideas, but they are unwilling and cannot say it. Io knows, but will not say it. He is not a larvae just born, but has a long-term wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, the guards of the heavens have souls, and they are all targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Richard walked out of his room with an expressionless face, holding a box of magic in his hand. The second-order construction life guardian was finally completed, and the speed and effect were better than he had expected. If Lunault sees the whole process, he even wonders if Richard is the alchemy machine that was created for the construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the structure for the Ogre Magi, with it, often like to raise the chances of the Ogre Magi in the first line It is much higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each construction will bring substantial improvement to the followers. Richard may not be able to create a miracle by himself, but he can create a person who can bring miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard just had to close the door, but the action suddenly froze, and then slowly turned back. In the room where he was originally, a shadow was rolling and gradually forming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost almost forgot about it, but when he didn't care, the shadow creatures appeared again! The first shadow of the leopard has already made Richard want to fight to death. What will happen again this time? Once a shadow creature appears, it will always become stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow in the room is divided into two groups. The smaller one is condensed into a huge axe with two hands, standing in a strangely vacant position, and the big shadow is turned into A shadow warrior, holding out a huge axe. The shadow warrior looked around and then stared at Richard, holding the giant axe to the chest and smashing it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow warrior is obviously not a shadow leopard, but only with instinct to fight, but with a high degree of wisdom, and know how to use weapons. The giant axe in his hand has a black diamond-like luster. It doesn't look like the essence, but it really condenses into substance. At the same time, the black smoke is tumbling, and the shadow warrior is constantly condensing the armor, and it is also glowing with black diamonds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what I was thinking, suddenly I threw the magic box in my hand on the floor, my eyes showed a crazy color, and I copied the door silently. The long knife was extinct, and the big step went to the shadow warrior. The long knife trembled, and the scabbard broke the window and flew far! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei’s right hand is flat, with a long knife, less than two meters from the shadow warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle pose, opposite to the shadow samurai, not only full of hegemony, but also can be instantly turned into a dozen of the tactical fighting techniques. Although the sacred fighting techniques are mainly close-knit, but the physical skills are the same, the slightest change, you can develop a close-knit knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow of the Shadow Warrior's eyes is like a complex look. The samurai did not rush to attack. Instead, he saw the pupils who were not visible in the fluorescent light and stared at the striding Richard. He seemed to be observing his weakness. This is definitely not the wisdom that can be found in the shadows of leopards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not want to wait, and the spurt of his spurt had a hot lava taste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grip of the knife was suddenly tight, and the long knife extinction had a sharp whistling sound, crossing the shadow of the samurai body. The shadow axe in the hands of the samurai erected in an instant, blocking the wild knife of Richard! The knife and axe collided and even shot like a rain spark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the knife in both hands, the pace changes, and the long knife slams into the shadow warrior like a gust of wind! At this moment, he breathed like a fire, the sacred fighting technique, the elf secret sword and the blood pulse ability were all integrated under the wisdom ability, in exchange for a knife like a wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the brain, Richard is even more blank. He only feels that the blood of the whole body is burning, just want to get out of the way faster and more sturdy! At this moment, the long knife extinct that cuts out a hundred death lines in an instant has a certain charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the windows of the room were completely blasted, and the wood chips flew tens of meters away! In the wood chips, the extinction is also far away. But the naked eye can see its blade, and it is also wrapped in the shadow of silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow warrior lacks a large body, and there is a horrible hollow in the heart of the left chest. It seems that the fierce arrogance has gone to the majority. And Richard's hands were empty, and the right chest's clothes cracked a big hole, and a striking red line appeared on the skin, and a drop of blood was spreading. The blood red suddenly opened, revealing the red and white flesh and blood below, and even saw a few pale ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finished." Richard said calmly, the tone was like a volcano erupting in the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step back and took a backhand. The unnamed elf knife was caught in the hand, and then a step, almost into the arms of the shadow warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;澎湃的月力, once again drowning everything, and the room is a catastrophe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light stone fires, the battle is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua was the first to appear outside the door, but she only saw the full house. In the middle of the ruined room, Richard was kneeling on one knee and holding the handle of the elf's long knife. It was not supported by its support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the door, but the sound of dripping water was heard in the ears of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembled, immediately flipped a flip, and fell to the front of Richard, but saw that Richard’s right hand was holding his lower abdomen, and blood was pouring from his fingertips. And drop it again and again, and it has already accumulated a fresh spring in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly panicked, trying to pull Richard's hand, eager to see the wound, but did not dare. This wolf-like girl, for the first time, hated herself for not knowing how to cure her injuries. Richard's hand clung to his abdomen and did not dare to loosen it. Even so, blood could not stop pouring from his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderous murder suddenly came, and the voice of Gangde came from the broken door: "Head! What happened to you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet rushed into the room before Gangde, and he reacted very quickly. At first glance, the situation was immediately treated as a healing injury. This is the highest level of treatment he can now release. Due to professional restrictions, he only has to reach level 14 to learn healing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This treatment was very timely, and Richard immediately snorted, and the stiff body began to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
