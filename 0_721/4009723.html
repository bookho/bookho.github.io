But more than Stevenson. Although because of Irene's business, Richard also wants to kill Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for being assassinated, Richard is not on the mind. Because he is very clear, he will be on the battlefield sooner or later. Compared with the plane battle, the assassination of the children in the past few days is not a game. The only cruel and true thing is Naa’s torture of the blood parrot. Until now, Richard did not know that Naa really did not ask for anything, or did not want to listen to what she said, but only showed the possible bloody and cruel future in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard no longer likes to be blocked, the road ahead is still blocked, and it is the Stevenson who he does not want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Warlock is still a handsome smile, with an impeccable graceful gesture, extended his hand to Richard, said: "Li Cha, long time no see. Are you going to get a list of auction items?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Stevenson’s face and looked at his hand, there was no The intention to shake hands with him, but directly said locally: "What I do has nothing to do with you! If you can never see me, it will make you laugh more happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s smile was a stiff time, and the followers behind him were awkward and angry. No one thought that Richard would not give face in such a way that such unreasonable words and deeds would at least not conform to the identity of the great aristocracy. Both Soram and Archimonde are now powerful aristocrats, even if they only refer to Archone in Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the main passages leading to the midsummer carnival. The crowds are crowded, bustling, and there are many more outsiders because of the midsummer carnival. These people may not be staying in the dark blue because of their lack of status and financial resources, but they also come to visit in advance, while inquiring about the downswing, while opening their eyes, in addition, the fringe area open to tourists until the bottom of the deep blue main tower, there are some shops, Even if it is not produced in dark blue, it is sold in dark blue, and the quality will never be worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard and Stevenson had a dispute, the crowd began to increase. However, the more people onlookers, the more they fit into the mind of Stevenson. If you can stimulate Richard and make him ugly in front of the public, then the goal is achieved, although this does not help to win the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Stevenson immediately took control of his anger, calmly retracted his hand and continued to say gracefully: "From you, I finally understand why The Kemond family will rise so rapidly. Not everyone can walk the roads that other families have been able to complete for thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few soft sneers in the crowd, and the reputation of the upstart Akmon has now spread throughout the Holy Alliance, and even many of the other two empire have heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is still the expression, looking at Stevenson’s eyes indifferently, saying: “The Archimonde’s family Tradition is always hypocritical for real opponents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevenson’s face was pale again, and his men’s hands couldn’t hold back. The comrades were stepping forward, pressing the handle on the waist and screaming: “You dare to insult Sola. Mum family? Great courage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t look at the servant, and still looked straight at Stevenson’s eyes, saying: "I thought that the last thing would make you smarter. I didn't expect you to be as stupid as before. Is it because your pressure is too great, so you can't sleep without seeing my reaction? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! I really don't know what you are talking about!" Sidvinson laughed, but his face looked a bit unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s counterattack is like a killer’s assassination, unexpected, but direct and fatal. This made Sidvinson, who was used to the courtesy of the upper class, extremely uncomfortable. Moreover, every sentence of Richard is a direct thorn, and there is no room left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was quiet and waiting to see a good show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't know who the blood parrot is, then lick your dog, don't let it scream everywhere, it's not me who is shameful." Looking at Stevenson's sudden face, Richard still does not relax: "And I really don't know where your courage and confidence come from, it seems that Solam and Archimonde have just played one. Hey, don't know what the result is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Ellie. Archimonde, not Gordon!" Stevenson sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not." Richard nodded as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneer in the crowd, and Stevenson realized that he had made a mistake. If you change Gordon, I am afraid that the Soram and the Neo-Allied forces have already been wiped out by the whole army. It will not last for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if it is Gordon in the frontier battlefield, then the other great aristocrats of the Holy Tree Dynasty will not stand by, a small robber is playing the autumn wind, a strong The person is invading. But politics is always complicated, but the result is always simple. The ironclad fact is that a second-rate viscount of the Archimonde family broke the alliance of the Marquis of Neo and the Duke of Soram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the unspoken laughter makes Stevenson realize that this is not the Soram collar, it is impossible for everyone to sell the Duke of Soram. Face. At least those who dare to laugh will never fear the Soram family. What's worse, there are still a lot of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson reluctantly suppressed the raging fury and blood, and did not know what to say. He is familiar with the rules of the struggle between the real aristocratic giants, and he is able to grasp the score without any difference. However, this Richard did not care about any rules, and he said what he wanted to say, and he was so worried that he would casually expose the dirtiest and darkest things to the people. Isn't he afraid of being ridiculed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the depressing place is here. Archimonde has long been named the nouveau riche, and its reputation cannot be broken any more. Cosom has a history of 800 years, although it is still not old, but it is enough to have a long adjective. With Richard's confrontation, Stevenson has lost and won. Richard is the blood of the mad family, but Stevenson does not want to pull his image down to the same level. Moreover, the recent war, Solam is still the defeated party, which makes the most powerful weapon of war threats become an empty slogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everyone knows that it is best not to use war to threaten Archimonde. This is a group of madmen. If you threaten them with war, they will really give you war. The Marquis of Neo is one of the best examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the unspoken rules of the aristocratic years, Stevenson should leave with greatness and pride. Unlike aristocrats and lower-class citizens, the way to resolve disputes should not be a bickering, but a duel, battlefield or court. Brave strength, strength, power, where is the territory of the nobility. He leaves in this way, and will not lose face, but will only get decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Stevenson is still less than 18 years old, after all, there is no 68-year-old city, and finally could not help but ask: "I heard that you just There is something wrong with a woman named Irene. I have to praise your choice because her taste is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a glimmer of light, then dimmed, and restored the clear and calm eyes, nodded in a self-conscious manner, said: "I also agree with you. But I am not worried about this, but if the game loses How are you going to end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson squinted and smiled calmly: "If? If true, if..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading Stevenson, Richard interrupted him: "In the world of magical fabrics, there may be more talent than me. People, but not including you. Think about it, what if you lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson finally said Out any more. What Richard said is the fact that even Stevenson can't deny the facts. The hope of Stevenson's victory lies in the accumulation of resources, the use of family power, and the possible existence of Su Helun's preference. However, Richard’s words stabbed the scene he had been reluctant to think about. What if he lost? The total investment of the Soram family has already moved closer to 20 million gold coins, so the consequences of an investment failure, not to mention that Stevenson himself, his mother and Marquis of Nio can not afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the nightmare may be, does the Archimonde family not support Richard? Isn’t Su Hailun not inclined to Richard? The evaluation of the phrase 'sweet and delicious' is still the shadow of Stevenson's heart. Finally, the decisive battle of the Knights in the territory of the Neo-Otto shows that the level of hidden architects in the Archimonde family is far beyond Santa Cruz, at least in actual combat. Although Santa Cruz added a holy prefix to his name, he himself has not touched the side of the big builder. Obviously, at least one big builder is hidden in the Archimonde family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, Stevenson suddenly found that his probability of winning was not as great as he thought. There are still a few months away from the game and he still has time to consolidate his advantage. But the problem is that the consolidation of the advantage depends on the massive investment of materials, so it falls into an infinite loop. The more you don't want to lose, the more you need to increase your investment, and the more you can't lose, then you need to increase your investment... Sidvinson suddenly I feel that the time in half a year has been too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Stevenson’s face, Richard smiled and walked along his original route. The Dragon Vessels took a few steps to the side and let the road out. Having said that, there is no room for manoeuvre. If you continue to entangle yourself, it will not help. If you are unreasonable, it will only be the Soram family. In the crowd of the crowd, Stevenson also found a few familiar faces, which he has seen repeatedly in various materials, the real big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s words are like a barbarian, a boxing shattered colorful glass, and the harshness and truth of the world outside the window is clearly placed in Stevenson. In front of you. Before, Stevenson had been trying to avoid thinking about these things. He couldn’t afford the consequences, but he was too unhelpful. He disturbed his ideas and stopped his footsteps. Now he was angrily aware that the damn kid succeeded in making him feel uneasy. rather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by the warrior, Richard suddenly stopped and looked up and examined his face. The comrades only felt that Richard suddenly became a slinged dagger, and the sharpness of the burgeoning made him very uncomfortable, feeling as if he had entered the safe distance of the deadly beast. Under the stimuli, he subconsciously stepped back and slammed his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
