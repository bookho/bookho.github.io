			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average person can hardly tell the slight difference between divine power, even the Duke of the Wolf This kind of town-state powerhouse with similar detection capabilities can only roughly distinguish the camp attribute of divine power. However, Richard has seen the book of the gods of Clark's sacrifice, and has already remembered the intrinsic characteristics of the gods. Here is just a matter of knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren gracefully extended his hand to the two priests and said: "This is the god of the great forest goddess Fermi, who currently presides over the goddess in Sequoia. The temple of the kingdom. And this is the god of the great hunting goddess, Xiyou, who is also the host of the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the introduction of Philen, Li The court expressed its respect for the three goddesses with impeccable etiquette and welcomed the arrival of the three priests. This is a complicated and lengthy round-trip speech, but it is an essential prelude to dealing with the priests of the Faro gods, and the more divine gods, the more they pay attention to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard’s heart, there was also a hint of curiosity. The gods of the three gods suddenly gathered in the blue water oasis, but they did not know what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren, Fermi, and Xiyou are all only ten, but they can host a temple, and it is the only temple in the Sequoia kingdom. The embarrassment of the goddess. The god of courage, Nei An, can only be counted in the middle of the Faro, but the great god of the temple, Essien, is also twelve. And Essien’s diary also made Richard look shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Clark’s speculation, the three goddesses are now likely to maintain very difficult divine power. With their church power on the mainland, they must combine the three gods together to be called the three gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this is the first positive contact between Richard and Faro’s face, so the meaning is of great importance. Of course, the contact between the temple of robbing the god of courage and the god of the god of stability, Xerxes, is not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, on behalf of the three-story temple, Philen expressed his interest to Richard. It turned out that in the war of the longitudinal line, the priests of the goddess of spring water and the goddess of the forest realized that the power of the use of Iowa and quicksand did not seem to belong to any known god, but it was extremely powerful, and the nature of the power was biased towards the neutral camp. A group of powerful militants suddenly appear, meaning that the gods behind them have the same powerful power. For a new god, such power is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors immediately reported the matter to their respective temples through secret channels. Of course, they did not know that the contents of the secret report had been carefully reviewed by Richard. I felt that there was no problem and they were able to reach the temple smoothly. Then, the priests of the three goddesses came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the unknown god belongs to the neutral field, which is why Philen and others finally decided to come. The divine power of the three goddesses is also in the neutral field, and there is no conflict in the faith. Between the neutral gods, it is difficult to have a fundamental conflict in doctrine. For this reason, Philen proposed that Richard and the three goddess temples form an alliance, and the three goddess temples will do their utmost to support the development and expansion of Richard. In return, Richard wants to allow the three goddesses to spread the doctrine on the territory of Richard and develop believers. Of course, what they want is to have the same missionary rights as the new god. As for which beliefs believers choose, it is their freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Philen’s suggestion, Richard was an accident, although Philen’s proposal seemed fair in the eyes of Fan Sheng, but he was very clear from the perspective of the gods. That means what it means. I couldn't help but look strange: "Does the three goddesses want to form a god in the neutral field?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these three goddesses, do you want to press the dragon of eternal and timeless? Or, sit flat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the idea, Richard instinctively felt ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland is not Faro, except for the eternal and timeless dragons, the other gods who need to absorb the faith are not so good. Almost all of the legendary powerhouses are unwilling to the gods. Especially those who left Noland before the long time and went to explore the infinite plane, almost every return to Noland will have a big or small storm, and there is a peek into the divine. There are pictures of fire, and even want to turn a god into an artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Noland, the knowledge about the gods spreads very widely, and in some famous places of inheritance, such as dark blue, there are even complete sets of seals. God guide. It’s just that the road is in front of you, but there is nothing in the billions that can go to the end. So in Noland, there is no secret in the gods. The true mystery is mostly related to the eternal and the dragon of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a mouthful, and immediately made Philen’s face change, and looked at Richard in amazement, and said for a long time: “If you are not sure that you are one A great magician, I almost thought that you are the embodiment of God walking in the world! Ah, no! Is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren and others all stood up Obviously remembered that in Faro, the incarnations of the gods often favored the profession of the magician. Richard can tell the mysteries of the gods that belong to the gods. Obviously, they are not ordinary people. These secrets are placed in the goddess of the three goddesses, which the Pope can master. Among other powerful gods, only the big priests of fifteen or more levels are allowed to be slightly involved. Even Philen himself, because of the presiding over the temple, was assigned to undertake this task, only to receive a little teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reaction of the other party, Richard immediately realized the difference in the knowledge of the gods in the two planes. It’s no wonder that Philen put the words so naturally. Not that she is not very clear about the meaning behind her. He quickly waved his hand and said, "Don't get me wrong! I am just an ordinary magician. My teacher is also a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairen is in doubt Still sit down slowly and ask: "So what do you think of my proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Wait a minute, I went to ask the priest to come over. This matter needs to be discussed together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three priests such as Philen also felt that it should be. They had directly searched for Richard, not because of the identity of his lord and the coalition commander, but because he thought that Richard was the darling of the true God. Ordinary clergy are only servants of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sand came to the living room. At this moment, she is temperamental and solemn, and she constantly exudes a sense of divine power, and suddenly makes the three people of Fioren awe. They have all seen that although the sand is also a level 10 divine power, but the divine power is different from them, so the degree of such a thick is mostly a god. And from the reports of the pastors, the number of magical techniques of one person can stabilize the three of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen they even started to be a bit uncomfortable with the previous proposal for equality, but the sand did not seem to mind, there was no agreement with the three goddess temples. Opposing, no additional conditions have been proposed. This makes the three priests very excited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen carefully and solemnly asked: "Respected Sarawak, I can ask the great god behind you, what should I call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
