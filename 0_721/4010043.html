This time, he finally saw the long-lost vitality from his son. The faint years of the wind ravaged the ridiculously dry land, and the aging and scent of the scent was expelled. I don’t know where it was hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke sighed aloud and said, "Sure enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no longer aging It’s only a short year, but it’s a hope! And through this ceremony, the Duke of the Wolf saw more things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the dragon of eternal and time is truly worthwhile. I also saw the supreme power of the Dragon of Time, a ritual hosted by a great priest, who was able to suppress the curse of the gods of the Faro. Finally, he also saw a new kind of belief and feedback model, although the eternal and time dragons demand more, but the feedback is also generous. Moreover, the grace of the sacrifice will not only be a kind of dew, but if it can also include other effects, then the power of the true God can’t be measured. Perhaps Richard and Liusha are right, and the dragon of eternal and time is indeed the true God above all planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony is over, and Palin, who has just received the grace of God, is over-consumed and sleeps asleep. Only Clark looked at the sand with a little doubt. He is now a great priest of eternal and timeless dragons. He began to master some basic knowledge of sacrifice. Because his rank is not low, he naturally sees that most of the gods he received when he sacrificed himself were intercepted by the sand, leaving only one A small part of a life dew is condensed and left to Palin. Moreover, he also learned some simple ways to calculate the grace of God. He always felt that the grace of the dragon was less surprising, and it seemed to have been extracted once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible to fill a private bag in a sacrifice?" Such a disrespectful thought just emerged and was immediately smothered by Clark. The priest is absolutely impossible to hide in front of the gods, and the true God is absolutely fair. Since Palin has a life dew, it means that God's will is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceremony, the Duke and Richard, Liusha came to the Chamber of Secrets and began to discuss the next step of cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke bluntly asked: "The time limit for life dew is only one year! What to do after one year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The deity of life dew can be re-acquired. Just sacrifice it again within a year. And as the level of sacrifice increases, you may get more powerful grace, for example, there is a kind After life, you can get extra life ranging from 3 to 10 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands make the duke look happy, but he does not ignore the most important details. , sacrifices. Thinking of this, the Duke of the Wolf, Bile, also showed a difficult color, hesitating and said: "But the sacrifice... In order to compete for this dragon, I have suffered a lot. I am afraid that within a year, it is difficult to find a similar to Longyan. Sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha comforted: "This is the first sacrifice of the Faro plane. Some gods need to be used to raise the altar of the plane. Communicate with the will of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. The effect of the next sacrifice will be much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The Duke of the Wolf still smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro planes also have dragons, the power of these dragons is similar to Noland and even other planes. The lowest adult red dragon is not a single-level fighter who can single-handedly. The Nolandes sanctuary can single out the dragons, because they have several structures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Billy is a so-called town-state powerhouse, compared with Nolan's same-level sanctuary, only combat experience may be dominant, and individual combat power is ranked in the middle. The backwardness of the magical civilization is not only the difference in the structure, but also in the equipment. Noland's classmate equipment is generally more enchanted than Faro equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsand smiles and reminds: "Duke adults, sacrifices are not necessarily related to dragons, actually creatures related to power, such as demons, devils, stars Beasts and ancient behemoths are good sacrifices. In addition, certain mysterious objects, such as a meteorite from the ectopic plane, may also be accepted by the Eternal and Time Dragon. The last type of sacrifice is The hardest to get, but also the easiest to cause eternal and time dragon interest, is... divinity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dinning!" Duke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, it is something related to the divinity. For example, a descendant of the gods who have the blood of God. Or after many years of worship The spirit of the ancestors. This kind of thing can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke stood up, murderous, hands clenched, staring coldly at the drifting sand. The family of the wolf has always believed in the ancestor worship, and the sacrifice of the ancestors is completely impossible to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is sitting still, looking at the Duke of the Wolf without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke took a deep breath and slowly sighed and murdered, saying: "Our wolves have been ancestors of all ages."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Liu Sha said, "But the Duke, do you not believe in the ancestors of other families?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Duke of the Wolf was shocked and meditated. He knew that the sand drifting would probably open a door to the abyss for him, but he had to step in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not wait for the Duke of the Wolf to answer, and said: "There is one more thing to remind you, the next time you can come to Palin or you personally to sacrifice And choose God's grace on its own. But the grace of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time has a certain scope, and what is God's grace in front of you, no one can confirm it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The randomness of God's grace is indeed the character of the eternal and the dragon of time, and even Richard does not realize what is wrong. The Duke of the Wolf has actually studied the teachings and priesthoods of the Eternal and Time Dragons, and certainly knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even Richard does not know that, as long as the price is paid, the sand can actually narrow the scope around the target. But she is not prepared to do so. Any god of eternal and timeless dragons can be said to be very valuable, so if the sacrifice is started, it will stop. She also hopes that the Duke of the Wolf can use more of his divine grace on himself, and a powerful duke will bring more sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sand and the duke have already finished the sacrifice, Richard said: "Duke, I and Liusha will leave for a while, come back to us. The Nolander plane will go, but will come back soon. When I come back again, I will bring back some powerful magic items and equipment. But all my army and subordinates will stay in Faro, you know, I am now and The red Cossack is a deadly enemy. So during the time of leaving, I hope that you can help me take care of the subordinates and territories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf sinks and says: "My private territory is not bordered by blood-staining land, so it is difficult to go deep. Red Cossack, let me think about it... Yes, their true supporters behind the scenes should be the Marquis of the Iron Triangle Empire. This is a very Difficult opponents, so my suggestion is that you can shrink the army to the jazz collar I have assigned to you. Don't worry about Baron Little Fang, I will let the Moon Bear carry his knight on your territory. One solution is to let the moon bear stay in the blue water oasis city for a while, but not . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp too long "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
