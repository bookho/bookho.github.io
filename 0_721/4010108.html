			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the army is the hen’s nest, now Richard finally understands why Vatican It will be said that the mother's nest is a weapon of plane war. For the consideration of the plane war, Richard decided to maximize the ability of the hen to create war units. There is a mother's nest, and sooner or later, there will be an innumerable army in the hands of Richard. Why bother to let the mother's nest personally go into battle? As it turns out, as long as the number of elite fighters is sufficient, the difference between the two levels is not too great. Richard can rely on the army in his own hands to survive and kill each other's strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Odom is also a strong man in the sanctuary, if he can use his terrain to trap his mobility, the use of the staff Interference, and then use the humanoid warrior, surrounded by a range of long-range attackers, killing and killing dozens of soldiers can make him drink on the spot. What's more, Richard's humanoid warrior is also mixed with many elite warriors, more experienced and killing many free Archimonde fighters, and Free Archimonde is also equipped with magic tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the army, you must think of command. The ability to bring Richard's commanding power to Richard is a windfall. At least so far, Richard has not met anyone who can match himself in tactical command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the wisdom talent was upgraded again, Richard felt that tracking and directing fifty goals at the same time was the limit, even if the second consciousness was used, at most Add five teams. This has already begun to appear difficult in commanding the battle of the 10,000-level level, and the commanding sophistication has led to a decline in the overall mastery. The best scale is actually an elite battle of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated thoughts, Richard finally determined his style of war. That's the wolf tactics, controlling the size of each battle, and then weakening the powerful opponents through a series of endless battles, and eventually eating the opponent. Richard does not need to play more and less, one to one is enough. In this way, we can best use our advantage of being invincible in the regional battlefield command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, finally reached the most important part, then Richard's own strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main position of Richard is a magician and a builder. The personal strength is mainly based on magic. The blood ability includes the blood of Akmon and the blood of the elves. The blood of the elves is divided into five categories: nature, recovery, monthly force, magic star and elemental ability. In the past, he was able to awaken what kind of blood ability is completely looking at luck, but now it is different, the dark blue series of meditation can selectively strengthen the blood, which makes Richard more choices. The meditation from the legendary mage is really powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now placed in front of Richard is to prioritize which blood is to be strengthened. The main function of restoring focuses on healing a type of effect, and the element greatly enhances the magical power associated with the element. But when Richard looked at it, he first gave up the two blood. There is no need to say recovery, but there are many ways to increase the power of magic. Elements are just one of them, and they are not irreplaceable. Stars that can improve blood circulation are extremely limited, and they cannot be used on average. One day in the future, when Richard’s magic reaches its peak, it may be time to consider the elemental blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the monthly force is mainly awakened by the elf sword used by Richard to learn, the more the monthly force is motivated, the stronger the power of the secret sword will be. For Richard, this is not a must. Nature is different, it will not only increase the power of Richard's natural summoning spells, but also enable Richard to better integrate with the surrounding environment, especially in the environment of forests and grasslands. This bloodline enhances Richard's perception, movement speed, and resonance with real talent. Moreover, Richard’s growing instinct for danger comes from the natural blood. These seemingly inconspicuous nuances are the way to improve the power. They are combined and can be much more useful than simply improving the power of fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it is the magic star. Now there are two new branches on the trunk of the magic star, each with a young leaf. Richard has already experienced the power of the magic star blood and the deep blue meditation. So now he puts all the stars that can be captured into the blood of the magic star, even if it is temporarily advanced to slow down the magic does not matter. It is worthwhile to give up all other bloodlines by simply using the magic star blood to permanently increase the speed of the magical advancement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Io said, the level is the real strength. However, Richard believes that when the blood of the magic star is strengthened to a certain extent, it will definitely give Iraq and Russia a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, it’s Akmon’s blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Richard has a headache. The dark red, the inner mesh resembles a dense network of lava flowing, as if there are infinite secrets. So far, Richard's luck is quite good. Among the two bloody abilities that have been awakened, the outbreak is no problem, but the heat is absolutely strong. But Richard did not know what the third blood capacity would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of abilities in the blood of Akmon, and the blaze is definitely a powerful ability. But the power and the weak ability appear without rules, and everything can only look at luck. In the history of the Archimonde family, there are many examples of the awakening of extremely powerful blood, but have to change jobs. Legend has it that the blood of Archimonde from the devil also inherits the chaotic nature of the devil, and no one knows what kind of power will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard suddenly thought of a problem. I don’t know what Gordon’s blood ability is. It seems that I have never heard anyone talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated thoughts, Richard decided to prioritize the magic star. Levels are not omnipotent, but no level is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is a variety of skills like melee. In this respect, Richard is not good at it, and there are many options to choose from, including the Elf Sword, the Dark World Assassination, and the Gods Fighting. However, Richard does not have much time to spend on it. In addition to skill-based martial arts, it is not suitable for him to continue to train to improve meat/body strength. Richard has been thinking for a long time, but he has not gained anything for the time being. His mind suddenly moved, thinking of a fundamental question: What is powerful? What kind of powerful road does he need to go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many strong people in Richard’s life, the most powerful of which is the legendary Master Su Hailun. Su Hailun is always a weird elf. Richard only knows that she is strong, but how strong it is, but some can't see it. The only basis for her judgment is the dark blue sigh of her sixth-order structure. That is the sixth-order construction! Where the dark blue sighs come from, how effective it is, is still a mystery. But the legendary mage is a perfect example of bloody, anti-Japanese, and even talented. According to the information recently learned from the mouth of Nyris, the legendary mage is likely to be against the sky, and it is simply unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after thinking about it, Richard decisively excluded Su Hailun from the learning goal, and her power could not be copied...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s Gordon, Modred, and White Nights. Gordon’s ability is still a mystery to Richard, and he has been instinctively resisting knowing this man’s business. But Richard is very fond of Mr. Modred, who has been picking up himself since childhood. This man has been very silent, but absolutely powerful, although Richard is not sure where he is strong. However, from someone else's private name to Modred, the ‘Devil’ and the tone and manner of his mention can be seen. And among the thirteen knights of Gordon, the other knights are vaguely afraid of Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
