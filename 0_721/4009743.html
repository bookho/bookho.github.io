When Richard left the Black Rose Castle five years ago, it was still a crazy and bold idea to settle in Faust. The Archimonde family has become a regular member of the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy League, the most popular long poems of the poets are always filled with the exciting history of a certain family entering FS. In order to be able to enter the floating world, many families can even plan and prepare for more than a hundred years. After the preparation is complete, there is still a need for a real hero who will emerge to lead the family to break through the blockade. After blood and fire, The long road of life and glory watered into the fascinating world and solidified the foundation for the next few decades. It can be said that every family in the floating world is a living epic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that at Gotton, the centuries-old history has been condensed into three years, and the magnificent poems that have been magnificent and magnificent have become high-spirited and direct. The aria of the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was fifteen years old and officially became a builder at the age of fifteen. It was obvious that Gordon did not ignore him as he was on the surface, but sent Mordred to pick him up to Faust, and he obviously had some plans for his future. From the time when Modred arrived in dark blue, you can know that Gordon is actually familiar with Richard's progress. And Richard has already learned about his father from many aspects, and he has no prior knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon's designated meeting place is Faust, which is not as simple as it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the family of the Holy Alliance, entering the floating world is only the beginning, stepping into the legendary city is just getting the entry ticket for the game of power, wanting Grasping the right to speak has become a member of the top level of the mainland, and there is still a long way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new family that successfully entered Faust will have to face many crowding and intensive attacks in the Ming and Qing Dynasties for at least a decade, even though the old family There will be no such exchanges, but at least it is hidden and considers the reputation. Therefore, the families that have successfully entered the floating world in the past have strong enough allies in the legendary city, so as to ensure that the family that is greatly injured during the stationing process can support the next difficult period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three hundred years, more than fifty-three families have officially recorded the road to the floating world, and 21 of them have successfully arrived. Destination, however, the number of families in the floating world has always maintained the number of fourteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know how many friends of Gordon, but he knew that his enemies must be many. Archimonde, who has just entered the floating world, can be said to be surrounded by all eyes, and everyone who sees it is an enemy. And now only two years have passed, it was supposed to be a difficult time for the Archimonde family, but Gordon was able to send out the most powerful knights to meet himself, and also extremely luxuriously took two costume knights to follow. It can only show that Gordon has successfully stabilized the situation in the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Richard, the news was mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of the dark blue, the team set off from the early morning sun, and went to the evening to rest. The lunch was on the horse's back in the water bag. The cold water licked a few mouthfuls of dry food. After more than ten hours of trekking, Richard has more than three hundred kilometers from the dark blue, and not far from the front is the reserved rest of Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small, unnamed town that is quite prosperous because of its proximity to the largest highway in the Empire. There are fewer than 100 households in the town, but there are as many as six hotels, apparently relying on this road to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-distance riding is very exhausting, so when the horse walks into the flat and solid road of the town, Richard’s face is also tired, but his eyes are still Smart, the whole person still seems to be energetic. The armored horse, which is known for its explosive power, was not good at long journeys, but after running for a day, it was still stable and full of spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred and the two-build knights have nothing to do with the departure of the morning. When they need it, they can keep running at the highest speed for one day and one night. This journey is nothing. However, the two costume knights now look at Richard's eyes but have more appreciation. Modred praised and said: "Richard, the horse is good, you are not bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all know that Richard is now just a level 8 magician, and the magician is synonymous with physical weakness. Of course, this is not to say that the magician's body is really bad, but it is weak compared with the comrades. It is much stronger than the average person. The more advanced the magician, the stronger the body is. However, Richard has only eight levels, and the limited magic makes it difficult for him to bless the state-enhanced magic for a long time, such as the power of the bull, the agility of the wind, etc., so it is difficult to use much magic in a long day of travel. the power of. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day of travel, in order to save time or other reasons, they left the road halfway, choosing a shortcut that runs through the hills and streams, and the bumps are not Under the words. Richard, who didn't use any gain magic, should have been exhausted, but now he still looks like he is still working. Obviously his body is much stronger than the same level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to training Richard’s actual combat ability, Modred is also prepared to temper his physique and perseverance, but obviously, the original plan The 100-kilometer distance is somewhat underestimated. However, after five years of careful training by the legendary Master, it is not surprising that all aspects of physical fitness are strong. After all, the masters of the dark blue are known as strong bears, but how can an iron armor be so endurable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred looked at Richard’s armored horse again, and suddenly he looked, said: “Lee, you have added this armored horse to the armor. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! It is a preliminary structure that can reduce physical exertion and improve recovery speed, and vitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vibrance? I don't seem to have heard of this structure?" Modred asked a bit strangely. As a high-level knight, even if it is not made, the knowledge of the structure is not too good. For general construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a standard build, but I refer to some magic and the principles of magic, designed by myself." Said, Richard rolled up his right hand The sleeves, at his upper arm, have a complex and beautiful pattern. "Look, I have added a vitality to myself, which will speed up my recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you install one that can improve your combat effectiveness? For example, those that can attach a super magic effect?" Modred frowned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the future." Richard said, "Vigor can give me more time to study and cultivate magic, in the long run to the whole The strength of the improvement is even greater. When I can carry more structures in the future, I will consider the structure of improving my combat effectiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
