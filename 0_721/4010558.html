			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President’s Highness is ready to prepare a piece for every legendary mage in the association Armed with magic, this is a weapon for the Master to save his life, even if it is not used for a while, it is good to keep it at hand, but he is afraid to say this idea, he will scare Richard back, so first make a pair Very embarrassing expression, indicating that the association’s current stock of sacrifices is not “too much”, but it can be paid to Richard in advance, as “predetermined”, which is in line with the mind of Li, so the two sides hit it off and quickly negotiated, and Richard Through the eternal dragon temple, about the time to see Vatican in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Richard brought all the sacrifices he had made, and walked into the long-range transmission line to Fused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Faust, Richard first met with the Duke of Iron and Blood, and the Iron and Blood Duke can be said to be the big man in the league after Philip, as a real strength. The Duke, the iron and blood big public leader's strength far exceeds the ordinary human small kingdom, and the traditional Principality is not the same language. Hearing that Richard seeks to see, the iron and blood is to be rejected, because he and a person just returned from the outside plane. The legendary mage had a lunch, but I heard that Richard was standing in front of the floating island, and Dagong decided to see him. Even in the Holy Alliance, Richard is now a considerable weight, especially him. Still young and with unlimited potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Iron Duke’s living room is unique, there is no extra decoration here, the whole room is made of steel, but there is a strip of dark red The ribbon is faintly scented, and everything in this living room is made of steel. There is no exception. When Richard just sat down, he felt the room was full of bloody, gloomy and The taste of killing can not help but frown slightly, and the light in the eyes circulates. Under the insight, I can see that there are faint figures in the living room, and there will be souls in this living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jagged Big Duke just walked into the living room at this time. He seemed to know what Richard was thinking. When he entered the door, he said, "There is a family of iron blood family in this living room." The spirit exists, so it is also known as the English Hall. Only the truly important guests will enter this living room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Duke looks like Forty years old, his face is sharp and angular. Because of his long thoughts and hard work, he has a lot of Chuanzi in his eyebrows. He has a pair of pale gray eyes, which is very similar to the white night, but it is quite different from Agamemnon. As soon as he entered the door, Richard immediately felt that his body was sinking, and he could not help but be surprised. This is not the intention of the Grand Duke to oppress, but the real talent of Richard has perceived the huge gap between the strengths of the two sides, and thus caused the instinct to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the Grand Duke, he followed a middle-aged mage in a gray robe, and the bald head was the most striking sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the fire of the night, just the end of the ten-year exploration of the plane." After the introduction of the Duke of Iron and Blood, he sat down in the chair. Said: "I would like to have lunch with my Royal Highness. Since you insist on seeing me today, see you together. Your Royal Highness is also very interested in the new Quasi-constructionist of the League. Okay, now say Say what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I want to exchange a promise for a top sacrifice."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fire is very interesting, saying: "The promise of a top-level sacrifice is very interesting. Let’s listen, what are you going to promise?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The promise is that I can design a third-order suit for a person you designate and be responsible for making it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fire eyes brightened, and the bald head swept a faint flame. He picked up his slender eyes and stared at Richard, saying: "Good, specially designed The level suit, if it works well, is really worth paying for a top-level offering, but how do you ensure that the word tailor-made can be cashed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Didn't wait for Richard's answer, the next big Duke of the Iron and Blood was talking first: "The ability to make a life-destructive structure, the production ability without doubt, Richard's first installation conference released two sets of suits, There is no need to say the talent in design."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Iron and Blood said that the night fire no longer doubts the ability of Richard, but asks:" Then when will this set be completed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes only three months to get started, from design to completion, it is estimated to be more than a month." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fire nodded and said: "The original is owed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not embarrassed, but very seriously said: "It is true, because I urgently need a lot of sacrifices, it is too late to exchange a little bit. I want to promise to exchange for sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fire did not ask for the purpose of collecting the sacrifices, but the topic turned and asked: "That Before you got here, have you borrowed a sacrifice, and now you have collected a lot of sacrifices. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to hide from Richard. He said: "There are six in total, I originally had one in my own hands, and I borrowed five from the Royal Masters Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The night fire laughed: "Hah, that old man is so generous, this can be a bit of an old-fashioned meaning, well, Orleans, you are going to have a few promises, but I plan to have three, you can't Inserted in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Iron and Blood smiled and said, "I will take one, and the little ones have grown up. Some There is no need to waste resources on them at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three crystals in the palm of your hand, placed on the coffee table in front of you. With a slight push, the three crystals flew to the front of Richard as if they were skating on the ice. They pulled out more than ten shiny silver rays in the air, which is the typical characteristic of Bethel's arachnid. The three spider crystals are worth a little worse than the three top sacrifices, and the key point is the spider crystal. Can be used as a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when the spider crystal started, when Richard looked closely, he was taken aback. Each of the three spider crystals has a rice ball-sized fireball that rotates slowly. Burning, the magic that can't be said, these three are not ordinary arachnids, but mutant arachnids, and even Richard can't recognize which kind of variation they belong to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fire smiled and said: "These three melting arachnids, each one to a top sacrifice, you owe me three promises now." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at the bald legendary mage, who was very puzzled by his refreshment and asked: "You believe me so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally unbelief, but you can get five sacrifices from the Masters Association. I also believe that the more you sacrificed from other people. More, I will dare to lend you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coming out of the floating island of the Duke of Iron and Blood, Richard changed his itinerary and stopped going to Welling. The fort and the Duke of Turan visited, but went directly to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin did not see Richard alone as before, but convened all the 18th-level grand priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall, sitting around Vatican. Eight great priests, Nolan and Greek are also divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a lineup, just the momentum is enough to suppress people from breathless, when Richard entered the hall, the heart actually missed a few shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation can be said to be extremely abnormal. The relationship between Richard and Vatican can be said to be quite close. Every time I meet individually, how can this be done? It was the way to interrogate the prisoner, but Richard determined that he was still in the presence of Vatican. He silently placed the magic box in his hand on the ground and said in a very formal way: "My dear Vatican, I have now An urgent need, I want to get the support of the Eternal Dragon Temple, and the price of asking for help, I have brought it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin has a low eye The high crown on the top of the head does not move, only faintly said: "Is it in that box? Then open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated, just In the face of the eight great priests, they opened the magic box and slammed the light, so that these well-informed large priests also took a breath of air, and the box was full of sacrifices. Most of them are top-level sacrifices. When these sacrifices are put together and placed in the Eternal Dragon Hall, they even cause time. Resonance force, a section of golden time band of light coming from all directions converge, even condense into a large hourglass ghost, constantly flying around Bot box, and disappeared the next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the great priests can look back in the dazzling light, count the number of sacrifices in the magic box, when this number rises At the double digits, more than one big priest felt that his heart had missed a few beats, ten top ceremonies, and the ten honours represented by the top ceremonies were so large that they could make any one present. The level of the gods instantly rises to the level of 20, as long as they successfully acquire the gods in the future, or touch a little time and space rules, they can step into the legendary realm and qualify to host an eternal dragon temple like Vatican alone. The box, in the eyes of a large priest, is tantamount to a step into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Nolan, all the big priests are surging in the waves, and the look of Richard is naturally different, taking out ten pieces at a time. The top sacrifices have not happened in the last 30 years, and regardless of the source of these sacrifices, they can appear in the hands of Richard, which in itself illustrates the ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Vatican’s great priest is unmoved, maybe her eyes have seen some time and space in the future, she said slowly: “Now, say you The need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "In my plane, Green Forest, there is a curse in the face of the demon god, in jeopardy, I hope Eternal Dragon The temple was able to lift this curse and save her. These sacrifices are rewards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
