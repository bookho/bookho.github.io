			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are a group of mad dogs, even if they are head-to-head, they have to rush Take a bite and say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the older guys took two steps forward and slammed the blood-stained nailed stick in his hand and said, "Small Guy, it’s not fun to watch the fun!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s eyes twitched slightly, pointing to the two, faintly saying: “I hate this. Double eyes, and, this old guy obviously lives a little too long!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Li has not fallen, the water has already flashed to the former person, The two fingers were inserted and smashed, and his eyes were dug up. At the same time, the ground vibrates, the ogre is struggling to make a big stride, the heavy hammer is smashing, and the slamming sound is screaming. The old man who wields the wooden stick is hammered onto the wall and becomes a group that can hardly be seen as a human figure. The flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody reality, the other three people finally showed a hint of fear, turned around and ran. However, three bowstrings came from behind, and with the gesture of Richard, Oral had nailed an arrow at the back of each person. One arrow pierced the heart, so the three people did not move immediately after falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few ordinary poor people who originally sat or stood in the alleys slowly stood up. They seemed to be living in a low shack behind them. People, before blindly turning a blind eye to the ongoing atrocities, the tough performance of outsiders seems to have finally touched them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man with a completely gray hair looks at Richard with complex and turbid eyes, slowly saying: "Adult, you have powerful power, but not It should be abused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another strong middle-aged man said sullenly: "Here is the domain of Hoven, these people are also the authors of Hoven. He can't be irritated!" He said that his hanging hands were clenched in front of his chest, and the knuckles slammed clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t say anything, but just pointed to the middle-aged man, Gangde took a big step and slammed into the middle-aged Face. In front of his hammer-like fist, the middle-aged man's face was quickly distorted and deformed, and a white-red intertwined tooth spouted from his mouth. His strong body flew out, crashed into a wall, and fell into a dark, damp shack, and there was no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde kept his fist and swearing, grinning, until he showed the white teeth to the people around him, he slowly stopped. Back to the team of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes fell on the old man, and the implied sharpness made the other person feel a sting, and he could not help but step back two steps. At this time, Richard said faintly: "The use of power is to dig up its eyes when the mad dogs dare to glare at you. If any mad dog wants to bite me, then I will kill all the dogs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the old man’s shack and said: "In my opinion, you are all mad dogs, no difference. Now Those who dare not come out in the shack are human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the scorpion Hoven....." Richard looked at the shack where the middle-aged man was planted. Said: "He is really not good, but I am even less irritated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who else wants to say anything?" Richard's gaze sweep Throughout the slums, this time everyone has subconsciously avoided his gaze, and no one dares to speak out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the Bloodstone Camp, Richard chose a good hotel. This hotel is located within the control of the Thunderbolt, which is obviously safer than other areas. The half-orc tribe is the creator of this camp, which means that in most cases, they will also be the firm defenders of order. Of course, its price also exceeds the service provided. With a total of twenty temple gold coins, Richard has wrapped the entire hotel for twenty days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloodstone Camp has hotels, barracks, casinos, and pubs and other facilities in other settlements. In addition, there are more than a dozen. The slave camp and a arena that can accommodate hundreds of spectators. This arena is the biggest entertainment for people in the Bloodstone Camp and the largest source of wealth for Thunderbolts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days happened to be the opening time of the arena, so after dinner, Richard took everyone and went to the arena to watch the game. There are both slaves in the battlefield, as well as warriors specially dispatched by various forces. Therefore, it has become a place for the factions of various factions to resolve disputes with each other. And Richard hopes to see the strength of the soldiers in the bloodstone camp through the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the price of two gold coins, Richard wrapped two boxes adjacent to the second floor. When he was seated, the entire arena was almost full. There is no seat on the first floor of the arena. All the people are standing, crowded with each other, and the loud and noisy sounds almost open the top cover of the arena. At this moment, the degree of air pollution in the arena has reached its peak, but the mixed hormones and bloody thick smells, but also make people inexplicably excited about bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two loud noises in the box on the left hand side of Li, which attracted his attention. A short, stout man was throwing two canes on the guardrail of the stands, then moved his body with his hands, threw himself into a large, comfortable chair, and spit with satisfaction. The crutches were thick and heavy, dark and heavy, and it seemed that the whole roots were cast from steel. Behind the man, he stood a row of elite guards, apparently not weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man turned his head and showed a bright smile to Richard, saying, "My name is Hoven, but everyone here calls me a blind man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard, Richard Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovin is still smiling. Q: "It turns out that Mr. Richard, I don't know where you are from? If I am not mistaken, you should be a respected nobleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said indifferently: "My family does have a title, but since I came to this land, I know that the nobility title is useless. I have no intention of getting something with the noble title. What I want. "Go with a sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks well!" Hoven praised a few words and said: "On this damn red land, only Speak with your fists and knives. Those nobles who come here will probably become robbers or alien looters. But your guards look very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not like it, it’s really amazing. They also tried a little bit this afternoon and cleaned up a few mad dogs.” Richard smiled. correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? It’s a coincidence, I just lost a few mad dogs!" Hoven laughed, then the fierce flash in his eyes, don’t mean to say "Is it so clever that Mr. Richard can give me an explanation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
