			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people walked silently, this time it was safe and sound, then There is no hunter to provoke Richard, and the elf hunter who lost the longbow is particularly white, because the longbow is half of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was insulted, and the Elf hunter lost the longbow. In the eyes of the guardian elf, the loss of the two is quite equal, and I have to admit that the guardian spirit They are all very dignified races, but they don’t know that when the elf hunters are bowing, Richard is deliberately not hiding. Otherwise, it’s not that the hunters are not skilled in swinging, that is, they are the most Do not want to be able to touch Richard's clothes corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the reason for this, it is only for Melin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a huge canopy of the tree of life in the distance. This hundred-meter-high behemoth can be seen from far away, and the huge canopy is like a thick green Juyun, faintly floating above the forest, proudly overlooking the surrounding, where the sights are, can be said that there is no rival, of course, this is also because within the scope of a tree of life, there will be no other strain The tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the tree of life, Richard’s heart naturally has no shadows that are unprovoked, and in fact there is no shadow, the canopy of this tree of life, It’s really beautiful, like a girl’s pretty hips, sexy in the eyes of Richard, or an adjective. It’s like a huge gold coin tilted at an angle. Of course, although gold is not a valuable thing, Quantitative change will cause qualitative change. The huge gold coin with a diameter of more than one kilometer is still worth a lot of money. Such a huge value can be easily converted into other things, such as the number of sacrifices, such as the number of top materials. For example, the number of pure girls...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at this moment, Richard’s mood is finally a lot more beautiful, and this tree of life is just the beginning, Melin said, She remembers the location of the nine tribes, nine tribes, that is, nine life trees, maybe there are world trees, Richard is not going to provoke the world tree, but it is very possible to get a few life trees. In fact, it is related to Melin, which is about ten tribes, including the Yongye tribe itself, but Richard thinks that the Yongyue tribe is quite special. The real speciality is of course not mentioned now. The only reason that can be found is only the tribe. The name is nothing, but what about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie thinks that he is quite a big family business nowadays. It is also a good thing to raise a tree of life. The two trees are also raised, and there is no big deal. From the perspective of the superiors, it may be a good thing that the life tree of the company has competition. If you only keep a tree of life, it will feel that the whole world of Green Forest is not your own. In the future, it will inevitably be arrogant and arrogant. At that time, it will be more troublesome. It’s still a small matter. It’s a big deal to do things. Now, this life tree is still pretty good. It’s especially rare to know how to be interested, but this is just a matter of adding, not something that Richard thinks necessary, in other words. A tree of life that doesn't know how to brag about horses may not be a good tree, but it is certainly not a good tree to know the tree of life that brags the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not shoot, light can not do, this is Richard's definition of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf hunters who are escorted and actually escorted are quite disdainful of Richard’s ease, especially the pleasure that Richard clearly reveals. I was thinking: "Wait until the tribe, some of the elders are packing you up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They consciously escorted the prey of the hound, although it was Richard Little I learned a bit, but I still kept the fangs and claws down. However, they did not know that it was not a wolf, but a tyrannosaurus that was ready to swallow them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, this tyrannosaurus is still very tame. There are only two situations in which tyrannosaurus suffers from small animals. One is when eating too much, the other is when Waiting for a big meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the tree of life, the treatment of Melin and Richard immediately differentiated, and a team of savvy and capable elf hunters jumped from the tree of life flexibly and vigorously. Surrounded by a young elf Druid, although young, but this elf actually wearing the big Druid's suit color, he greeted me directly to Melin, smiled and said: "Meilin, finally waiting for you, I know that you are having some trouble on the road. I always want to pick you up, but I am always stopped by the old people. Fortunately, you have nothing to do. Now all the elders are in the tree of life. After a ceremony, you can Immediately hold the Presbyterian Church to discuss the cooperation between Aoba and Yongye tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the young Druid opposite, Melin looks relaxed, said "Yanlu, thank you for your enthusiasm, I can go to the tree of life to wait for the elders now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Druid led Merlin to the tree of life, but Richard did not receive this treatment. A row of elf hunters was tacitly stopped in front of Richard, the holy tree of all guardian elves. Unable to be tainted by outsiders, Richard is an outsider after all. This is the first impression of the elves' stubbornness. Not to mention that he can mobilize the forces of nature. It is useless to grow a few branches of the tree of life. All stubborn people. All have the same characteristics, that is, the focus of the line of sight is quite narrow, only to see a little, you can no longer see other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not care about the significant difference in treatment, even when he did not see the apparent hostility of the Elf Hunters, letting several hunters send themselves to the Tree of Life. There is a big tree at the edge of the shade. There is a simple wooden house under the tree. It is the place where Richard wants to stay. Richard does not stay in the tree house, but leans on the big tree and constantly looks into the distance. The tree of life only flashed a glimmer of light in the depths of the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few elf hunters not far away glanced at Richard with a vigilant gaze, and Richard occasionally thought about something, walking around the big tree, these Elf hunters do not interfere, and the concept of the guardian elves is different from that of human beings. Instead of demarcating the roof and the door, the land is defined by the periphery of the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not at all leisurely. In front of this tree of life, he is more mature than the whole of his hand. The life is full of energy, with insight. If you can see that there is a pale, light green life and natural atmosphere floating in the surrounding space, and these energies are incomparably pure. After many years of accumulation, there is almost no impurity. It can be seen at a glance. The point of the rule, and the body of the tree of life, in the eyes of Richard is simply a huge green light, looking at the past, it is everywhere rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rare experience of the life tree, Richard has long built a relatively complete framework model. All that is needed now is time, if time is unlimited, Li If the life of the inspection is infinite, then all the rules except the underlying rules can be deduced. This is a huge project, but there is no shortcut. For example, now is a shortcut, and you can see the natural tree of life. The surging and running of power, the natural understanding of the rules is much faster than the wisdom of the talents. The specific speed is roughly equivalent to one hundred and one hundred. Looking at the whole day here is equivalent to analyzing one hundred days. When Richard looked at it, he felt that a new rule would come to the surface. This is the first thousand and twenty-three rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich is quite looking forward to the 1 0/24 rule, because at this time, whether it is a common rule or an underlying rule, The overall understanding of this rule will be elevated to a whole new level. If he can be quietly watching the tree of life for a few days, the first zero-two rule should be released, but now Richard has to give up this. Opportunity, my heart is slightly regrettable, because at this time, Richard also listened to the Presbyterian Church of the Aoba tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
