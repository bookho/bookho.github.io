			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to simplifying the design, the Thunder Hammer does not know the magic at all. In the eyes of common sense amateurs, a magical pattern with a magical crystal and a metal-inlaid technique is much more advanced than a simple Warcraft skin. Although the latter represents the true level of plug-in. The structure directly painted on the body, for example, the magical increase of Richard's drawing of the sand is the essence of the magic pattern. However, the structure of the drifting sand seems to be as simple as a tattoo, and there is rarely a strong light and shadow effect when excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard does not want to show the essence of the magic pattern on the Thunderbolt. In this plane without the magic pattern, the increase is 20%. It is shocking to bring people, and the 40% increase is still shocking. Instead of increasing the increase to 40%, while increasing the cost by nearly 6 times and 8 times the production time, it is better to add some elements that look more 'powerful', 'exquisite', 'complex' and so on. Care about whether these elements have a substantial effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard who has studied art in depth, it is not difficult to design these points. The extra time and effort are almost negligible, and maybe even corresponding Reduce complexity, And his elf blood has also played a potential role. In the history of Noland, the elves are indeed unique races in making all kinds of slick items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Faro plane, the power bursting of these 'sparkling elements' has been added, and the power of increasing the growth rate from 20% to 40% has broken out. The price can be the same, or even higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These extra art designs are certainly not meaningless. From the previous trophies seized, the magicians of this plane seem to be happy to use them. Different visual effects to show the status, magic products such as staff, scrolls, enchanted weapons and other magical and exquisite, fully embodies the identity of high-end products. So for the thunder hammer, even for those who have seen most of the magic items, this composition is beautiful and can clearly see the structure of the magic crystal running. It is undoubtedly a very advanced one, fully in line with the price of 10,000 gold coins. Products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dinner arrives, when the sand hits the door, the power burst of Richard’s power is coming to an end. This thing, which was not counted in Noland's defective products, was sold at a high price equivalent to Noland's 400,000 gold coins, and it only took 3 hours and less than one. Raw materials for thousands of gold coins. There is also an hour of design time in 3 hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strength of Gangde’s body broke out, but it took Richard a week, and the cost of various materials exceeded 50,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the sand fell to the work that Richard had just finished, and immediately whispered: "This thing... this structure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very crude, right?” Richard laughed and said, “The Thunder hammer doesn’t need to be done so well. It’s ok to achieve the effect he wants. Anyway, he only needs 5 minutes to upgrade the equivalent of the first-order ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded, but the eyes fell on the freshly baked structure. It is difficult to remove. In fact, there is no other reason, but this structure is too simplistic, and Richard's previous works are not like the same person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flow of sand, all the beautiful and useless light and shadow effects, complex patterns are not good at all, even a bunch of redundancy that needs to be cleaned up. I only think that the main body of the structure is simple and clear. It is the perfection in her eyes to achieve the maximum effect with the least strokes. It’s just that it’s simple, the line stripe is still accurate, and it shows a little personal style of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing sand certainly knows that Richard’s approach is correct, but looking at such a work that seems to be deliberately painted by a master as a children’s graffiti, the awkwardness of the heart is always difficult to wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally settled her mind and asked: "What is the cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand Gold coins are not available," Richard said easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really cheap...there is such a cheap build!” Flowing sand is indeed a surprise. In Noland, any one of the frames is often ten. Ten thousand gold coins start at the price. It seems that this deal with Thunder Hammer, Richard is indeed making a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the strength increase?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Active burst type, you need to insert a magic crystal , the increase is about 20%." Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand understands that this is the fighting power that Richard wants to control the Thunder Hammer, but it is a powerful fighter of the 14th level, which can also be placed in the army in Noland. The middle-ranking middle-ranking officer was deserved. I really want to add him to the structure, but it becomes a knight. With the current ability of the Richards team, a standard four-level base knight can sweep their entire team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree with Richard’s practice from the bottom of my heart, this figure is still extremely dazzling in the eyes of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a certainty, and the sands opened the scroll box with the magic seal effect, revealing the three scrolls inside, saying: "This is me. The magic scrolls prepared by the Thunderbolt are blessing, primary divine defense, and a healing spell, which can be activated by ordinary warriors. The healing is a three-level scroll."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic scroll?" This time it was Richard’s turn to exclaim. Then I blamed the sand with a blame and said, "I don't need a hammer for such a precious thing? You are not afraid that he took the reel and turned over to deal with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you taking a closer look?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully opened the reel of healing and observed it. He is a master of the magical array, and his ability to perceive has already reached the level of master. At first glance, he found that the material of the reel did not shrink, but it was indeed a genuine one or two reel, but the supernatural power attached to it was pitiful. Moreover, the structure of the magic is also different from normal, especially one of the very small and inconspicuous changes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s question, the quicksand said: These reels are all modified from the magic scroll of the god of courage. The three magical effects are complete, but the magical power I attach to it is only used to start the reel. The real drive will be the thunder hammer itself. The vitality of the three reels from level 1 to level 3 requires one to three years of life. If the thunder hammer uses all three reels, he is equivalent to an old man for six years. The life is usually shorter. I have already asked that the life of a half-orc is generally only fifty years old, and it is rare to live to be sixty years old. The thunder hammer is over forty years old, and six years less life, his Fighting power will inevitably drop sharply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took a sigh of relief and carefully took the reels carefully, lest he accidentally triggered. He paid a huge price to get twenty years of extra life from the Eternal Dragon Hall. If he lost six years because he started several reels, he could cry and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, these three insidious sacred scrolls are also taken from the magic scrolls of the god of courage, even the gods of the outer cover and the god of courage The sign is always in good condition. No, the sand will definitely not forget this detail, but it should be deliberately preserved. In the eyes of others, it means that the god of courage will pay a very high price, and the cost is obviously taken away by the god of courage. As for the god of courage, the scroll of magic can only be restricted by the priests. In the face of facts, people will not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
