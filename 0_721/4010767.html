Although it is important to rob the dragon, it is also important to take a look at the plane belonging to Xiao Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the legendary mage is indeed extremely fast, the momentum is unparalleled, even the most ordinary people can find the strangeness in the sky, not to mention Those who are strong, but now the Farosi continent is the eventful autumn. Most of the strong people choose to protect themselves, only to see the momentum in the air, many strong people will naturally choose to turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when Su Hailun passed the Principality where the brave wind was prevailing, several township strongmen took advantage of the crowd and ignorance, and they actually lifted up to see them. Of course, even the shadow of Su Hailun was not clearly seen. However, one of the strong men was too close to the location where the legendary mage flashed, and the result was engulfed by the explosion of residual magical energy, which was instantly burned by the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the magic wave left behind has such power. These so-called strong people know that they are powerful, and they are all in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon plane, Carolol has waited a little impatient, although it’s less than half an hour before entering Palau’s portal, but It feels like it has been half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the portal suddenly fluctuated, Carroll couldn’t help but breathe out, but it wasn’t Palau that came out of the portal, but the dragon enslaver Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dragons are a lazy expression, and some even stretched directly and yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days they have seen hundreds of 'strong', these strong will also burst into momentum, and put on all kinds of signs Starting position, but the so-called killing, no matter how arrogant, will always stay at the beginning of this stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon enslaver Su Hailun has appeared less, but he has been there twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons have learned a lot during this time, and when they see the strong those who appear in these legends, they know that they are definitely fake. When human beings who cannot be named at all are present, they are really dangerous. Moreover, after so many days, don't say that Richard, that is, his followers have already mixed up in the dragon circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the legendary wizard came out of the portal, he suddenly saw the dragon full of eyes, and was suddenly overwhelmed by great joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, her mood is like a mouse that fell into the rice cylinder. In addition to turning it over, I can't think of anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Su Hailun’s eyes were swept away, he saw that the dragon’s group suddenly became full of temperament, squatting under the armpits, dozing off, and sleeping. There are even one male and one female dragons twisting their buttocks and slowly crawling behind the hills in the distance. Obviously they have no plans to do good things. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on the fire, there is actually a group of ordinary dragons who can no longer be ordinary, surrounded by the offensive posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s eyebrows suddenly stood up, she was already famous in the depths of the plane, it was all famous, and now it’s the dragon. The plane, this group of stupid dragons actually sent only dozens of ordinary soldiers to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say ordinary people, even if this team is a sanctuary strong, in the eyes of the legendary mage are all dishes, like her attack power is super strong, and The strong man with a large-scale attack is not afraid of siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons’ actions were the same as the legendary Master’s middle finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is not the kind of person who will first explain the theory and have patience. The small face is sinking, the hands are pulled, and a huge portal between the fingers is already childlike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons have come down with the spirit, they have paid attention to them, and they have been talking about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎呦This is done exactly the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, expressions and looks are very realistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to put magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really magical, it’s really good, this time it’s really good, this magic It’s pretty good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it a portal, is my eyes spent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's really interesting, the portal can be squeezed like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are suddenly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just the scream of the dragon suddenly broke the silence: "That is the real portal, the plane portal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons blasted the pot and slammed into the air, flew to the sky, and a few smart ones flew to the ground, not crowded with the brigade. Even the dragons rushed to the ground and fled directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult dragons are mostly mobile, they know exactly what an unstable portal means, not to mention that it is connected to a space outside the plane. Plane portals, the power of such portals to blast dozens of times larger than ordinary portals, and the most deadly is the space cracks that may occur during the explosion. These gaps are also the strongest dragons. Can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolves escaped the dragons and almost dared not to think back to the scene just now, the imposing woman actually dared to fold the portal into the same way, actually able to put the portal It’s like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s face is sneer and shouted: “Want to run, it’s late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted her hands over the top and threw her hands out like a throwing stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a huge fireball appeared in the air, numerous dragons on the edge of the fireball were blown by the gale, and there were strong dragons in the Desperate to fly far away to avoid the flames and shock waves from the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge fireball slowly rises and spreads, gradually becoming a mushroom cloud that almost occupies a panoramic view of the dragon's eye. It seems to be slow because it is too It’s huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dragon is not completely unrestrained, and a dragon is almost flying close to the lower edge of the huge fireball, rushing through the flames, toward Su Hailun attacked it, it was Carol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was burned by flames in a dragon scale, and it was slightly reddened, and its defense power did not change. Instead, it increased its attack power because of high heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Carcaroll, there are more than a dozen dragons who have turned around and attacked Su Hailun. These dragons are famous powerful players, dealing with a legend. Master, it is absolutely stupid to escape in the range of her long-range magic attack, only the offense is defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge mushroom cloud is still rising, and the surrounding dragons have recovered their balance one by one, and some have already re-flyed to the sky, only a few weak Falling to the ground, they are either weak or too close to the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the more than ten dragons that were directly rushed by the fireball, less than half died on the spot, and the mighty body of the dragon was evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several rounds of horror, the dragons joined the siege of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Carroll, the dragons at the core crowded into a ball, and all kinds of dragons and bites almost filled. In every space, the outer dragon has not found the space to be inserted into the battle group, and can only fly around the outer circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle at the center was extremely fierce. From time to time, there was a dragon who was thrown out of the battle group and then turned to the earth to fall and was thrown out. Although the dragons are not dead, but all have broken bones, this kind of injury is not fatal to the extremely powerful dragon, but it is enough to make them lose their ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons on the periphery couldn’t see the war, but when they saw the twisted limbs of the dragons, the dragon wings that were pulled, but they were also frightened. They couldn’t imagine it. How could such a petite human being be on the dragon? Hit this kind of injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the damage of magic or sharp weapon, but the injury that is completely violently beaten. Is such a small woman able to overwhelm the power? Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the war, when Su Hailun threw out the space bursting, the dragons were scared and scared, if not Carroll took the lead, Other dragons are likely to smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation seems to have firmly suppressed the little woman, but the dragon that is constantly being thrown is still a keen mind for some minds and observing meticulous dragons. Frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons thrown out are roughly in the same area, and they almost lost their ability to move after landing. They can only lie on the ground and wailing, still besieging They are all ordinary dragons, and they are thrown out with rare and powerful varieties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky suddenly caught a large burning fire cloud, and a crimson dragon lingering around the blazing flame came from the fire cloud, its The shape is huge, from the beginning to the end of the length of nearly a kilometer, all the dragon scales are sprayed outwards, and the breath is even more pure dragon flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation Dragon Bahamut, like the evil dragon Tiamat, is one of the top presences of this plane, its appearance, suddenly Let the dragons in the room be excited. In the heart of the dragon, since the dragon of inflammation has arrived, the situation will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Dragon of Fire was just on the scene, it was immediately a scream of exclamation: "Su Hailun, the dragon enslaver Su Hailun."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons suddenly panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of dragons, if the reputation is loud, it is natural to have the title of Dragon Slayer and Dragon Slavery. They have seen these days. More legendary powerhouses, all of them are fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of this woman, although the fighting power is amazing, but the dragons will still subconsciously think that her appearance is disguised, but Bahamut accurately identified it, then She is really Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
