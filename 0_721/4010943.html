			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a dazzling list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials, strengthen the various planes, ten years of life, and more are all kinds of equipment. As long as it is a legendary and quasi-legendary level of equipment, Richard does not look at it and exchange it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragon seems to be ignoring him, the number of equipment in the list is surprisingly large, and there are a large number of quasi-legendary suits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of suits can be split into Archimonde's point redemption system, which will undoubtedly increase the appeal of the system. After all, only a handful of talents are eligible to compete for the Midrande combat version of the suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has chosen this one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive sacrifices were put on the altar and turned into the power of time, and then condensed into grace. At the foot of Richard, all kinds of equipment have piled up like mountains. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the channel passages in the Jinjin Valley and the meteorite highlands have also been strengthened once. Now, if you enter and exit the soldiers above the fifteenth level, it is no longer a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is very mechanical. When Richard put the last two top sacrifices together on the altar, the long list in front suddenly changed slightly. The new option jumped into Richard's eyes and turned him into a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a special grace, a Richard never thought of the grace that would exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God transmission: dark areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he had all sorts of emotions, but nothing. When his finger touches the commentary, it is exceptionally stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grace will form a plane portal that can send a person directly to a dark area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portal is incredibly powerful and extremely stable. It clearly identifies the non-destructible, unstoppable genus and can be applied in any environment or under any circumstances. In other words, even if Richard is in the most intense battle, he can release it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the grace transmission occurs, Richard will immediately be in the same unharmable state as the plane portal. Until he completes the transfer, there will be no power to hurt him unless the opponent's power level is above the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there is indeed a stronger presence in the world than the Eternal and Time Dragon, but at least so far, the Nolanders have not found such a presence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Li is most concerned about is the destination of the grace, the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark area is mysterious, it is the place where the eternal and the dragon of time shines. There is no such thing as a world in which the outer domain is a law of chaos, nor a single world in which the major elements are dominated by elemental laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to tell what is in the dark area, what it is, and no one even knows where the dark area is. This is a very strange thing. People simply refer to the world outside the eternal and time-honored region as the dark region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the sands went to the dark areas, Richard investigated a lot of information about the dark areas, in the hope that one day the time will mature, go to the unknown world Flowing sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what surprised him was that he had rummaged through all the information he could find, and Richard did not find a way to go to the dark areas. Even Su Hailun is ignorant of the dark areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the list of gods, actually provides a passage to the dark areas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the following few pages of explanations and took a deep breath and continued reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transferred to dark areas, even for the Eternal and Time Dragon is a heavy burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the style of the old dragon, the recipient needs to try to establish the order of the dragon of the time in the dark area. Once the new time lighthouse is built, the way to return to the order world will be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles in this are not difficult to understand. The dark area is where the old dragon can't get in. It can throw a person in, but only the person who built the time lighthouse can understand the position of the old dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of time lighthouses shines, which is equivalent to the kingdom of eternal and time dragons. This way the old dragon can pull him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the description, it is specifically stated that the transmission of grace is an ability to be absolutely life-saving. If you want to save your life, you have to pay a considerable price. That is to go to the dark area to open up the land for the old dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t do it, you’re ready to rot in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a question again. That is how big is the dark area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the infinite world of the deep blue, the infinitely inseparable magical philosophy, the darkness is certainly greater than the order of the eternal and timeless dragons. The reason is also very simple, the unknown is definitely greater than known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the sand flowing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not rush to the dark areas, because if I do, I will probably not find the sand, and I will fall into it. This is stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no way, does not mean that there is no way for the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. Since the old dragon put this option in front of his eyes, then there must be a solution. Otherwise, Richard believes that the old dragon knows that he will not enable this grace transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, at the end of the description, there is an option: upgradeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put his hand on this option, and the upgrade content appeared, which is to select a dark area for directional transmission. The dark areas are divided into areas with a name of xìng, in order to correspond to different deities who go to the development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Richard saw the place of dawn in it, which is the area where the sands flow to the development. According to the agreement, when the sand will completely develop the entire place of dawn, it will be able to recover zì yóu. However, in the past history, no one god has succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard no longer hesitated, chose the grace of the transmission, and then upgraded to the designated place to break the dawn. In this way, including the remaining gods before Richard, the grace of all three top sacrifices disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice was over, and the power of time was gradually disappearing, and the altar became a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood here and suddenly felt a lot of heart. There is a small hourglass mark on the back of his right hand, which is the mark of God's grace. With this imprint in the body, Richard is equivalent to one more life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now, the problem before Richard is not a reduction, but more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer young, no longer a bloody teenager. He is now a famous lord of the mainland, with the entire family, many followers relying on him, as well as Su Hailun, Shan and Hai, Qi Qi, Alice, cocoa and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hesitated whether he should leave for the dark areas, Richard suddenly felt very heavy, and that feeling was called responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the words before the run-off, he still clearly remembered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has said that he should not come to her until he defeats the Pope of the Church of Light. At that time, Richard was still wondering how he would have an intersection with the bright church of the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, Li has seen the Pope of the Church of Light and indirectly fought. But the old man gave him a very special feeling, even if he had both wisdom and real vision, he could not see his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Richard thinks that he is just like this, and sometimes he feels unfathomable. But because of St. Martin's side, Richard can do everything and concentrate on dealing with Michael. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Michael also made Richard wonder, the archangel is said to have the super strong, but the real fight, but Richard feels This does not seem to be the case. He is much worse than nothing, and it is even less likely to compare with Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just that Michael's structure is suppressed by his Midrand? If Richard made it possible to have a full sixth-order version of Midarun, it was only a combat version, and Richard did not think that he could suppress Michael to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts of Richard are pulled back from the drift and go outside the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest who stood at the door of the temple looked at Richard. There were countless emotions in his eyes, and he could not describe what it was. She suddenly plunged into Richard's arms and kissed his lips hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not entangle her with her, patted her back and gently pulled her away. Then said: "This ceremony is good, I am very satisfied. I will come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting for you, Your Highness!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the sacrifice of the Eternal Dragon Hall was a great harvest, and Richard almost got everything he wanted, and there was a big surprise. So harvested, even he himself is somewhat unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Eternal and Time Dragon still thinks he is very useful, so he is willing to help him. Judging from this sudden transmission of grace, the dragon of eternal and time seems to be ready to invest in dark areas to develop. As for why I saw the Richard who is not a god, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard let the knights pack the equipment of the grace of the gods, and set off for the black rose castle. This time he got a total of five legendary equipment, nearly 20 pieces of quasi-legendary equipment, and four sets of quasi-legendary suits. This is enough to support the three-point redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the castle, the first thing Richard did was to start a remote communication with St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Saint Martin’s figure appeared in the magical image, and the Son seems to have been very well mixed recently, with a smile on his lips. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met, Martin said, "Dear Richard, I know that you have no good things when you come to me. Let me say, what do you want to do this time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and asked: "What do you think I am going to challenge the Pope now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin was shocked and asked: "Are you crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I am not crazy! But tell me your judgment What kind of result would it be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked at Richard carefully and always felt that Richard was drinking too much. If it is not the telematics magic array that can not transmit the smell, he may have to rush to smell if there is alcohol in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
