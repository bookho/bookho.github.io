			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battlefield suddenly vibrated a bit, a circle of earth waves to Richard and Kay Le is the center, and it spreads in all directions. In a blink of an eye, it spreads to the military arrays of both sides. For a time, the Brahms warriors are turned upside down and chaotic. The quality of Archimonde warriors is significantly higher, but many people are shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest of the two sides can barely see the action of Richard. Richard stepped deep into the ground, and after Keller pressed into the earth, he naturally stood up and took a leisurely shot of the dust on his hand. The whole movement was like a flowing stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in the center of the battlefield, there is a shallow pit with a radius of nearly 100 meters. A crack at the edge of the pit is shot in all directions, and the center of the pit, Keller It was embedded in the earth in a large font and looked dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his only consciousness, he only felt as if he had been stepped on by the ancient Titans, and he slammed it a few times. How can such power appear in humans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha held his hand, raised his right hand, made two circles in the air, and then pointed to the opposite Brahms army. So the Archimonde warriors rolled across the sides of Richard and rushed to the army of Brahms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Keller was carried by several guards and returned to the Dragon Wing Castle. He leaned up to the sky and kept talking to himself: "Impossible! How can there be such a great power! This is impossible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marquis of Brahms was so gloomy as to drip out the water, and saw that his first battle would become like this, and he suddenly lost all his temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis just stood quietly in front of Keller, listening to his crazy proverb. He knows Keller very well, and knows that Keller has retired several times against the legendary strongman, and even when there is no downwind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Keller’s expedition, the Marquis had conceived the worst case, but it was just death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde family, after all, only has a legendary mage, which is the biggest flaw. When the heavenly sanctuary is against the heavenly sanctuary, Keller’s talent and combat experience are often cheap. But now looking at Keller's look is obviously worse than the death of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis took a deep breath and asked, "How is his injury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest of a bright church immediately went to the front and then said: All the bones are broken, the internal organs... it’s still good. If it’s treated, it takes at least half a year.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking, this big priest is also A shocked face, able to smash the whole body bones, what kind of power is this? To know that Keller's strongest place is his body, under the protection of the temper, his bone hardness is equivalent to a legendary equipment. In this state, ordinary physical and magical attacks are nearly immune to Keller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that eyewitnesses said that when Richard took Keller into the earth, it was such a blow from beginning to end. Can see Keller's injury, it seems that the lord of the Abyss and the Dragon to shoot a paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis raised his head and glanced at the four guards, his look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the expedition, Keller brought the army of 70,000, and now, in addition to himself, the only one of the four guards. It is obvious that Richard intends to let them return to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 70,000-strong army was wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much have we died in battle?" The Marquis voice was very hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About five thousand, the rest have surrendered." A guard who sent Keller returned whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the casualty of Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About...one or two Thousands..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five thousand...." The Marquis suddenly flew up and kicked the guard. Flying more than ten meters, blasted through the two walls, only fell to the ground, seeing is not alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis was just like a returning man, snarling hysterically: "Five thousand! There are only five thousand in the war! I am in the army of Brahms." It turns out that this is a group of wastes that are greedy and fearful of death! What is the use of these people to raise you!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals bowed down, and even the atmosphere did not dare to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the generals know that there are 5,000 deaths and there may be 20,000 injuries. An army casualty has reached this level, and surrender is not ashamed. What's more, at the beginning of the war, Keller was crushed by Richard. This army can support this level. In fact, it can already be called the Yong Yong Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to blame, you can only blame Keller for this idiot that is not self-sufficient and loses so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis gasps like a wild animal and whispers: "You said, what should I do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What should I do? The generals looked at each other and no one made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they have an answer in mind, one is to wait, see what Richard wants to do, and then resign. The other is to return the gods Mujin to Richard. But no one is stupid enough to say the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not want to wait for the answer, waved the generals out, leaving only a few large priests in the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When will that person arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great priest said: "Three "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days?! Three days, enough for Richard to turn over my territory!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great priest is calm as usual, not arrogant: "This incident happened too suddenly, and His Highness is carrying out a key battle in the plane. Three days is already the fastest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms is gloomy and said: "Do you blame me for making my own claim?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare." The great priest bowed slightly and said that he would give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brahs glared at him, but knew that he couldn’t really do anything to the great priest, even if he was the scepter of the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move of Richard made people somewhat incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the victory of the victory, Li Chabing in the next day, the city, and even the night of the fierce battle, to midnight, the city of 40,000 city defense army casualties over 10,000, surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still reasonable, but then Richard will divide the army into five teams, respectively, to the five important towns within the Marquis territory, while Dozens of squadrons and patrolling the Marquis led the whole territory. Actually, I am really looking for the whereabouts of the feather of the red eagle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five units that Licha had divided were five or six thousand people, and they attacked the five major towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brahs has claimed to have 200,000 private troops, but the most elite troops have been annihilated in Kyle and Nikko City during the first battle, now Only the 10,000 defenders of the Dragon Wing Castle are still elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the defenders in other places, the combat power is almost heaven and earth compared with the Archimonde army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the attack on the town, Richard did not search for property, nor did he change the bureaucracy. It is simply occupying, maintaining the right of passage of his own army, and then searching for the whereabouts of the feather of the Red Eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, many people can't figure out the purpose of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the look of Richard, it seems that he is really searching for the feather of the Red Eagle, rather than trying to occupy the territory of Brahms. In fact, on the first day, the private army of the Marquis of Brahms was disfigured by Richard. It would not be too difficult for Richard to attack the Dragon Wing Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupation is not a problem, the problem is only how to hold this territory after the occupation. In fact, several aristocrats and dynasty aristocracy bureaus around the sacred dynasty have been waiting to see the next step of Richard's decision to decide when to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Richard did, he seemed to have no interest in Brahms’s territory, but just wanted to ‘investigate’ the Red Eagle’s feather. Although this kind of investigation is quite humiliating for a long-established aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ‘investigation’ process, most places wisely chose to cooperate as much as possible, and a small number of people rebelled. For the rebel, Richard is unceremonious and is all killed on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few times, those who thought that Richard didn’t dare to do anything were not dead, they were arrested, and no one dared to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two days, the Marquis of Brahms spent the torment. Every action of Richard was like a slap on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Richard is meticulous in his work, he strictly follows the method of screening for bandits, and has set up checkpoints in the traffic destinations of the entire territory of the Marquis to check the passing and passing. As a result, the news inside the Marquis was like a wing, and it spread throughout the entire upper class of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of reluctance, the Marquis of Brahms has become the center of the issue. And the fact that the gods Mujin was hijacked was quickly known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are not fools, and immediately understand that for no reason, the Marquis of Brahms provoked Richard, and as a result, Richard immediately resounded. The slap in the face pulled back and made him faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now everyone is waiting to see what kind of counterattack the next Marquis will have. If the counterattack is not sharp enough, then Brahms will become a laughing stock, and may be laughed at for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restlessness made the Marquis have no appetite. He suddenly wanted to eat some fresh game, so he sent a small team to guard the castle to hunt. As a result, the team’s guards just went out and returned to the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! Richard actually set the level to the door of our castle?" The long-lost scream of the Marquis rang again in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on a scarlet cloak, and without saying anything, strode to the main entrance of the castle. There are more than 10,000 defenders in the Dragon Wing Castle. These are the most elite warriors in the territory. Even if Richard immediately attacks the army, the Marquis is confident that these people will hold the castle until the dynasty reinforcements arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After boarding the castle wall, the Marquis was almost stunned. The so-called checkpoint is the most rudimentary anti-cavalry fortifications that have been sharpened with sharpened wood. That's it. The key is that the units that Archimonde sent to guard the customs, there are only a dozen people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people, even if they are all the most elite knights, the defenders in the castle will be able to cut them all. More than a dozen Archimonde fighters are the most common soldiers, including only one officer, and the lowest level of non-commissioned officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not say a word, flew down the city, and immediately ordered to open the castle gate, riding out, and rushed to the Akmen who still set up the level Before the German soldiers, they screamed: "What do you want to do? Don't you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
