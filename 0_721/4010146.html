She has already seen that Richard is determined to do something, but he is worried about the safety of Richard. After all, now Archimonde is not like Mensa, and there is not even a sanctuary on the entire floating island except for Faschi. The Mensa family has at least one of the top 20 powerhouses on the floating island. But somehow, the original character of Vinica is now very afraid of Richard, this is a feeling of unclear, she is also very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not get angry, nor would he bark. Until now, he seems very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting, Richard said to Venica: "The next time this kind of thing happens, don't be alone, remember to tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica bit his lip and hesitated: "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said "I know that every Archimonde has a tendency to go it alone. It doesn't matter, but it will wait until you really grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde and Richard had a tacit understanding. When he appeared, he still carried a enchanted box behind him. He didn't know what was inside. Faschi seems to be confused and does not understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the transmission array, he remembered one thing and asked Vinika: "Yes, what is the small door, Sado? Strength?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinika thought for a moment and said, “He should be 21 years old this year, a 14th-level magician.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "The strength is still right, it has something to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard appeared on the top floor of the hotel on the side of the duel. Xiaomensa has already wrapped this layer. The young people present are not only the Mensa family. From dozens of young people, Richard also recognizes Lunault’s student Fengster. And the younger generation of McCain in the Bear Peter family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and touched his short lip on his upper lip and smiled: "The person who comes is really good, it seems that I have a hatred." The guys are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others didn't pay attention, but the light in the eyes of Gangde flashed. He followed Richard for a long time and knew the meaning of some subconscious little actions. When Richard first touched the short hair of the lips, it was to kill the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard’s gaze fell on Winnington. This boy is covered in blood and falls to the ground. There is also a young man with a cold face who is stepping on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t need to have reconnaissance, just look at the new wound on the young nose, and I know that he must be the youngest son of the Duke of Mensa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked to the front of Xiaomensa less than five meters before standing, arms around, said faintly: "Okay, I have come." You can take your feet back. There are already a lot of people here, and everyone in the family has arrived. No one is a fool, and then step on it, you are stepping on the face of the old man. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaomensa's face immediately became iron blue, and Richard's reaction was completely different from his expectations, which made him feel overwhelmed. In the end, he took back his foot and sneered and said: "I didn't expect your mouth to be more powerful than the structure. If you want to end up better, you should learn to take control of your mouth."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I kill the most, I will let you try!" Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small door Sa’s eyes immediately overflowed with murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hotel also has many other family members, just as Richard said, almost all the giants on the floating island are present. It seems that this time Mensa is the iron heart ready to make things bigger. However, it is not all people who are watching the lively, but also many people standing on the side of Richard, such as Nyris and Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nyris’s face looked ugly, staring at a young man opposite, suddenly said: “Three of you, why are you here?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary young man is the brother of Nyris, the third son of Philip. He smiled coldly at Neris and said, "You can come, why can't I come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at the scene, his face Unsightly, said: "Is this all you are instructing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three emperors shrugged and said: "Don't say so, I can afford not It’s such a heavy responsibility. This is a contradiction between the small Men’s and the Archimonde’s little guy. I’m just passing by, and by the way, look at it. You see, the second Highness is not here?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris's pupils shrank, looking in the direction of the fingers of the three emperors, and surely saw a plain white fat man in the corner. This young fat man seems completely harmless, and I don’t know where to move a chair to sit and pose a lively look. Seeing Neris's gaze sweeping, the fat man opened his mouth and revealed a bright smile. The fat man has no sense of existence at all, and almost everyone will subconsciously ignore him. Until the three emperors pointed out that he came, Nyris noticed that there was such a fat man sitting in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing this white fat man, Agamemnon also looked dignified. Because he knows that this fat man named Nero is the second prince of Philip, and the current score is far ahead of the second place. The second emperor is the most like of all the emperors, and he looks like Philip, not only the appearance, but also the temperament. In other words, if someone thinks he is bullied, it is not far from death. In the obese body, there is hidden power that Agamemnon is also afraid of. In the past year, no one has ever seen Nero and people do it, but a year ago, there was a strong person close to the sanctuary who did not know Nero’s identity. In the pub, there was a conflict with the woman for him. The result was severely wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who knows this thing has come to the conclusion that the strength of being close to the sanctuary simply does not test the strength of Nero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero and the Three Emperors were present, things became more complicated. With the presence of quicksand, Nolan and Greek, the two forces representing the royal family and the eternal dragon temple have all arrived. So at least on the surface, everything must follow the rules of fait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa embraced his arms and kicked Winnington to Richard’s side. He said, “This guy can give it to you first. Kemond can give a good deal to the aftermath, but this guy insults me, then I have to accept my duel request. I am not going to cancel this duel. You will be ready to collect the corpse for you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the eyes of Xiaomen Sa, suddenly smiled and said: "Why must you make such trouble? You are not coming to me, if so, then simply Point, let me fight with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small door of Sa’s eyes is cold, and the light is tender, and it is pressed down again, saying: "This is you. Said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall young man behind Xiaomen Sa sneered and said: "Even if you have a duel, you should wait until the game is finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looks at the idiot’s expression Young people, and unscrupulously put a reconnaissance on him. This was a very rude move, so the tall young man was furious and pointed to what Richard had just wanted to say, but was interrupted by Richard: "It turned out to be a 12-level magician. Well, you and the door. What is the relationship between Sa Laotou, if the relationship is close enough, I can consider a duel with you, first warm up with you. If it doesn't matter, then how far do you fuck to me? How far is it? The part! What are you talking about, what is a dog screaming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that later, it was already very strong, and the young man could not help but retreat. Half a step, then wake up, his face suddenly burst into purple! However, in the presence of a large number of nobles, he still had to maintain a minimum demeanor, but the voice could not help but tremble: "I am the grandson of the Duke of Mensa, my son, the son of Hongsong, I am now honorary jazz, this identity is enough "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately nodded: "Yes! The identity of the old man's blood is on the line! We will fight for a while."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stunned, he didn’t really want to fight with Richard. Both sides are 12th-level magicians, and it is hard to say who wins or loses. Archimonde and Mensa had bloody enmity, but that was between the direct Duke of Mensa and the Gotton family. The other Mensa and Ellie and Soren had not yet reached the point of launching the war. So then, he didn't want to die for Mensa. After all, he still has a great future, and the future big magician is beckoning to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hesitation of the young people was seen in the eyes of Li, and immediately laughed and said: "The original honor and courage of Mensa is just dare. Fighting with people who are lower than their own level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of a younger generation of the Mensa family immediately became extremely ugly, and the small door is even more like Squirting fire. Richard's words are no different than a loud slap in the face. If they don't respond, then even the Duke of Mensa can hardly raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small door Sa Li: "Foodo, promise him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name The young man named Feodo is equally ugly. He wanted to show his strength and fight for the upper position. Who knows it was dragged down easily by Richard. He also has a lot of ideas, knowing that most of Richard wants to take him to take the opportunity to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s gaze finally fell on Xiaomensa, smiling and said: “The next thing is between us. If you want to fight with me, It’s not enough to put only Winnington.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small door Sashen was cold and said: “What conditions do you want?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has found that the conflict of tongues has no effect on Richard, and he directly reveals the fangs. And Xiaomensa also feels that Fodoro is not the opponent of Richard, but at least can play the role of seeing the strength of Richard, and can consume some of the magic of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s gaze crossed the small door, and fell on a very beautiful girl in the crowd. Her temperament is lavish in pride, but it is as cold as ice, even in the presence of beautiful women, it is particularly eye-catching. If you look at the figure, it is even slightly stronger than the sand. It’s just that the sand temperament is unique, but it’s not that she can match it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ivory skin of a girl and the look of a sculpture are very famous throughout the world, and Richard has heard it. So Richard gave the girl a slight sigh and smiled and asked, "Is this beautiful Miss Qi Qi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
