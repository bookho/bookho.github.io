In fact, the barbarian girl did not deliberately comprehend anything. She didn't think about anything, just sitting there in a daze, and then naturally Understand the fifty rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comprehending the rules of the Greenson plane, the sacred officer obviously has more advantages, and the dark gods Axiris have learned more than one hundred and seventy. Nolan is comprehending some exaggerated two hundred and thirty. Two big Druids from the Yongye tribe are not too small. They will soon be promoted from the 17th to the 18th, thus getting a strong. Natural ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris does not feel that it is a shame to lose to Nolan. Instead, he is proud of the small gap between Nolan and the Dragon Palace. The great priests were originally geniuses in genius, and because of the eternal and timeless dragons, they have an advantage in comprehending the plane rules. It is only a little bit different, which is enough to show that Nireus’s talents are so full, and the four emperors are so big. It was proud, smiling warmly, and found Richard. He remembered that the life tree was lost to Richard when he first learned the rules. In a sense, the four emperors avenged Kung Fu and the famous Su Hailun have a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nyris asked, the eyes of a group of powerful people gathered on Richard, and the breath of Richard’s breath changed significantly, apparently this time. The tree of life was very rewarding when it was promoted, but they could not see the truth of Richard. Now the strength of Richard has become blurred, which makes the powerful powerful people very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this question, Li laughed and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people and his relationship are different. Some things can be said, but they are not easy to lie, but this question is actually not very good to say, is it Li? Can tell Nyris that he has only learned a thousand rules and crossed the key point of 2048. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha laughs here, Nyris begins to grind his teeth, and he has already guessed some of the answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy, will not just comprehend the 210 rules, damn it." Nyris himself has learned two hundred and nine rules. If you lose because of one difference, it is really a serious blow. It’s hard to lose a dozen or so. Nyris doesn’t think Richard can surpass Nolan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little competition ended in Richard’s laugh and Neris’s grind, and whether it’s better than comprehending how many rules It is more important, which means that there is no chance to promote the legend in the future. Although Greenson’s rules of the plane are simple and the applicability is not very strong, even if it is only a comprehension, it is very helpful, even if the power cannot Therefore, it will grow, but the control of power will also be enhanced. This is the real combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life is completed, and all the strong people are looking for a tree house to rest in the tree. In the next few days, they need to comprehend The rules are analyzed one by one, and they are integrated into their own skills and strengths. This is the real rule of the law. This process is very long, but the sooner you start, the more you benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the strong, many of the knights have also gained, the knights are originally talented, able to cultivate to thirteen or four Warriors, but their talents are not good enough, and it is difficult to break through the sanctuary in their lifetime. This will choose to become a knight. Once they break through the sanctuary, such as Raya, they will be qualified to become followers of the big family. With a certain degree of autonomy, the power of the powerful planes gathered in the life tree can improve the physique of the knights, making their corresponding level caps loose, with a small probability, the presence of the installation. There may be one or two more people in the Cavaliers who break through the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of the elves are also obvious. Many low-level elves even raise the level directly. The power of the tree of life is very suitable for the elf to capture, so the elf strength of the battle or More or less increased. In general, the more powerful the elves benefit, the more the sacred area above, the breath of the tree of life does not increase the physical effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest gain of Richard is still in comprehending the rules. The first key point of the Green Forest rule is 1024, which allows Richard to take life. Incorporating with natural forces in its own magic and attack, the second key point breakthrough enables Richard to mobilize the surrounding nature and life forces in a limited way, thus greatly improving the corresponding effects of magic and attack. The effect of the legendary mage, but Richard's current magic is still around the 19th level, temporarily unable to improve quickly, after crossing the threshold of the sanctuary, the tree of life can not help Richard to enhance the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hen's nest has begun to swallow the body of the natural enemy of the tree of life. The analysis progress of the crow is directly inherited from the nest body. Now there are a large number of corpses, the resolution has exceeded 400%, and the wood ants have also broken through the 200% mark. The progress immediately slowed down, and the crypt spider analysis exceeded 100%, which means that Richard has a strong underground unit in his future choices, but the power of the crypt spider reaches 16th level, not to mention the avatar. The nest body can't be produced now. In the end, it is the reincarnation tribe. Just two people make the resolution reach 50%. It is surprising. It seems that this is a powerful, but rare, ethnic group. The analysis makes the hens master the structure of their limbs. This is a limb structure that can travel quickly under complex terrain. It can be directly applied to bird-eaters, worker bees and other units, and can even be used to transform the magical ride. Create a new ride with limited load but extremely fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has been transferred to the preliminary design. The lower body is similar to the structure of ants. It has six long legs and has a full terrain. The ability is twice as fast as the magic ride. In the complex mountains and forests, the speed of movement is even at an astonishing speed of 80 kilometers per hour. It can be used as a mount, and the upper body of other combat units can be attached to it, thus becoming similar. A half-human battle unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and took a look at the analysis of the other races of the mother's nest. Finally, he chose the guardian elf as an additional blueprint, and the new seat as a sports chassis. The scheme created a kind of upper body that was an elf. The lower part of the body was a hexapod-like fighting unit. When I saw the new unit designed, Richard could not help but think of some legends of the dark elves, so I took this new The combat unit is named a spider wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of the spider can be upgraded from eight to fifteen. The eight-level spider can only use light weapons such as bows and swords. A light armor, from the tenth level, you can have a new resurrection of the spider elves, you can use the natural spells of the spider priests and other new changes, when the mother nest will evolve to the tenth level in the future, have their own real name, and After starting to resolve the plane rules, the spider spirit will be further strengthened. Individual elite units can even have the ability to resemble the son of the forest, and can be recognized and protected by the will of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard is quite satisfied with the spider spirit. It can be said that they are more suitable for the Greenson battle environment than the guardian spirit, when the number of spiders After reaching a certain scale and the combination of the units is reasonable, only by them, Richard can cross the forest, and most importantly, the spider spirit is not affected by the forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly understood that this is the real scary thing of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which plane grows in the plane, it will adjust itself according to the environment of the plane, so that the created combat unit can adapt to the environment of the plane. It is an incomparable evolutionary ability. In some special planes, the environment is the real enemy. For example, Green Sen, in fact, the guardian elves are not powerful and the number is small. The real headache is the forest will, more extreme. The examples are the abyss and hell. In that place, ordinary humans can't live for a long time, and the power of legendary powers will be weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the harvest from the tree of life itself, the biggest harvest is naturally the fruit of life, after the golden stage, the tree of life can condense a life every six years. Fruit, but the price is that the growth rate of the tree itself has slowed down a lot. Now it has been several years since the last harvest of the fruit of life. When the order is large, the strength of the plane that was not taken in time can also be used to condense the fruit of life, so life The tree can now grow two fruits of life, but Richard weighs it, only let the tree of life produce a fruit of life that can last for fifteen years, and then save the remaining essence of life for later growth. In less than ten years, this tree of life can be promoted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of youth can receive nearly a hundred pieces. These emerald leaves are things that can make the aristocratic ladies and ladies crazy, and they attract men. The force is also huge. No one does not want to look young and handsome. The more the upper-level characters, the more they value the leaves of youth. As for the twigs of the tree of life, Richard will forget that excessive harvesting will affect the growth of the tree of life, and he Now there is no shortage of this. Richard has plundered the entire three guardian elves, plus the inventory of the Eternal Elf. Now there are nearly 30 natural staff in the warehouse, and there are more than 70 branches of life tree. Waiting for processing, Richard now has so many big Druids in his hand, and all Druids are not more than one hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the twig of life tree can not only be used as a natural staff, it is widely used, it is a very rare equipment material, and the price in Noland is still natural. Above the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, it is a big tank of life tree springs, which can be used to make superior magic and life potions, worth a lot, only this tank tree spring You can sell hundreds of thousands of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking out the harvest, so that Richard, who is used to the big money, is also very satisfied. Sure enough, the tree of life is the source of wealth. For the now heavily indebted Richard, This harvest was very timely, so I was more satisfied with the tree of life, so I took a picture of the trunk and encouraged: "Hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
