			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the letter to the suspected Dragon Master, Richard called the old butler, flying fast I have prepared a list for him to purchase as soon as possible. Then call a team of guards, move the ancient beast bones out to the eternal dragon temple. He still owes a sacrifice to a low-level sacrifice. It is not a good idea to owe the account of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet and quiet room in the apse of the Eternal Dragon Hall, the Vatican is sitting opposite the flowing sand. At this time, in the eyes of Vatican, the ability to name the sand has been greatly enhanced, and the power of the rich time hovered around her eyebrows. There will be one or two points of star sand leaking from time to time. The book of Time at the sand hand is also emitting a distant atmosphere. Obviously, the power has also been greatly strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Vatican sighed and said, "Are you already decided?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes. Without me, everything he had in the Faro plane would collapse quickly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you should understand that the closer you are to him, the less likely you are to get rid of the bondage in the future. The magic of the gods is equivalent to entangled a shackle on himself." Vatican said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "We are the eternal and the dragon of time. The oracle, while gaining tremendous power, has to pay more. I need to remind you that the account of the dragon and the dragon of time will definitely find that it is the worst decision. You will soon I found that my debts are getting more and more, and I am ultimately unable to repay. If you want to get out now, with my help, there is still a possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sand drifted again and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin has no choice but to sigh and say, "Let him know your decision!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; 流沙笑笑, said: "No, he is very smart, will see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin looked at the sand, but shook his head and said: "He is still too young, he will only rush to the front and will not know how to cherish the people and things around him. You just say that I want to give me peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is nothing wrong with my choice. Isn't that the replacement of your position?" Liu Sha said in an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a light curtain lit up in the quiet room, revealing the figure of hope. She said: "Two of His Royal Highness, Richard came, and he brought a sacrifice, hoping to repay the debt owed to the Dragon Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know. Flowing sand, let's go see it." Van Gogh said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flowing sand left the quiet room, the sigh of Vatican came out in the dark and far-reaching hall. A few decades ago, Vatican had the same idea as the quicksand, so he stood in the position of the great priest today. The Eternal Dragon Hall is her ultimate destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the partial hall of the Eternal Dragon Hall, four priests are surrounding the ancient animal bones to test its value. These experienced priests undoubtedly have considerable authority in judging the value of sacrifices. Richard took the time to get busy around the portal leading to the Faro plane, complementing and perfecting the transfer magic array to enhance the plane channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, how do you always have so many sacrifices in your hand?" The familiar voice of Liusha came from behind and let Richard stand up with some surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will always be a way to sacrifice! How to be my exclusive priest in the future!" Richard said half-jokingly. However, when he said this, he made the busy priests in the temple look at the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who is the eternal and timeless dragon does not need to be so religious, as long as he presides enough sacrifices, the natural power will rise. Each time a sacrifice is made, the clerics involved will receive different graces depending on their role. The benefits of following Richard are also obvious. In the Norland time, the sands only stayed in the ectopic plane for less than a month, and the magical skills rose to a full two levels. The book of artifact time was also greatly strengthened. How much grace does this have to be? Now that Richard has just returned from the ecstasy, not only released two sets of suits that shocked the whole of Faustian, but also got the title of the royal constructor. In the twinkling of an eye, they took out such a good sacrifice as the ancient animal bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four priests quickly set the value of the ancient animal bones, and after reimbursing a low-level sacrifice owed by Richard, there is still a lot of surplus. The quicksand glanced at the measured data and let Richard wait here and ran into the backyard warehouse. After a while, she walked out with two staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is two dark gold staff, about one meter long, more like a scepter in shape. The top of the scepter is engraved with the legendary angel from heaven, but the two angels have only one side of the wings behind them. The angel on the left is a white wing, and the one on the right is a dark black flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand put two sticks in the hands of Richard and said: "There is a lot of gods and bones of the ancient beast, so it is better to take it to the temple." Change something. These two staffs are very good, just change them, just take one, I take one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, good! The tone of the sand flowing is not like consultation, but a notice. When Richard took over the staff, he had to agree. However, he saw the faces of the priests around him a little weird, so he carefully looked at the two staffs in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time of Deep Blue, Richard is already a qualified appraisal master. Each of these two wands has six enchantments, fully reaching the level of legendary items. However, they each have their own emphasis. The winged angels add more and more to the magic, and the fallen angels greatly enhance the effects of various attacks and negative state magic, and also improve the magic damage. Holding this staff is equivalent to adding a magical effect at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good things!" Richard praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamer snorted and grabbed the winged angel before saying, "Of course! Will the things I pick will be worse?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests look at each other and their expressions are very strange. Comparing the artifacts of the ‘destiny twins’, can a good thing be summed up? However, since the sand can be taken out of the storeroom, it is the signature of the Vatican's great priests, and they naturally won't talk too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the day after tomorrow I will go to the family's Greenson plane to settle the rebellion there. Let's go together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha said: "I still want to go to the rebellion? Time is up, don't forget that we are here for a day, and Faro is there for ten days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Our strength is still dominant in the Greenson plane, so it won't take much time, up to three or five days to resolve those rebels," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
