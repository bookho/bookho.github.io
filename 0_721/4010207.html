But before Richard went to the elders, the tree of life suddenly said: "Please wait, you bring a wonderful weapon, it makes me feel very familiar. But its power is so severely damaged that it is at the deepest Sleep state. I can infuse it with some energy, if you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wonderful weapon?" Richard glimpsed, then remembered something, Turned to look at the long-named elf knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife was given to him by Gordon, but even Gotton couldn’t tell the source, and it hasn’t shown any special place all along. . It's just that the material is good, no matter what happens, it won't be damaged. Richard has always been carrying it. In fact, this knife is a bit too long. Richard is not very easy to use. He has always been with him. In fact, it is mainly because this is the only gift that Gordon gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard himself would not admit this at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the elf knife, and then a branch of the tree of life rolled up a long knife and put it into the trunk. After the green light flashed lightly, the nameless knife has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes a day to replenish energy for it." Life Tree said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hurry, I just need to deal with something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, In a tree house on the tree of life, Richard saw the elder elder. The old elder is still languid, and he has suffered a lot of injuries and has not recovered. But even if he was in a state of fullness, surrounded by Richard, Nyris and Agamemnon, there was no room for rebellion and struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have seen the decision of the tree of life, do you still need to hesitate?" Richard opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders seem to be struggling repeatedly, and Nyris again persuaded and guaranteed the safety of the rest of the elves, and promised that the elves who fled would return I have never been jealous. In this persuasion process, Nyris finally revealed a little prince's traits, the language is warm but firm, very persuasive and inflammatory, and people can't help but follow his ideas. The elf elders finally agreed to surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, under the tree of life, hundreds of elves who have spent the rest of their lives are clustering together, apparently helpless. The biggest blow is from the tree of life on which they depend. The process of compromising the tree of life and Richard is in the eyes, and the two sides finally reach an end to the agreement, let the elves find that what they have sweared to have lost their meaning. Maybe the past is meaningful, but now and in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it necessary to fight the invaders, and to avenge the dead people? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tree of life has reached the same level as the invaders, attacking the invaders, will it be necessary to attack the spiritual pillars of their lives at the same time? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elder elders came out of the tree house with exhaustion and walked to the tribe and announced the decision to surrender to the invaders, the response was not anger And the hustle and bustle, but the eyes of the tribes are confused and helpless. Even the elder Druid, who was originally a radical, was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp scream in the elf cage below the tree of life, which was the scream of the vampire. Richard and Dragon Master Lina constantly burned vampires with flames. In particular, Lina's flame has the characteristics of Longyan, thick and thick, and the power is not affected by the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire vines in the cage were quickly burned and the captives were burned. Richard and the soldiers worked together to pick up all the bones that had not been completely burned from the ashes, dug a pit in the open space beside the tree of life, and buried them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder looked at the busy Richard, faintly thinking that perhaps the future fate will not be too tragic. From the moment they decide to surrender, their fate depends on Richard’s character and mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard first returned to the city, and let the unicorn escort a group of soldiers through the dangerous area of ​​30 kilometers. Stationed to the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no fighting spirits that are allowed to stay in the tree of life, while the combative elf warriors are divided into two, half followed by the elf elders guard The tree of life, the other half was brought back by Richard. If it weren't for the growth of the young elves that required the breath of the tree of life, Richard would bring them back to the city. These are the most effective means of keeping the Green Elf and reminding them to follow the oath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Sensing Elf is also called the Elves, but it is quite different from the Norland elves. They are not as refined and artistic as Norland elves, and they have a highly brilliant civilization that is not inferior to humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Sens are still in a relatively primitive phase, they are more belligerent, and they are quite brutal and bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard does not trust the Greenwood Elf. If there is no mandatory constraint, who knows when these guys will betray. The tree of life can't believe in it, so the sands make the tree of life swear to the book of time. Once the magic vows are broken, the tree of life will be punished accordingly, but with its huge body, grand will, and environmental advantages of Green Forest, even the sands themselves will not assert that the magic vows must have absolute constraints. force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is still subject to sporadic attacks from the other two elves. There are two life trees, and there must be two elves. I just don't know that the two tree of life are far and near, but they are definitely far beyond the influence of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops stationed in the Tree of Life were led by elite humanoid knights, and a total of 100 soldiers were sent. The main responsibility of these fighters is to monitor the elves instead of fighting other enemies. After a few days, when Nyris returned to the city with the latest spring of cohesion, the situation in this direction was generally stable. Richard sent several logging teams, took turns, and went all the way to the path of the tree of life. In this direction, there is no forest to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other two tribes of Druids will still drive away the forest to harass, but Richard has enough experience to deal with them. After Richard set up two ambushes in succession and successfully killed three Druids, the two elves did not dare to arbitrarily send Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the twinkling of an eye, the Greenson plane has been two months away. Richard stabilized the situation here and redrawn a set of secret guides and a set of wild strikes in a month. Later, Richard and Niris and Agamemnon discussed and decided to return to Noland in order to fulfill the staged benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This return, but also shipped back a lot of supplies, mainly all kinds of rare trees. Among them, the torso of the old war tree Urano is the most precious. Although Agamemnon was forced to ruin its tree, but the core part of the remnant is still a strong life energy, worth a lot, this piece is worth 300,000. A total of about 300,000 other types of wood and tree trunks can be sold together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
