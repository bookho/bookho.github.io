Then the exclamation and screams continued to ring and soon became a piece. The thick blood began to permeate with the night wind. Soon, the killing and screams gradually became sparse. Thousands of knights escaped from the other side of the woods. They tried their best to push the horse and disappeared into the depths of the night before turning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard stood in the woods and scanned the battlefield. A personal warrior is cleaning up the battlefield, carrying out the wounded warrior and adding a knife to the undead enemy. This is an almost one-sided slaughter. With the help of powerful magic and magical powers, there are only a dozen humanoid warriors who died in battle. The Imperial Cavalry is almost completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A victory, but Li’s face does not see the color of happiness, on the contrary, it is getting more and more gloomy. Whether it was tenacity in the war or the fighting power that broke out in desperation, the Imperial Cavalry left a deep impression on Richard. It seems that this time, Allenville brought all the elite troops. As a result, tomorrow's battle is not optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly pulled over Gangde and whispered a few words, so Gangde greeted all followers, and Xiyou and others were not affiliated with Richard. The warriors took them out of the woods. Until they left, Richard made an order, so the humanoid warriors and the throwing soldiers suddenly put down their work, but they rushed to the dead horse corpse and silently divide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the woods, only the chewing sound of rustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the breath of a personal warrior has once again become stronger. As long as there is enough flesh and blood and food, the combat unit recovers as fast as the treatment is released. This scene naturally cannot be seen by outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Oasis, he had passed the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in the entire city has been extinguished, and the soldiers who fought for a day have fallen asleep, and there are more fierce battles waiting for them tomorrow. The residents and slaves in the city are busy repairing the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the city, Richard first gathered all the followers, the nobility generals, and the three goddess gods and other important figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone arrived, Richard Shen said: "You! Although we repelled the attack of the Iron Triangle Emperor today, if you don't do it If you change, tomorrow's battle, we will lose no doubt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li said this, all the noble generals looked at each other and everyone was pale. They are all people who have participated in the first half of the war. At this moment, they have almost blind confidence in Richard. Richard said that he must lose, that is, he will definitely lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't we run away?" a general hesitated. There are still a large number of troops in the city, and there is resistance. More importantly, there are massive cavalry under Jarenville. If you abandon the city and flee, it must be a tragedy. In the end, it is likely that only a few people will be able to escape to the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of martial arts, between life and dignity, many nobles will choose dignity. They would rather die on the battlefield than to let the soldiers escape without fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving everyone’s reactions, Richard said: “In fact, we have a way to reverse the disadvantages of quantitative comparison.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Impossible!” an aristocrat yelled. “Sirrenville brought 30,000 people, but all the people in the blue water oasis city are together, less than 30,000 people!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and said with a deep meaning: "No, there are a total of 60,000 people here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nobleman widened his eyes and lost his voice: "You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Armed slaves!" Richard said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles looked at each other and they were really hesitant. Armed slaves are things they can't even think about. How to prevent slave riots, each lord will be regarded as a top priority. Now, do you have to take the initiative to send slave weapons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a nobleman smiled and persuaded: "Mr. Richard, those slaves who get weapons, I am afraid they will point to us first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our last resort." Richard said, "And I still have some certainty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a deep worry between an elderly aristocrat, and he said, "If you do this, you will have a very dangerous precedent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows are tight, but the look is very firm: "Just decide it! Oral!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf poet is out . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to gather my sand cavalry and barbarian warriors. In addition, collect all the slaves of the city and bring them to the central square. Go up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral led the way and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also called Clark and Gangde to prepare weapons and food separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, more than 20,000 slaves were taken to the square in the city, and their faces looked awkward and did not understand what was going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are slave races, but at most the indigenous people, the sand people. The Shamin cavalry belonging to Richard has only a thousand years left after today’s war. They lined up neatly in formation and stood in front of Richard. After Licha’s squatting for a long time, even the most frivolous sand people gradually became elite warriors with strict discipline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in front of his own Shamin and Barbarian warriors and suddenly asked: "It was originally a slave, raise your hand!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are very confused, but obeying the order has cost, so they raised their arms in a tight manner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were amazement among the nobles behind Li, who did not expect that Richard’s fearful warriors were almost all slaves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very satisfied with the nod, and then snorted: "Now that you have obtained the status of a warrior, raise your hand!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another dense arm lifted, except for a few of the latest additions to Richard, and the soldiers who have been with Richard for a little longer have accumulated enough military power to gain freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard pointed to the corner of the square and was full of swords in the direction of his fingers. "Here, it is the most basic tool for becoming a warrior, weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the slaves in the square and said, "There is, and The original people of your identity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shamen cavalry and barbarian warriors look at the weapons, then look at the compatriots who are still slaves, and begin to understand What, the face began to show excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard raised his voice and said loudly: "Now, pick up the weapon and give it to your companions to tell them how to become a warrior." As long as they can do what you have already done, you can become my warrior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a calm in the square...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly! A barbarian warrior strode out of the queue, picked up a dozen or so heavy tomahawks, and then went to the barbarian slaves in the slave, stuffed a tomahawk in each person's hand, and then in their ears. When I said something, I finally took a note on their chest and went to the next barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a group of sandmen’s cavalry also ran out of the queue, picked up bundles of weapons, rushed to the slaves and smashed the sword They are in their hands, and they continue to scream in the language of their own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gradual confusion in the square, and as the number of slaves with weapons increased, the faces of the nobles began to be filled with uneasiness. Only Richard looked calm and quietly watched the development of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, almost all slaves got weapons. The atmosphere is beginning to become subtle and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next age-old barbarian of Richard’s rushed out and yelled at the barbarians in the slave ranks. The barbarians hesitated and finally walked to the other side of the square. More and more barbarians followed them to the side of the square. Soon, all the barbarians gathered and stood up to represent the place where they were willing to fight for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riots in the slaves of the sand people gradually expanded, and some people began to walk towards the side of the square. Soon, almost all the slaves who took up the weapon stood on the right side from the left side of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard finally smiled and turned back to the nobles: "It seems that tomorrow we can give a great surprise to Allen. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility nodded and finally breathed a sigh of relief. When the hung hearts finally fell, they found themselves in a cold sweat. But what they don't know is that Richard is also sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day when the sun rises, the reunion of the military camp’s emperor’s regiment appears again outside the blue water oasis, and it takes no extra effort to attack. Enter the city. There is nothing to burn in Oasis City, but it is still shining, it is the flame of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville stood in the command car, staring at a team of Imperial soldiers into the Oasis City. But this messy city is like a bottomless mud, no matter the soldiers, it will fall into it. The killing sounds from morning to noon. As time went on, more and more injured imperial warriors were lifted out of the city, but the blue water oasis city showed no signs of falling, and the defenders did not even mean to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue water oasis city, the Imperial Warriors have been everywhere, and the ubiquitous enemies are killing. In such a messy situation, Salenville has long been unable to command, and can only hope that the soldiers are well trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
