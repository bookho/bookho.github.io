			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this sentence is almost comical but no one laughs. When Jarenwell said that he might be able to win in three to one. Richard, but the other generals of the empire need at least five times more troops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor suddenly sighed heavily and said: "The Salenville has fallen to Richard. Even if I have assembled a 500,000-strong army to lead the troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal hesitated and tried to say: "His Majesty Li Shilongtu may be competent" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu used to be a name that could be tied with Sarenwell but his unwillingness to fight against Richard was a great loss of prestige<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor slowly nodded and said: "That's good to pass my order. Li Shilong's return is limited to three days. The mages who are responsible for the transmission array are ready to transmit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordering guards hurried to the emperor and thought about it again: "The empire is worthy of things." Recently, I heard that the territory is not Jing, so I am going to send a martial swordsman to the Norse Mountains to prevent bandits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers are all in the heart. Knowles Hill is Li Shilongtu The family and children of the family’s traditional territory, Li Shilongtu’s family and children, live there, and there is nothing to be found next to the emperor’s mountain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Iron Triangle Empire has Action Richard began to interpret this war according to his own rhythm. Nearly a thousand kinds of flying beasts of various types of reconnaissance have spread over dozens of brains over the Iron Triangle Empire, which constitute a solid node to support the entire information network. Any large-scale mobilization of more than a thousand people in the empire will now let Richard know within a few hours.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an imperial general who never imagined The war of the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has merged with the army of the Principality to start the mighty killing of the 80,000 army finally integrated into the Iron Triangle Empire plus various logistics and auxiliary More than 300,000 troops have gathered in the army. The elite 30,000 people crossed the entire army for dozens of kilometers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in a carriage in the army, Richard and Salenville are sitting opposite each other. In the middle is a not too big magic sandbox. Saranwell's face is staring at the magic sandbox, while Richard is constantly playing a crystal ball and occasionally reaching out on the magic sandbox. With every click of his magic. There will be some changes in the contents of the sandbox<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military arrangement of the Iron Triangle Empire can be said to be in the heart of Allenville. So the content changes on the sand table made him look shocked and saw the magic sandbox. Saranwell understood why the past lost in the hands of Richard. Miserable<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally raised his head and asked, "This makes me hard to believe...what did you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat incredible, but this is normal because this is the gap between the two planes." Richard said <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are ectopic faces The invaders said that when Saarwell was not surprised, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "But the gods of Faro are now There is not much punishment for my ability. The ultimate goal of this war is not the Iron Triangle Empire but your God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to go to Faro God challenge"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so much" Richard smiled and shook his head and turned the crystal ball in his hand and said, "I will only pick a god. In this case, I don't think that the gods of Faro will unite. On the contrary, as long as I release enough goodwill, there may be more gods standing on my side like the three goddesses."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell was silent for a long time before asking: "Three goddesses know that you are an alien invader?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...this is a betrayal of the entire plane"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But at that time, if you don't betray, you must be cleaned up by other gods in this plane." Richard said faintly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville sighed Looked up and looked at Richard and asked: "Why have you been staring at me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are a rare talent of Faro, if you are not bound by the plane itself The achievements will be much more than just people like you. I don't want to let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharonwell understands that Richard’s desire to let go has a double meaning Thinking about the film Revealing a bitter smile and asked: "Since you are my face from ectopic So what is the purpose conquer" <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Yes Conquest"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Plunder or destroy after conquest"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled Say: "Neither is a transaction"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell frowns and asks: "Why is it a transaction"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Because I get more than pure destruction and plunder"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the black warfare theory of the plane war. Jane has reached the point of ridiculousness, so the study of various economic behaviors has reached a profound realm. His profound wisdom has been brought to the forefront. In the eyes of the Grey Dwarf, an appropriate trading model can create ten times more than devastating plunder. Profits<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville is silent for a longer time. He is not a simple commander but prefers a king who governs the country, so he can understand Lee. The unfinished words of the inspection also know that the young Dagong will not give a second chance when he has to make a decision.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at Richard and asked: "How can I believe what you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a smile: "I don't have to follow You promise that you can only believe or you can try to influence my decision in your own way"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is full of tempting power but also cold Straightforwardly presupposes the master-slave relationship<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville caressed the delicate beard for a long time before he sighed heavily: "If I surrender, you can give me What kind of location?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Manage the Iron Triangle Empire for me first" Richard has obviously thought about it for a long time<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After destroying the country?" There is a bit of pain in the voice of Salenwell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not necessary to destroy the National Iron Triangle Empire. The blood of the royal family can also continue on the throne, but the person on the throne needs to change it. I think it is good to sit up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell said with a wry smile: "But it can't be exactly the same as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true that the Iron Triangle Empire will swear allegiance to me and formally become my vassal." The will and order to be executed in the most thorough manner throughout the country does not allow for any discounts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville immediately said with a smile: "This one I will become an eternal sinner of the empire, at least for decades, and I will be shackled for hundreds of years after I die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I smiled and didn't answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind outside the window of Sharon Vera blew in. The cold wind with strong moisture immediately made him chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a simple matter of death in the eyes of Salenwell. Being a royal member or a great magician, he has the secret to die immediately and don’t worry about his soul. When the battle at the border of the Devil's Hand came to an end, although the Undead Legion did not participate in the war, he clearly felt the mighty as a magician. The evil darkness is close at hand<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but death is the heaviest, and Saranwell doesn’t know if he’s dead here, if Richard still has patience from the empire Going to the second agent, the empire may never exist again, and the future and destiny of those familiar faces will no longer be able to do anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try Affecting his decision? Salenville had a moment to sneer at the young Dagong’s voice and still linger in the ear with the seduce of the young man’s sorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He has placed two choices in front of him but put a sweet bait on one of the toughest roads<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brigade outside the car window In the past ten years, these knights have left countless indelible dreams in the hearts of Allenville. No one wants to be strong and well equipped, with perfect cooperation and fearless death. Knight Fight<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the Knights and the Saron The difference between the coldest and the most sophisticated killing machines that have ever been seen is that the quality of their armor weapons has improved. This means that their combat power is once again improved<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
