Her psychological burden is actually much smaller than that of Stevenson, because she has long been abandoned by her father. Every gold coin squeezed out is an extra income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical ray of light suddenly flickers and devours the four letters. Stevenson also issued the highest level of magic signal, summoning all the people in the dark blue to his home area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini knows the meaning of this magic message and can’t help but say, “Isn’t this all exposed?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson glanced at Minnie and smiled and said, "Don't be naive. What else do we know the other party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Warlock subconsciously turns the magic ring on his finger and constantly thinks about the situation in front of him, saying: "...all my people are summoned, but it is also a gesture, indicating me. I have completely acknowledged the failure and will not do anything anymore. Only in this way can the other party temporarily put down a fatal blow that may come at any time. Moreover, this is also to alarm the upper blue, let them do something. If they do If you don't do it, it is the most terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Stevenson almost admitted that all actions and plans failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he thought of another possibility. The heart secretly cursed the old mage who led him to visit the dark blue at the beginning. He learned from this rapper that "Licha is the future builder" and got some incidental news, such as Richard is a person in dark blue. Study. And he actually believed so much, and later did not think of going to verify. A direct family member of a large family patriarch is an important figure trained as a future architect. How can there be no manpower around? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson judges the Archimonde family in the dark blue, at least more than the blood parrots, their group of 10 to 14 killers Double, this is not too much power to worry about, but now a little man around him can't resist it. Although the deep blue does not allow direct violence, the fuse can be ignited by him. The dark blue does not even need to intervene. It only needs to remain silent... I think here, the dragon and the warlock who did not invade the cold and the cold hit a cold war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the warriors entered the residential area. His face was very ugly, the eye frame was deeply immersed, his eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes, and he apparently spent the night in anxiety. As soon as he saw Stevenson, he immediately squatted and said heavily: "Young Master, I haven't got any news yet, I am going to go out and explore myself..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevenson waved to stop him and said, "You don't have to probe, and you will take your people back. All the orders have been cancelled before. What should you do? Just do it when you are not in peace." If... If you hear something occasionally, then let me know, but don’t try to inquire about it, do you understand?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrior At first it was a little confused, and then I understood the meaning of Stevenson's words, and my face could not help but be more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson looked at the magic clock and frowned. He said, "What about the divine? How has he not arrived yet?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Stevenson waited to get impatient, the wizard finally arrived. He looked in mysteriously dragging a large rectangular box and placed it on the ground carefully before he took a tribute to Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master, this thing was discovered by chance. It is said to be a magical figure that Richard used. Because there is no repair value, it was originally prepared to be returned. But I think it is very valuable and needs to be given to you. Look, it took 30,000 gold coins to buy it," said the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand gold coins? Even in the dark blue, a magical figure is only a thousand gold coins, not to mention the magic doll that can not be repaired? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson and Minnie are both curious about the doll itself, only the warriors questioned the price the the the the the the the the the the A puppet whose original cost does not exceed 2,000 gold coins is bought back with 30,000 gold coins. The difference between them is too much corruption. Both the magnitude and the absolute number are beyond the limits that Stevenson can tolerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer knows that this accusation is so powerful that he can no longer make a mystery, and quickly take out the doll and explain it quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original magician who was responsible for destroying the magical dolls was the black gold assistant. He was always wondering how grinning the used dolls. . And his men had friends with the sorcerer, so the sorcerer came over the first time. The assistant and the gray dwarf share a common feature, that is, they have almost paranoid insistence on obeying the rules of dark blue, but they are not completely unshakable, as long as the offer price is sufficient. After looking at the dolls used by Richard, the oracle immediately decided to bring it to Stevenson, so there was an incredible price of 30,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the doll was taken out, Stevenson was attracted by the damage and scars that were everywhere. The mottled blood stains above look shocking. He reached out and gently touched the depression on the doll and asked the comrade: "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comrades were very dignified and said: I don't see any special attacks against the vital parts. They should all be indiscriminately hit. But the power is amazing. Only the well-trained ten-level fighters can explode such power. This doll should have the standard knight half body. A has the same defensive power, that is to say, Richard's power has reached the point where he can be a boxing knight. But he is not a magic apprentice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although it is already quite certain that the end of the matter, but seeing this person, the judgment of the process of things seems to have turned to a strange direction, and Stevenson once again felt the chill of the heart. A magic apprentice with the power of a tenth-level warrior? In fact, it is not so incredible, but pure power, racial talent, blood ability, and even some powerful magic items can be provided. The question is, is there still a lot of secrets that he does not know around him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Stevenson felt that he might have chosen the wrong opponent. But this is not something he can choose. After all, he is only a self-funded student, and Su Helun will only train a builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you give it to me soon?!" Stevenson snarled at the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oracle is really speechless. He also got the news that he got this morning. It’s enough to be able to highlight the ability at this time. Maybe earlier? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the anger of Stevenson was slightly calm, the comrades reminded: "Young master, the head of the doll..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson noticed that this is a headless doll. It should have been the most important head. I don’t know where to go. The neck incision is very smooth, no other. The incision on one side is compared, and it is impossible to determine how it is removed. Seeing Stevenson's gaze look at himself, the oracle immediately said: "It is said that this doll's head is very special, so Black Gold took it as a private collection. I asked Black Gold's assistant. This head belongs to the kind of collection that can be transferred, but the price may be very expensive, at least 100,000 gold coins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
