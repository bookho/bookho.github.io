			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Elf Guardian maintains the necessary etiquette and respect, yet extremely determined Rejected Richard, this is the arrogance of the high elves, they regard any race as the inferior creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Merline, let her come to see me." Richard's voice has turned cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Melin is now attending the Presbyterian Church. She may not be able to come to see you. When the Presbyterian Church is over, I will inform her the first time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He interrupted his words and said: "The so-called Presbyterians mean that they don't want me to enter the tribe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf guard was stunned and apparently told by Richard, but he immediately piled up the elf’s typical top-down smile, saying: "Mr. Richard, Wait for the elders to end...呃,.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has already taken the neck of the Elf Guard, put him in the air, and put the elf in great power All the words of the guards were returned to the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding night warriors were shocked and pulled out their swords. The two shooters were full of war bows and kept going backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the surrounding soldiers, Richard raised his voice and said: "The elders have left their lives, and I will come to shelter the Yongye tribe in the future. The guys who are prepared to abide by the great elders will be regarded as rebellious, and the traitor’s end will be the right to die and lose the tree of life. I don’t want to hurt the elders of the elders, but I will never tolerate them. Rebellious, here, my last suggestion is, don't try to challenge my bottom line, never."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, regardless of warrior, civilian or child, The eternal night elves who heard it were shocked and killed. It is the most severe punishment to return to the tree of life. In the traditional concept of the eternal night elf, death is just the beginning of another reincarnation, as long as it dies. Next to the tree of life, the soul can enter the tree of life and be reborn in some form in the newly born elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly slowed down his right hand and five fingers, the elf guard fell to the ground, immediately tumbling violently, his hands tightly holding his throat, desperately sucking Qi, but nothing can not be sucked in, although Richard released his hand, but the power wrapped around the neck of this Elf guard made him still unable to breathe, and he would suffocate and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night warriors around him were shocked, but most of them hesitated and did not do it. Although the special relationship between Li and Richard was not explained, many of the night elves were in the eyes, but a shooter’s eyes flashed fiercely. The hand that buckled the string was loose, and the long arrow shot at the heart of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." "What are you doing?" Several Elf guards yelled, but they had no time to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard does not realize that the long arrow hits less than three meters from him, he falls into an invisible defensive force, the speed drops sharply, and finally becomes The speed of the turtle, and the arrow on the body swept a touch of bright red, then violently burned, the sound of a bang into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and looked at the elf shooter with no expression, and spit out a word coldly: "Rebellious."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t see any movement from Richard. A pale gray ball that is almost invisible to the naked eye shot at the elf shooter. He suddenly felt a very strong death threat and screamed. Suddenly flashed to the side, but the speed of the gray ball is several times his speed. In the air, he has caught up with the shooter and has not entered his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooter is distorted by the whole person, like to be integrated into another world, a large piece of red floats out of his body and condenses into a big bloody ball in the air, and The shooter fell down and instantly became a dry corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding night elves are silent, some people have recognized the magic used by Richard, flesh and blood, horrible undead magic, can make the target body All the liquids are out of the body, killing the target. Although this magic is only seven levels, the horrible killing effect makes it less famous than some nine-level magic. The night elf is a member of the Silver Moon Elves. There are many wizards in the Greenson plane, but the Green Forest environment is more suitable for the growth of Druid. Therefore, the Master in the Yongyao tribe becomes less and less with the passage of time, so the wizard who knows this magic is not Less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the body of Richard as the center, and a faint light curtain spread out, instantly covering the area within 20 meters, all in this area forever The night elves felt that the body was numb, and they were fixed in place. They could not move. They were not only warriors and shooters, but even two druids were nailed to the original place and became a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group paralysis is not a rare magic, only six levels, but the coverage is so large, the spells are so powerful, the group is paralyzed, but the night elves We have never seen it, especially the Druids who are good at natural forces are extremely powerful against magic. The failure rate of single paralysis is also more than half, not to mention group spells, but Richard is an instant. The group's paralysis was carried out in the past, and as long as the eternal night elves that were affected were tied to the original place, no one could be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard walked to the tree of life in the same way, until he stepped on the ladder leading to the canopy, and the group of eternal night elves were still in a state of paralysis, and all the night elves looked at Richard’s gaze. There is no arrogance and hostility in the midst of it, but instead it is deeply feared. The eternal elves are all soldiers and have complete magical inheritance. Most people know the meaning behind the paralysis that can't be lifted in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible wave spread from Richard, and the entire Yongyue village was covered by Richard’s perception, and his mind was fretting. It is noticed that the warrior's breath is unusually small. The entire Yongye tribe's warriors are still in the life tree range, only half of the normal number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With doubts, Richard went straight to the top, and the so-called Presbyterian Church was held in the largest tree house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven elves in the tree house, where Melin and Carla are among them. These seven elves are the elders of the Yongye tribe, when they are there. The Yongyue tribe does not have a presbyterian church. The elders are responsible for one transaction. The final decision-making power is all in one hand. At this moment, the atmosphere inside the tree house is very tense. The central position is a middle-aged elf. Simply stood up and said: "The sky is the artifact of our elves, and we must never give it to humans. We are also noble elves of noble blood, and we cannot surrender to a human being."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline also stood up and said with anger: "This is the life of the elders, and you dare not follow them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elf said quietly: "Why did the elders' legacy, I didn't see it, where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline said, said: "I am not handing it over to you... you, you dare to hide the fate of the elders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged Elves: Unfortunately, I did not receive the death of the elders. As the closest relative of the elders, the sky of the sky should be kept by me for the time being. After the elders will elect a new elder, they will be handed over to the new elders. In charge, Mei Lin, this artifact is not in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray feather, you..." Melin was shocked and angry. I don’t know what to say at the moment. The elf named Gray Feather is a sly scorpion. Mei Lin didn’t think he would suddenly jump out to fight for the sky, but he didn’t even think it would be so rogue. Most of his life was secretly smashed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Feather ignored Melin, but said loudly: "Elders, now we should first vote whether the Presbyterian Church should keep the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the tree house, six arms were raised high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the voice of Gray Feather: "Next, we should consider talking to the Yi language tribe and end the war."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was lifted with five arms, and Melin’s eyes were still desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the tree house was suddenly kicked open, and then the voice of Richard was heard: "Who dares to speak with the proverb." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray feathers are clear to the people, "Tru, how are you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why can't it be me, I won't come back again, I will have a new big elder in the night." Richard stared at the gray feathers and said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray feather calm down, his face sinks and shouted: "This is our long-night tribe. You are just a foreigner. You are not eligible to come here." The place, leave immediately, otherwise I will call the guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and threw a piece of paper in front of the gray feather and said: Leaving, this is the letter that the elders left for me. You can see it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray feather took the letter and quickly glanced at it, that is He gave Richard a private letter, which contained the content that led the leader to lead the Yongye tribe out of the predicament. The handwriting on the letter was indeed the handwriting of the cockroach. The gray feathers were wrinkled, and the letter was torn apart and then said: How can I not see the elders' suicide note?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately swept a layer of frost on his face, and he said: "I didn't see it, that What do you want these eyes to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray feathers suddenly changed, because Richard had already stood in front of him, and the two noses almost met one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven elves in the tree house, no one saw how the appearance of Richard appeared in front of the gray feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
