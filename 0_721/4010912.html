			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this holy white shining hall, you can see the sacred kingship And the entangled pattern of the right to teach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the royal family is the blood of the Glorious Lord God and other heavenly people. Because of this, the users of the heavenly kingdoms of the past are often from the royal lineage. The jihadist angels such as Ulle, Gabriel and Raphael simply became the inheritance of generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet meeting should have been an internal meeting of the dynasty, but in fact, the ministers including the prime minister, the military and internal affairs, and the four great dukes can only Sitting on the right side of the long table, and the left side is the location of the church staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a voice in the cabinet meeting, and even the right to vote on matters involving the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this meeting, the left side is empty, sitting in the seven positions of the Pope and St. Martin, others such as Lufide, St. Thomas, etc. None of the people who should be listed did not attend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor looked like he was about 50 years old, his body was obviously fat, but he had not yet reached the point of Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Philip’s efforts to lay the foundation of Xu’s first rise, his motto of decisive power was set off in the mainland aristocracy for a while. The wind is beautiful with fat. There are not many people who want to eat fat, but many fat people can look up from now on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dynasty of this emperor named Louis XIII, he is not stupid, but there has been no dazzling act. In fact, under the constraints of the Guangming Church, it is not easy for the emperor to want to make a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louisteen sat down at the end of the long table, first glanced at the people present. Sitting on his right hand side is full, while the left hand side is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Louis XIII revealed a smile that was not easy to detect, and then he slammed his face and tapped the table gently. The cabinet meeting began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Grand Duke first said: "You must severely punish Richard! The crime of murdering the Marquis of the dynasty must not be forgiven. Otherwise, this precedent is opened, is it not for the dynasty nobles?" Everyone is at risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Grand Duke echoed: "We should seriously consider the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two recent cabinet meetings basically started this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two heated discussions, severe punishment of Richard is already a consensus, but there are serious differences in how to severely punish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great duchess from the south and the military ministers advocated the dynasty aristocracy as the mainstay, and went to Akmon. However, the two great dukes and the interior ministers in the north strongly opposed it. They believed that the dynasty and the church should jointly send troops, and even the church power. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences between the two sides are clear at a glance, the Minister of Military Affairs is also from the southern aristocracy, the South is very far away from Richard, and the dynasty sent troops, in fact, the main force is the private army of the major lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is that the northern lords and Archimonde have been playing for a year or two. At that time, Alice was gradually accumulating the territory and resources by the war with the northern nobles of the Holy Tree Dynasty and climbed to the Earl position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s administration, Ellie suddenly became strong and strong, and the number was in quantity, equipped with equipment, and the Knights had a construction knight. At one time, the border lords headed by the Duke of Soram in the north were suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent contraction of Archimonde from the Holy Alliance dú lì occurred, and the 'Wujin War' triggered by the Marquis of Brahms twice During the war, Richard invaded the lords of the northern sacred dynasty, and the total loss of the lord's private army totaled more than 400,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the northern aristocrats have been scared by Richard. In the past, when Ellie led the army, both sides could still pull back and saw, and scored several rounds to win or lose. But when the war arrived in the hands of Richard, the Archimonde army became completely flawless, and the combat power was soaring and soaring. Even the two-on-one was defeated. How could this be played? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the two great dukes of the north resolutely disagreed with the dynasty-based troop-contribution plan. Under this scheme, the south again said that the troops were limited and suffered losses. In the end it is still north. The north and south nobles of the dynasty are not in harmony with each other. Once the power is out of balance to some extent, there may be other situations that are not intended. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the meeting proposed a plan to send troops from the church, but the pope was stunned and slumbered, only said that this matter must be decided at the cardinal meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, everyone knows that in the last battle of the Wujin War, the cardinal of the church all died, when will the resolution of the cardinal meeting be obtained? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet Minister and the lords looked at Martin and the Pope's eyes quite strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the final battle, there were hundreds of thousands of aristocratic private troops present. Everyone saw that the war actually evolved into a church civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Pope and the Son, who played your life and death, did not happen in the blink of an eye, sitting together in the cabinet meeting, which makes people think How awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final meeting was stuck on how to send troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this week’s cabinet meeting will be disappointing again, a big duke in the north snorted and looked at St. Martin, his eyes gradually It’s fierce: "His Royal Highness, I heard that the battle that day, you are actually standing on the side of Richard. Now when discussing how to punish Archimonde, the church is always pushing the responsibility, no reason is there. What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally said it on my head..." St. Martin stretched out and sat up straight. Looking back at the big duke. His face always had a smile, but this eye caused the big duke of the north to suddenly chill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s eyes swept over the lords and the three ministers in front of him, and then said to Louis XIII: “Your Majesty, I confess that when the war occurs, our church There are contradictions in the interior. However, the war is a disagreement within the church. Simply put, it is our servant who is the master of the Lord, and has a disagreement on how to better carry out the will of the Glorious Lord, but the differences are a bit big. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Martin's statement, the lords are all disapproving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences are indeed a bit big, to the point where four jihad angels, an archangel, and all cardinals have been lost. If you want to do more big things, it is really difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Saint Martin smiled and asked: "You adults, are you interested in participating in the differences of the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke and the ministers suddenly took a look at the church and participated in the church fight? They don't have this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords and ministers who can sit here are all aware of the bad guy behind the church. On the surface, it is the war between the Pope and the Son. In fact, it must be that the various factions of the heavens are fighting behind the scenes. This kind of water mixing is of course less good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the lords had shrunk back, Martin smiled and said: "It was indeed a dispute within the church, and Richard was willing to stand on my side. As for his subsequent killing of the Marquis of Brahms, this matter has nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since St. Martin’s attitude has been set, the lords They are all relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have always been worried about this inscrutable Son. The results of the internal wars in the church are well known, and Saint Martin can be said to be a great victory. Just wait for the right time to force the Pope to abdicate, then he will be converted from the Son to the Pope. If the Bright Church insists on standing on the side of Richard, then the punishment can only be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin said slowly: "I must remind you that the strength of Archimonde is almost completely unharmed. The loss of the private army is quite heavy. Is it appropriate to rush to launch a war?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually the reason why the two great duches in the north strongly opposed the dynasty’s main war. . They need time to recuperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Minister of Military Affairs coughed and said: "The Highness of the Son is very reasonable. In the Ujin War, Archimonde’s loss is far. Far less than the loss that should be. The noble lords of the North need time to re-arm their troops. So what we need now is time. I suggest that the northern lords rebuild the army, and the lords of the South, in addition to providing half of the weapons and equipment, The Duke should also provide two planes of the year to the northern lords. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good advice!" The Grand Duke immediately agreed, and their pressure to expand the army was suddenly reduced by a third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two great Dukes of the South thought about it and felt it was appropriate. After all, if they don't contribute, the North is absolutely unwilling to move. Want to use the hand of Archimonde to weaken the North? Nobody can be fooled by such obvious traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
