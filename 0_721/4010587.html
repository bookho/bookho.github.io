			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan, standing behind Richard, was shocked and exclaimed: "Golden World Tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and looked at the seed that had just given birth to a young leaf and said, "Yes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the symbol of Elf Wang Ting, how can it fall into your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" An accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan was silent for a while, and the light in the eyes flashed, then said: "This plane should also have a world tree. A sub-plane like this should have only one world tree, how do you plant it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said "I just want to let the world tree know that there is no room for compromise in this war. I will root it up sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waving, a team of 50 squadrons are led by ten elite knights. Over trees guarding the gold in the world, and Richard Nolan then went to the second batch of the starting team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked back at the guardian's squadron and asked, "Let's put it here, can you do it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as the precious thing of the Golden World Tree, it is impossible to guard a 10,000-strong army. In the era of the Elven Empire, it was guarded by several high elves. Now that Richard has put dozens of knights, it is too unscrupulous. Since the golden world tree has been planted, another world tree will use all means to try to destroy it. How to defend it is not Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha mysteriously smiled and said, "This is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this How can people be enough, all the Sanctuary strong is still almost, with doubts, Nolan followed Richard on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left, a few worker bees creeped out of the forest and surrounded an old tree, and they stumbled over it for a while, then Towed away, more worker bees continued to appear, and an old tree was bitten and towed away. Even the roots buried deep underground were not spared. A worker bee continued to drill in the soil. In terms of excavation, they have almost no opponents. While cleaning the roots, they are also adapting to the growth of the soil. After a while, there are thousands of worker bees busy around the golden world tree, and more worker bees are still flowing. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just 20 kilometers away, the starry sky floated silently in the air. It has shrunk to a length of 50 meters. Under the shuttle-shaped body, dozens of luminous organs like fireflies are opened, which will give a warm yellow glow. Sprinkled down, the forest has cleared a large open space, densely scattered with tens of millions of blue oocysts, under the warm glow of the stars, you can see through the translucent egg wall that it has grown Most of the creatures grow very fast, and one root is almost at the speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly an oocyst broke open, and a small spider crawled out of it. The oocyst was not the size of a fist, and the spider was about the size of a normal spider. But it is not an ordinary spider, but a bird-eating spider that once played a decisive role in the life tree. This bird spider is a complete spider form at birth, but it is much smaller than the whole body, and A white soft shell, the first thing that was born when the little spider was born, was to eat all the oocysts, and then, under the guidance of the stars, crossed the open space and climbed to the forest. It was on the first tree side. Stopped and started eating. After a while, another bird-eating spider larva appeared next to it. Then, a bird-eating spider larva appeared constantly, and in a blink of an eye, the whole tree was covered, and the tree body became white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oocysts began to break open in large pieces, and young bird-eaters such as white tides rushed to the forest, where there was endless food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky floats quietly in the sky, shining on the ocean below the bird's spider, the light that emits energy to the bird's spiders while accelerating their Growing, these bird-eaters are re-analyzed and nurtured according to the results of the last war. Their initial form has become smaller and they need to be taken care of more. They must be illuminated by the stars. It hatches in the oocysts, and the cycle of eating and growing becomes longer, and it will be fully matured after seven times of molting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the bird's adaptability to the environment is much worse, but the benefits of this improvement are enormous, first of all, the mother nest cultivates the oocysts. The energy consumed is greatly reduced. The 9th-order hen nest can produce 500 oocysts per day, which can quickly form a large scale. The longer growth cycle means that the bird-eating spider will become more powerful, in fact Combat strength assessment, the second generation of bird-eating spiders is more than half of the first generation, and their number is several times that of the first generation. As for the large amount of food needed for growth, it is not a problem in the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingyi brought over 10,000 oocysts this time, and after ten days, they will become mature bodies with good fighting power, thirty days later, It is a complete body with powerful combat power. The nets of the bird-eater spiders, the poisonous spit and the sharp blade are all deadly weapons. They can not only deal with the coffin crow, but also have the lethal effect on other creatures. It is the force that protects the tree of life, and it can also be the horrible force that guards the golden tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard said that this "person" is enough, but this scene, Richard is not ready to let Nolan see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the nest is slamming into the sixth order. It is already a huge monster of more than 50 meters, which is not much worse than the star. However, it does not have the same hard-wearing insects as the mother's nest body. The body surface is more of a hard-resisting hard skin. Until now, the nest is still creating worker bees every time. When upgrading, it also chose to enhance the creative ability of various units. Perhaps it is specialized in this. The ability of the mother's nest to create combat units at this moment has been directly pursued. It can now produce five nine-level ones per day. The combat unit, the lower the level of the combat units produced, the more the number, the more the level of the combat unit can be reduced by one level, the number can be two more. In the ability to manufacture low-level combat units, the avatar even exceeds the body, now When manufacturing worker bees, it can make a full twenty eight at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vicinity of the avatar, there has been an area of ​​one square kilometer of open space, but from the perspective of the entire forest, this open space is even smaller than the water in the sea. The number of worker bees in Linhaizhong has been close to 2,000. The high-energy beeswax secreted by them has already piled up into a hill, and they have not even had time to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy of avatar has been approved by Richard. In the next month, it will always manufacture worker bees, and worker bees have giant pythons that can bite rocks. It is also possible to bite through the armor. When the number of worker bees reaches an order of magnitude, nothing will stop their advancement. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this round of counterattack, Richard did not intend to use the power of the mother's nest. The troops that started first advanced very fast. They used explosives made of dark blue. Sticking to a big tree, it ignites directly. The violent explosion will directly blow off most of the trees. Although a few too thick trees are not broken, but the strong soldiers come up and slash a few axes, they will be cut down. At this time, Xingyi brought in dozens of tons of improved gunpowder made from rock wood. The explosive power of the new gunpowder has weakened, but the manufacturing difficulty has also dropped drastically. The corresponding output has soared dozens of times, assisted by gunpowder. Next, the advancement of the first force is very fast. The most time-consuming task is to push the fallen giant tree to both sides of the road. In this way, in the continuous roar, a road quickly extends in the forest, when Richard leads When the second batch of troops caught up, the leading troops had reached into the forest for dozens of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directed the troops to open a 10m wide corridor in the forest. Such a narrow passage could not completely block the forest will, but it also weakened to a considerable extent. Thus, the coverage of the Holy Unicorn has been expanded several times, and the front-end troops have been fully protected, while the follow-up troops have been supervised by the priests brought by Nolan to counter the oppression of the forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
