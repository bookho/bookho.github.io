			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Midsummer Carnival Night has also become a strong brand in Richard’s heart. a moment. Until he returned to the residential area, he still had something unbelievable that had just happened. Everything is so incredible, but the neck of the fire dragon is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This million-dollar fire-necked neck skin was curled up by the mountains and the sea, and was given to him as a gift. Richard opened the neck and placed it on a large workbench, gently stroking it with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon neck skin has nearly two square meters, and it occupies more than half of the table. It is dark red in color, and has a bright red line. When it is completely spread, the faint red light shines through the surface. Even under the magic light that is bright like sunlight, it can not cover the misty If the real light. When Richard's hand stroking, the fingertips can feel the burning flame power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon neck skin is the most precious material touched by Richard in his life. With his hand stroking, a lot of data is constantly flowing, let Lee It is becoming more and more familiar with its characteristics. If you use this skin as a raw material, many of Richard's ideas will become reality, at least 30% of the grasp can be made to make the snow rabbit defeat the winter wolf's magic pattern. However, this skin is unknown, at least in the mind of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard is very willing to become friends with the mountains and the sea. Of course, being a man is another matter. But now, he still can't determine the true meaning of the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you care, you can feel the sincerity and simplicity of the barbarian girl. However, if we use the wisdom and reason formed by human beings for many years, we will think that there must be conspiracy behind the girl’s move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has his own principles and ways of thinking, that is to become friends with the mountains and the sea, but not ready to use her mountain and sea-like wealth. Although he is still young, the big framework of thoughts and principles has been shaped by Ilanni in his childhood and has been somewhat influenced by the shadow of Gordon Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being sent to Dark Blue, Gordon Archimonde once said something that impressed Richard: "Every Archimonde heart There is a kind of boiling pride. They prefer to use their own hands to open up a world and not to use the power of others. This has its advantages and disadvantages. The downside is that Archimonde will never be able to unite, the benefit is that each Archimonde, who has successfully stood up, is daunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Moon Elf is of course proud, but indifferent. The pursuit of perfection from the blood makes it difficult for them to see others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two different prides are mixed in Richard, and he himself can’t say whether he prefers the Silver Moon Elf or prefers Archimonde some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-rolled the dragon's neck and set the magic material for the seal. If you do not use magic to seal, then the magic contained in the red neck will gradually disappear, unless you also have a half-plane to store. It was also at this time that Richard found a layer of vague power on the dragon skin, and the desolation immediately reminded him of the barbarian girl. This power is attached to the dragon skin when she gives it to Richard to protect the dragon skin from magic. When she used this thing as a shawl, she did not attach any strength. It was purely used as a common animal skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect this rampant guy to have a careful side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard unconsciously floated a smile, carefully sealed the dragon's neck, and then carefully placed it on the top of the magic material rack in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning is a full course, and time flies, and soon it’s lunch time. Every day for lunch and dinner, Richard is treated in a fighting mood. Now his recipe is no longer specially prepared by the legendary mage, but it is still adjusted by the most advanced alchemists in the dark blue. The common feature is that the consumables are expensive and the weight is amazing, so the number of people who have delivered the meal has increased. Two, and a strong black skin slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when returning to the residential area, Richard unexpectedly saw that the mountains and the sea were waiting for him at the door. She was followed by steel rock, the old man and two court guards. After bringing the girl and his wife into the residential area, Richard’s lunch was also sent by two black skin slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lunch box was set up, the girl immediately screamed and sat down at the table and said to Richard: "Please have me a meal! Please eat me. A meal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Richard still hopes to have friends. He greeted the steel rock and the old man, but was rejected by the barbarian warrior. The giant steel rock has a disdainful face for everyone, but the attitude toward Richard is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea were invited, and they immediately began to work unceremoniously. She is too lazy to use more than ten kinds of fine tableware, but really hands-on. Whether it is a dragon rib or a turtle shell, she is easily torn into pieces, thrown into the mouth, chewed and swallowed. The hot soup is poured into the mouth along with the soup inside, no matter what is inside, it is swallowed directly. The girl's teeth seem to be able to bite everything in the world, and the keel shell is in her mouth, crisp like nuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said that he wanted to visit the residential area of ​​the legendary Master disciple, and Richard quickly let them move around at will. Anyway, his information here is basic magic knowledge, and it is not a secret on the mainland of Noland. Greeting the old man and the steel rock, when Richard returned to the table, he saw that the mountains and the sea had swept away the things on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a few words...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea look at empty tableware, I also felt a little embarrassed and said, "Oh, although other aspects are not good here, but the food is really good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stood up, a Pulling Richard, he said, "Let's go, let me go to my camp. My people went fishing in the sea last night. Now, you can eat sharks and whales."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't live in dark blue?" Richard was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! What's good here, you can only see the alpine sea outside from such a big window. I like to open my eyes when I wake up. I can see the sky. In fact, the ice floes are magnificent, just a little bit worse than my hometown. Why do you want to keep yourself in such a small cage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mountains and the sea with a sincere expression, Richard is helpless and somewhat funny. He wanted to say that it is not necessary to go to the winter here, that is, in the early spring and late autumn, it will freeze people in the wild. But looking at the girl's appearance, I am afraid I don't know what cold is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the invitation of the mountains and the sea, Richard can only refuse: "No, I will go to see the teacher in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
