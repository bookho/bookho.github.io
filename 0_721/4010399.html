Putting Senma here means that she does have the ability to stand alone. From this point of view, the cost of a set of armor in exchange for the effectiveness of Senma is really another. It’s worthwhile, but what Richard is missing now is the high-end force of the Gordon thirteen knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you pay the transfer fee, the efficiency of the work can be astonishingly high. Before the afternoon, the attendant Master took the armor back, when Richard took the armor. When handed over to Senma, the blood paladin exclaimed, almost jumped up, a set of quasi-legendary gorgeous armor, the magical brilliance, the complicated and beautiful lines, dazzled her eyes, she never I didn't dream of having such a set of armor, but now it is really in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed her armor and refused to let go again. Richard smiled and looked at it all, and there was a slight satisfaction in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma hurriedly bid farewell to Richard, picking up the armor and leaving like a wind. In the evening, she had already appeared in front of Richard in a new armor, and the armor had already After re-engineering and remodeling, it has completely changed its appearance, becoming more gorgeous, exposed, and the lines are smoother and more beautiful than the original armor. In such a short period of time, it is possible to change a piece of armor so much, and Senma fully demonstrated Her master's level of craftsmanship, but Richard saw her first sight, but almost did not smother her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This armor has been transformed to become more gorgeous and eye-catching, but at the cost of a comprehensive decline in defensive and magical effects, instantly falling from the legendary level As far as the level of ordinary epic armor is concerned, Richard is able to see it. Senma is as beautiful as it can be, and other things can be sacrificed. Now, he will understand how the original armor of Senma is going on, and Gotton certainly will not send it. This kind of flashy thing is Senma's own modification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is Senma’s own business. No matter what the armor is changed, at least it has achieved its due effect: turning Senma into follower . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day later, the followers of Richard finally gathered together. The group took a large number of knights and knights and entered the Hulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughland is winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the portal, the face was a cold wind, let him glimpse, the whole person tightened a little, has not experienced for a long time After such a chilling winter, this reminded Richard of the deep blue, and also remembered the village of Rutherland. The winter in the mountains is always extraordinarily cold. In the cold wind, the young Richard has developed the first perseverance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning to Shulan, Senma was the first to walk out of the portal, which actually shows that she and Lina are different, Senma seems to be big and brainless. In fact, the details are handled very well, and the Master Long is often ignorant, so that Richard just went to Greenson and almost ate a big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane portal is built in a large hall in the inner city of the base city. This hall is not magnificent, nor luxurious, even the most basic decoration. It’s just shabby. The hall can play a role in sheltering the wind and rain, but it depends on the circumstances. It’s only a small square of nearly 100 square meters. When you build it, there is no investment plane. The plan of the passage, if there are only a few, and at most a dozen people enter and exit through the plane channel, there is really no need to build the temple to be particularly large. It can be seen that the embarrassment of the Gordon era, Gordon probably never thought about it, one day You can reinforce the plane channel to the point where you can pass hundreds or even thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is nothing wrong with Gordon’s practice. So far, no one has found any special products, even if Gordon has occupied a small half. The same is true, so Shulan can provide hundreds of thousands of gold coins every year, but this is already the limit. In the eyes of Gordon, it is better to lay down the entire plane. Most of the mountains are mountains and hills, and the smaller ones are the snow mountains where the nest is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, through the calculation of the plane mathematics, Richard found that Hulan was a little weird, and the shape of the snow-capped mountain gave Richard a strong sense of foreboding. Where did he find something, so Richard cast a heavy bet on the one hand to find out the true secrets of Hulan, and on the other hand to completely occupy the plane, thus liberating Senma, and Richard is now extremely lacking in a single side. People, if Senma can defend the Black Rose Castle, then Ellie can be completely liberated, this is the real killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, his holy unicorn, then Tiramisu drilled out of the portal, the double-headed ogre squeezed the portal, and immediately took a breath and stretched out, only Listening to the bang, the three-pointed unicorn hit the top of the temple and put a big hole in the ceiling. The ogre was still ignorant and said: "How suddenly it is dark."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha cried and laughed, the ogre is now over four meters long, is a huge behemoth, but less than four meters high hall can not accommodate it, and look at Tiramis Su's body shape is also difficult to squeeze out the temple door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the door of the main hall and said to the guard’s guard: "Call some people to take this transfer hall apart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards glimpsed for a moment, did not figure out why a hall suddenly broke down, and they did not know who Richard is, as a soldier who was stationed in the Hughland plane all year round, they There is no chance to go to Noland through the portal, and it is naturally impossible to know Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you going to take it apart?" Semma asked puzzledly, this hall was built in the days of Gordon, a rather extravagant facility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's too small, it has to be expanded here, or how to pass my army, after the demolition, build a new one." It was decided to rebuild the transfer hall and the surrounding buildings without any cost or cost. This is his typical style and a sign of deliberate separation from Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu screamed, the bow ran two steps, and the body slammed into the wall, and the slamming, the transfer hall immediately fell half, the cannibal The magic is now infinite, and the building's transfer hall was not built to be particularly strong, so there was no difference between him and the paper paste. Tiramisu even pushed the shackles, and later he picked up an epic-level warhammer. In the smoke and smoke, the transfer hall was turned into ruins in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the ogre is too big, and many people are rushing to see the huge figure raging in the ruins, all subconsciously holding Tightened the weapon, but did not dare to move a little. Many people were sweating nervously. Many of them were veterans. They clearly felt the horrible tyranny of Tiramisu, Tiramis. Su's body size is too big, it is so chilling, such as trolls, giants, ogres and other powerful natural creatures, there is a very simple standard of judgment, that is, the more huge, the strength The more terrible, Tiramisu is already too big to subvert people's common sense of the ogre, it is a rare double-headed ogres, once the launch of Weilai, hundreds of human elite warriors may not be its opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Tiramisu was dismantled and ready to start with the adjacent building, Richard had to stop it: "Tiramisu, yes, the rest is left to other people to do it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu grabbed his head and said: "I am not tired, head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are not tired, go to the side and let the people behind come out." Under the command of Richard, the ogre had to give up the area in front of the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard were able to walk out of the portal, each with a variety of shapes, but with powerful followers, let the onlookers The Husband veterans subconsciously held their breath, and the people who came down from the battlefield knew very well how terrible the opponents with this momentum would be. On the other hand, the number of followers made them more suspicious. They are very clear about how much this means a transfer fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans’ eyes on Richard’s eyes have turned from abhorence to fear. In private discussions, they already know the identity of Richard, but the song Don’s son doesn’t mean anything. Gordon has several sons. When Richard went into the blue plane, the first thing was to demolish a building in the Gordon period, which naturally made many people unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not have the heart to decide whether these veterans would be obedient, but to end in person, and a group of followers to clean up the ruins in front of the portal. Constantly expanding the space outside the portal, seeing Richard's hands, Senma also came to help, and the veterans still hesitated, they still do not accept Richard from the bottom of their hearts, not accepting a sudden change of a lord, Richard Both the followers and the followers had strong force and quickly cleared a large open space. Richard ordered the removal of two nearby buildings and formed a small square in front of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the one-piece knights were able to walk out of the plane-transmitting door, a whole hundred knights, when they stood together, that The depressing pressure seems to be to crush people. After the formation of the knight, there are more elite knights. Although they are far less powerful than the knights, they are naturally indifferent. The momentum is even more daunting, and the number is far better than the costume knight. Even the statue of the Knights under Richard’s structure is somewhat unnatural. The results of the war between Richard and Goliath have already come. These are not afraid of death. The squadron knight is considered to be the nemesis of the knight, and it has the title of a knight meat grinder. Even if it is as strong as a knight, it is never willing to fight these madmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
