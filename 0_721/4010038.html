Therefore, the general principle of overflow is always followed by the principle of overflow. Although the control ability of the sand is already good, the power of each spell is almost negligible, but there is still more than the overflow of common spells when boiling. I don't know why, as a magician, I can fuse my power. After absorbing this power, Richard's induction of the water blue star is strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard ended his meditation, it was nine o'clock the next morning. He had just left the door, and Oral, who had been waiting at the door for a long time, informed Richard. In the early morning, a unit of the Duke of the Wolf had arrived at the Blue Water Oasis. They brought a crucial sacrifice this time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and immediately hurried down the stairs. In the courtyard of the hotel, three special-purpose trucks have been parked there. More than a dozen knights with a full-armed armor system are guarding the van. These knights have even more than ten levels of strength, and murderous, apparently killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tower-like knight standing in the courtyard, talking about what the sand is saying. When Richard’s gaze fell on the knight, he suddenly felt his eyes sour and almost shed tears. Richard was shocked. The knight’s power was very strong. Just relying on the instinctive counterattack of the air-powered traction, the Richard, who was too close, had a dark loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight turned his head, and the electric gaze stared at Richard, which converges on his momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the 40-year-old heavy armored knight who was covered with steel whiskers and recognized the moon bear Lord Levi, who had seen him at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two men had a ritual, the Lord of the Month was even omitted, and said: "Sir Richard, I am escorting these sacrifices at the order of the Duke. The Duke will arrive three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken aback and asked: "Dukes will come?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Moon nodded and said, "Yes! When the Duke wants to arrive, you can prepare the necessary ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Moon did not say what the ceremony was, but Richard certainly understood. And the Lord of the Moon, although it is the confidant of the Duke of the Wolf, can not let him know the details of the sacrifice, this matter is too important after all. However, for the sake of confidentiality, the place that originally promised to build the altar was in the territory of Richard. Now it seems that the Duke has changed his mind. Is there a new trend in the Sequoia Kingdom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, Richard is still concerned about the situation in the kingdom. Although the news is not smooth enough, it is still a little bit of a harvest. For example, from several inconsistent intelligences, Richard has accidentally interpreted some interesting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron of Fontaine is one of the largest weapons and equipment production sites in the Sequoia Kingdom, and the Kane Horn of Charles is another considerable source of production. It is said that in recent years, one of the largest copper-iron mines that Charles relied on has been depleted, and that the mountain has a branch that is located in the new territory of Richard, which was originally named the Duke of the Wolf but has not been developed. The most interesting thing is that the mines of the above two mines and the Baron of Fontaine belong to the same mountain system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the Kane Horn is known as the Three Earl's Consortium, the Earl of the King, the Count of the King, the Earl of the Highlands, the priest, the Count of the Count And the strength of the female Earl Pamela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, not only the Viscount of Heim is the war that Richard needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the whole event was filled with a rich conspiracy. However, Richard did not spend much energy to guess whether the Duke knew anything, as long as it proved that his strategy of moving to the blood-stained land was correct. The most important thing at the moment is still to seize the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir Richard, look at the offerings first! This is a list." Lord Moon Bear interrupted Richard's thoughts and handed him a scroll. Then he ordered all the guards to go to the yard to guard, and shut the door by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the scroll, and the scroll immediately showed a magical image. It was the skeleton of a dragon. Although it was incomplete, it still feels like that. A sultry atmosphere. After the magic image flashes a few times, it depletes the magic and turns it into a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the van and opened the wagon with the help of Lord Moon Bear to reveal the skeleton that was removed and stored inside. At the moment when the carriage opened, a powerful pressure sprayed out and made Richard look slightly white. That is the residual Longwei, although this dragon has been preserved for a long time, but Longwei still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a dragon! So, did the Duke win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Moon Sighed and said: "Win, but it is a tragedy. There are only two of the four Knights who went out. There are more than 4,000 soldiers who lost this battle. Many of them are the most elite. The veterans. After all, we waited for the entire White Rock Principality to attack the enemy, and the number of enemies far exceeded us. The castle of Earl of Galleon was famous for its easy-to-follow and difficult attack. Just under the castle, we left more than a thousand The body. Actually, I still don’t understand until now, what is it for launching such a big battle. Just to get back these bones? If anyone dares to deceive the Duke, let me know, I must first dismantle him. The bones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Lord Moon’s tone has some questioning meaning, looking to Richard’s eyes as shining, even more vague The violent pressure is released. Richard understands that in the eyes of the Lord, whose power has entered the sanctuary, he may have become a traitor clown character who confuses the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret between Richard and the Duke is naturally impossible for the Duke to know. Such as the old-fashioned Sanctuary, such as the Lord of the Bears, of course, also looked down on Richard, a small pioneer who did not know where to come from. It is normal to be convinced, and even Richard does not doubt that if the Lord Bear bears grasp any tangible evidence, he may even report to the Duke, but directly kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and greeted the Lord of the Moon, and he did not give up this time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of two people are in the air, almost wipe out the electric fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and said, "Lord Lord, have you heard of the Black Wing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lord&Loss said: "That is a mad dog, of course I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked relaxed and said: "You said this crazy dog, I have just cut the dog's head a few days ago and have already hanged outside the city to show the crowd. Didn't you see it when you entered the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Month He certainly knows how difficult it is to kill the Black Wing. The important figures of the Sequoia Kingdom have died in more than one black wing, but the Black Wing has been living well. A fifteen-level killer is often even more terrible than the ordinary sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
