			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight pulls out the short sword, Link’s body slowly falls to the ground Only a trace of blood was seen from the wound in the vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the main hall, an elderly mage glanced at Link’s body and hurried away. When he walked out of the hall, Richard suddenly Looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large-scale execution ceremonial ceremony ended in a smooth and smooth manner, but it surprised all aristocratic audiences, but since Melan The dukes did not have an accident. Those little aristocrats who were dissatisfied with Richard were even more afraid. The body of Link was not cold. It kept reminding people that Richard is now facing provocation. What is the attitude with the attack, in fact, Archimonde's attitude has never changed, only to have the strength to implement it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution ended smoothly, and Richard can say that stepping on Link’s body and the dignity of Mailon shows the people of Akmen now with the floating island. The location matches the strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Chinese house of the Meilun family, the Duke is sitting in the study, facing the philosophy and history of the entire wall, and the door of the study is gently tapped. Loud, the close-fitting servant came in and said softly: "Master Kabie has returned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the Duke of Melan rushed out of the study, from the punishment of God The old magician who slipped out of the temple was waiting in the living room where he was going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, is Link’s soul rescued?" The Duke hurriedly asked. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master smiled and took out a crystal ball, placed on the coffee table, the gray ball in the crystal ball, completely without the spark of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The Duke naturally knew the usage of the crystal ball and immediately knew that Link’s soul had not been stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master said: "The short knife of the sin is the power to attack the soul. In terms of attributes, it is somewhat like the annihilation of the Xiong Peter family. At the moment when Link died, his soul was torn into pieces. I managed to collect a few pieces, but I don’t know why it turned out to be like this. Most of them are Richard or his followers in the dark, but Very embarrassing, I don't know how they started and when they started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Duke of Myron could not speak. For a long time, he sighed and said: "Forget it, I thought I could get the secret of the construction workshop from the soul of Link, but now... ...唉.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Duke’s personal servant knocked on the door and said, “Adult, Richard has sent all the ransom back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke went to the window and looked out. He saw a box of rare metal and magic materials transported into the Chinese house, and he looked at it for a moment. Suddenly, a long sigh, the heart of victory with Archimonde suddenly extinguished most of the time, the Duke asked himself if he was in a different position with Richard, he was mostly difficult to give up such a heavy strategic material, everything is in the hands of Richard, even if He wanted to deduct it, and the Duke couldn't do anything for a while, but Richard sent the material back without change. The heavy weight inside made the Duke feel a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original strategic material that the Emlens family valued was not in the eyes of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the floating island and met Achilles in the study room at the first time and asked, "What have you found?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris clicked on the magic map and said, "I walked around the Wald’s relatives and found one of Wald’s previous ones. The lover, the woman gave Wald a child, and Wald was the only blood in the world, but just over a year ago, the child suddenly got a strange disease. The disease usually has no symptoms. It is maddening when it is attacked, and then it can't be cured anyway. It is said that only the medicine powder of a local mysterious witch doctor can be used to suppress it. The woman has no choice but to tell the child about Wald. He helped to find a way. At that time, Gordon’s adult had planned to enter the position of Qi Qi, and entrusted Werder Heights to Walter. You also know that our pressure on guarding the plane is very large, only the ability to barely maintain the situation, Wald fundamentally Can't leave the meteorite high ground, once he is gone, the whole The plane of the plane will collapse immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sharply grasped the key: "You mean, the reason behind Wald’s weird behavior, It was actually his child's illness. Someone was threatening him with his only son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris sighed and said, "This is just my guess. The practice of Wald's cultivation is very special and powerful, but at the same time the defects are also very obvious. The biggest flaw is that when Wald enters the sanctuary, he will lose the ability to have offspring, so this child will be The only son of Wald in this life, if there is something that can threaten him, then this child is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I arrived, the mysterious witch doctor had disappeared, and the child just started the last episode, right on me. In front of him, he became a monster on the spot, and then burned to death." Achilles's voice revealed a deep sorrow, Gordon's former thirteen knights went one more, and his children could not be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slightly surprised and asked: "Don't you can't suppress his lesions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Asiris smiled and shook his head, then recalled the scene at the time, and his face appeared to be vaguely stunned. He said: "When I saw the child, all the inside of his body had changed. It was just a human skin. The monster, the monster broke out in front of me, and then tried to **, I tried to suppress it, and I came into contact with a dark, deep, and vast force, the power is just like the sea, so vast that I can not shake Then, it burned into a black fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, Achilles’s voice has become a little short, and his chest is undulating. It was obvious that the situation had a big impact on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can make the Dark Theologer so rude, obviously the power is far beyond the legend of the general sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris calmed down a little and said: "However, I am not all without gains. Under my total pressure, the monster did not It was completely burned and it left this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Seminist took out a small steel box and carefully opened it and handed it to Richard. Inside the steel box is a broken claw tip. Most of them are burnt and burnt, leaving only the tip of the claw at the front. The claws are black and shiny, and the texture is extremely hard. The material is different from the claws of ordinary creatures. The claws are not the size of the fingers. Richard carefully picked them up and repeatedly watched them in their hands. However, there was a chill of ice in the bottom of my heart. I don’t know why, seeing this claw, his mother’s nest is always hidden in the belly. The lower limbs are sharp. At this moment, Asiris also said in a timely manner: "Adult, I always have a feeling, the feeling that I felt in the child at that time, It seems to be somewhat similar to your mother's nest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee categorically said: "The mother's nest has not left Faro, all its combat units are in my surveillance. Underneath, and it does not have this ability now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to this, Richard suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris smiled and said: "You understand, because your mother's nest does not have this ability, it is the real scary thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, unconsciously knocking on the table, his eyebrows locked, and he rarely seldom like this, Achilles is not ordinary Strong, he is not only strong, because of the professional relationship, but also the knowledgeable and versatile, in the knowledge of the legendary Master, Richard has understood the meaning of Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more powerful mother's nest, there is really no worse news than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are other clues." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stayed in the local area for a few more days, but I didn't find any valuable clues, so I rushed back. This time the enemy is more than I expected. It’s even stronger, it’s more cautious, and it’s not leaking.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes narrowed and said slowly: “This is really not good news, it seems We have to take some risks, we must speed up the pace of expansion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard, then now..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee categorically said: "Go back to Faro tomorrow, Achilles, you will go, this time will end with a war of God, you will be very important."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard always felt uneasy, so he simply rushed to the Eternal Dragon Hall and wanted to ask for the Vatican. Now it’s not too late, but time is for Vatican. It’s all meaningless, so when Richard heard that the Vatican’s great priest had quietly left, now the entire Eternal Dragon Hall is waiting for the next big priest, feeling Often surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Richard came, Nolan rushed in, this beautiful and intelligent grand priest has now fully stood on the side of Richard, while at the same time After Lin suddenly disappeared, Nolan was the strongest priest of the entire Eternal Dragon Hall, but she had no luxury for the position of the great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee, how are you..." Nolan greeted him halfway through, and suddenly stopped, she listened to what she was listening to, and after a moment she looked oddly. Richard glanced at him and said, "Follow me, there is something for Vatican's great priest to give you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
