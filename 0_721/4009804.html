			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people know that the battle that was just out of danger was just the beginning. The next war will be endless. In an unexplored plane, the invaders are the enemies of all aborigines. Therefore, after initially clarifying the current sinister situation, everyone is as busy as the magic crystal of the magic crystal, and is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand begins to be inspected everywhere in the forward base. The time lighthouse is a magical building, attached to the supreme power of the Eternal and Time Dragon, although it can be on the plane. Seeing the whole picture of the tower, in fact, it is partly in the gap between time and space, and the eternal time flame is there to guide the travellers on the shuttle plane. Now that the flame is extinguished, the magical array of the tower is still there, that is to say, it is still connected to the space-time gap. It is necessary to be careful where space cracks appear and tear or swallow the entire forward base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the scouring traces of time turbulence are scattered in every corner, and the power of disordered time is fatal to ordinary people. However, as a gods, quicksand can absorb the power of these times to supplement the mana cost, and even increase the mana ceiling slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was silently thinking that if she cleaned up the entire time of the base, she would jump to the nine-level gods. Although it is not possible to cast five levels of magic, the total amount of magic that can be cast will increase. This is also barely a blessing in disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Steps will pack up the scattered weapons of the sands, which are very useful materials. Some of the finest weapons are even better than they brought them. Because this time across the plane, they have a lot of legal personnel, Richard is also a builder, so with a lot of magic materials, consume a lot of energy, relatively less weapons and equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cleaned up while picking a place next to the base and burying the dead brothers. If you can still have a day in the future, you can bring the ashes of the same robes, otherwise the people buried today for the same burial will also sleep on the same day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy’s body needs to be buried or burned. It is also one of Noland’s knights’ rules, and should respect the dead enemy, let Warcraft It is a loss of honor to murder the body. The equipment, armor and belongings left behind by the enemy are spoils, and they need to be collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua and Gangde to explore the surrounding environment, and Oral wanted to go with the splash, I don’t know why I left it. This made Gangde look at him with great regret before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the elf poet stayed behind and there was nothing to do, and Richard immediately assigned him to interrogate the living prisoners to get more information. Because the high jazz is just an outpost, there is at least one baron behind him, what is behind the baron? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres ran outside the base and found a place to lie down and start to sleep. Natural and powerful vitality, so that eating and sleeping enough becomes a good means of recovery for the ogre. For example, it almost took two arrows of Oral's life, and it was a small injury that would only disappear in two or three days. They are not just sleeping, the two foodies raised by Druid have a keen sense of the natural environment. Once strangers approach, they will immediately be alert, even more effective than the stepping knight’s whistle. many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near dusk, the sand has been roughly checked the base, and fortunately, no time and space cracks have been found. As long as the power of clean time is cleaned, the base can be put into use again. The hoarding of food, weapons and steel arrows in the base solved the urgent needs of Richard. This is enough to arm up hundreds of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw that everything in the base was in order, he left alone, looking for an open space and preparing to test the seeds. The terrain here is slightly higher, not far from the forward base, and within the line of sight, once there is something, you can quickly summon help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment ‘seed’ is held in the hands of Richard, and the dark cyan eggshell is constantly shaking, as if there is a small life inside to break the shell. Richard feels that ‘seed’ is a special form of life, and the atmosphere of life is becoming more and more intense and active. It seems that the process of crossing the plane allows it to absorb more power. And the closer it is to your body, the stronger the pulse of life inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this not too big cyan eggshell, there are hidden terrorist weapons? Organic weapons? Does it mean some kind of Warcraft, or something else? Being able to let the Vatican priest reveal a little bit of information will cost a lot of gods, at least it should be much stronger than the lower dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue eggshell is like an indestructible fortress, and the life inside clearly begins to slash the eggshell, but there is no progress. And Richard holds the seed, but he doesn't know how to do it. He tried to send magic, but there was no reaction at all. But when he took a glimpse of his spirit into the seed and tried to perceive what was happening inside, suddenly the mental power, such as the flood of the flood, was madly poured into the seed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has almost a splitting headache, and even feels that his soul has been torn hard. Fortunately, his will is tough, and this is not faint. . However, the spiritual strength has been absorbed by the endless stream, and it is impossible to stop the flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware that if the spirit of being absorbed cannot be cut off, the final result will be to take away his soul and suck away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the suction is so great that no matter how hard he tries, he can’t stop the seed, and the pain from the soul makes all his nerves paralyzed, whole body You can't move, you can't even scream or drop the seeds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard’s mental strength is stronger than that of the same level, it is not endless. In the blink of an eye, it is sucked out by the seeds, and then the huge attraction is affected. His soul floated into the eggshell. At this time, the magical symbols in the sea of ​​consciousness of Richard suddenly burst into a strong light, which is the imprint of the soul contract and the magic slavery contract! The powerful contract force that erupted in an instant firmly grasped the soul of Richard's fluttering, and the attraction that came from the seed side suddenly hardened a fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a click, Richard felt that something seemed broken in the depths of consciousness, and his soul broke a small under the tear of two extreme powerful forces. The small fragments were immediately sucked in by the gravity of the seeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked a black, paralyzed nerves seemed to suddenly get vitality, and the whole person fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the water that was leaping between trees suddenly fell to the ground and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another direction, Gangde, who was running, suddenly hugged his head, and a painful sigh, consciousness became a disorder, not pointing Fitted into a big tree. With a click, the big tree, which is ten centimeters thick, was broken by Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogre outside the base woke up from the sweet dreams, and at the same time bounced and grabbed their heads and mourned. The elf poet who was interrogating to the crucial moment in the base spurted a blood and directly fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before the loss of consciousness, and Richard is awakened by the pain of acupuncture. He barely looked up and saw the seeds sticking to his cheeks, and he fell in front of his eyes. The crystal clear cyan in the clear vision was smooth and moist, and he could not see the pores of the general biological eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
