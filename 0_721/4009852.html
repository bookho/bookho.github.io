However, Richard’s next words gave him gas hope: “I can consider giving you a chance. The 12th grade teacher should be given enough respect. Before I make the final decision, you are my captive. I am. I hope to see that the Necromancer is also a member of the noble Master. But in this case, I will take a lot of risks, such as running away, or sneak attack..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Sandra can not care about the pain of the whole body, straight body, proudly said: "If measured by magic, I am no worse than any great magician! And my dignity and pride, even those who have been secular The great magicians who have been eroded by pleasure are even stronger! I can swear in the name of the undead king, and during the captivity, I will never make a loss of identity. But I want to ask, why do you want to capture me? Which kingdom do you dedicate to me? If so, please kill me now. I will not be willing to be nailed to the fire on the shelf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard rummaging through the memory of his mind Said faintly: "A 12-level undead mage, if given to a king or a god, should receive a lot of rewards or grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru was silent for a moment before he said, "This is true. If you give me to the king or the Grand Duke, then you can get at least one jazz title. If you sacrifice me to God, there will be no The vulgar gods, even the priests below the age of ten can advance directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, just wanted to say something, and the sand behind him suddenly said: For the Eternal and Time Dragon, the Necromancer is also a good sacrifice. Although there is no temple here, you can sacrifice and accumulate grace through the book of my time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence came out, Richard’s gaze to Sandru immediately changed a little, and the face of the Necromancer was obviously not likely to see where to go. The holy flame of the sand is extremely harmful to the undead, although her level is not high, but when Sander sees her, she still fears most of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going up and down to look at the Necromancer for several times, Richard shook his head and sighed and said, "I really have such a precious sacrifice. ...but you don't have to worry, I won't give you to God for a while, let alone a king. Our destination for this trip is the blood-stained land, where there are only robbers, slave traders and barbarians, no kings, no There is no grandfather. However, although the oath of the undead king witnesses your sincerity, it is not enough. You see, obviously our beliefs are completely different. You need to convince me further, why believe in you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru nodded and said, "Please wait a moment." After that, he went into the dilapidated building, and after a while he held a delicate box and handed it to Richard. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magic trick made by the devil's skull, which I prepared for myself. If I can reach level 16, I am ready to be near life. Turning yourself into a lich at the end is my life's fate. For a necromancer, it is priceless," Sandru explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and put away his bones, then said, "So welcome, Sandro, we have more teams going to the bloody land." A member!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sander packed up, Richard stood in front of his mother's nest and fed a piece of magic crystal to his mother's nest. This is the food that the mother's nest needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you stand close, you will really feel the hugeness and horror of the mother's nest, especially the outer shell of the black oil, when filled with the entire field of vision, always gives people a sense of oppression facing the black hole. Even with the connection of the soul, Richard felt that the visual impact of the hen's nest was a bit too strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of magic crystal was thrown by Richard, and the mother's nest was swallowed immediately. After swallowing twenty pieces of magic crystal, the mother's nest temporarily stopped eating, quietly squatting for a few minutes, the inside of the carcass suddenly sounded continuous hum, and then the will of the mother's nest once again connected with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I have accumulated enough energy to advance to the second-order mother's nest. Now you need to choose a new direction for strengthening my ability. Currently You can choose to strengthen myself, or you can choose to strengthen the combat unit. There are three options for strengthening my body, including speed enhancement, enhanced defense, and increased combat unit creation. In combat units, you can choose to add one to the fast beast. Additional reinforcement capabilities can also be developed by selecting one of two new combat units.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard’s awareness has increased a lot. data. These include two new combat units, one is a blood-sucking wing similar to a bat, a fast-moving World of Warcraft with a strong sense of perception that can be used for quick reconnaissance and alerting. Although their individual combat power is not strong, once they are formed in sufficient quantities, they are still terrible. Especially when the ability to evolve toxins is evolved in the future, the combat effectiveness is considerable. One egg in the mother's nest can hatch a fast beast, but it can hatch six blood-sucking wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second combat unit looks like a normal demon wolf, but the four paws are extraordinarily larger. Speed, complex ground passing ability and the ability to spit the wind blade are their characteristics. The special ability of the squirting blade is similar to the magical wind blade. The recovery cycle is similar to that of the human mage, and three can be ejected every day. In terms of comprehensive combat effectiveness, the wind can be roughly equal to the seven-level fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only if there is a sufficient number of wind teeth around the nest will not be entangled in the swamp. The range cutting of the wind blade is a good helper for the group battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated thoughts, Richard decided to let the mother's nest first enhance the speed of movement. Although the combat power of the hen's nest is strong, the slow moving speed has become a fatal injury. Next, Richard left the mother's nest with twenty magic crystals, giving it the ability to cultivate the wind. Now Richard's starting point for all considerations is survival. The appearance of the wind teeth looks no different from the devil wolf, and whether it is human, orc or barbarian, there is a tradition of domesticating the wolf. At that time, the team did not appear to be more alternative with more than a dozen heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard once again led the team on the journey, the mother's nest has completed the enhancement of the movement speed. Its chest carapace becomes openable, revealing a row of translucent organs that can reduce its weight by a third. The limbs that are too short compared to the body are all shed, and new, more powerful limbs are grown. After the evolution is completed, the mother's nest can move at a speed of ten kilometers per hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed is still slow, but it is already twice the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the second promotion, the will of the mother’s nest has become clearer and stronger, and it is once again linked to Richard, saying: “Master, if You see the statue of the ancestor worship or the altar, you can bring it to me, I really need the hidden power in it. If there is enough power, not only can speed up my progress, but also form my second consciousness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second consciousness?" Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
