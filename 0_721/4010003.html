			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrificial ceremony has come to an end, three pale gold Enter Kas, Marvin and Richard. Kas and Marvin are the tributaries of the sacrifice ceremony, contributing their own power to the communication of the eternal and timeless dragons, and therefore they have been diverted to a little grace. The two pastor levels of each of them have risen to the next level, and now they are all nine-level pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard, the spectator who was completely idle, actually got a little grace, and he couldn’t help but make the sands a little angry. Moreover, Richard’s time is still graceful, although the effect is less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God-Life Dew: Your body will not age in the next six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six months! Six months can do a lot of things. If there are thirty drops of dew..." Liu Sha is angry and can't help but start to convert God grace. Of course, she still looks calm and even a little solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Clark walked out of the room, the appearance had returned to middle-aged appearance, and the body skin was even more faintly revealing the pale gold luster. The enormous power of grace and the power of time have not yet fully absorbed, and it will take another few days to become ordinary people. He still wrapped his robes all the time and quietly left the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark is now back to the thirteenth level, and Norland’s standard can be awarded the title of God. There are many large-scale gains in the six-level magic. With Clark, the overall combat power of the Richards will increase by one level. Of course, with Clark, Richard also harvested an enemy as a great priest, and may even be an enemy of the entire god of the high gods. However, as an invader of the ectopic plane, Richard is naturally the natural enemy of the Faro gods, so it is no different to sin more crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark left at night, going to the camp of the Devil's Gun to bring his own troops, and see if he can hire the rest of the troops. The troops belonging to him have seventy elite cavalry and fifteen unbelievers. In the future, these untrusted pastors will turn into believers of the Eternal and Time Dragon. They don't have the problem of conversion of faith, so they can become formal priests, not fallen deities like Clark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accidental acquisition of God-given Richard, for this drop of life dew is not at all in mind. But if you equate it with one-thirtieth of a big devil, you know that this drop of dew is not so easy to obtain. With Richard's current strength, any big devil can shoot him flat. Moreover, the dewdrops were very easy to write, and Richard did nothing from beginning to end. He just watched the sacrifice ceremony and he got a little grace, which made the sands feel very unbalanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful little priest has the title of a oracle, but he is the first to host such a major sacrifice for the first time, and it is the first time that he has seen so many The chosen host sacrifices the gods. The treasures listed by the old dragon for a time dazzled their eyes and turned into an alternative small shopaholic. Her shopping list doesn't look like an end, so every drop of grace is so important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this shows that the eternal and time dragons attach importance to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of absorbing the grace of God is much shorter than the last time, and the rush of the power of time is also taken for granted. However, in the process of absorbing the force of time, there are countless light and color bands passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Richard only regarded this as a normal reaction to absorb God's grace, but this time somehow, I think of the book of time I have seen. He suddenly felt that there seemed to be something hidden in the light, so he took full advantage of wisdom and real talents, and raised the speed of the brain to the extreme, trying to capture the things behind the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same second-order wisdom and real talent, Richard's perception ability and scope have been enhanced to the point where it is not weaker than the sanctuary. After seeing the light, there is indeed a picture hidden behind it. Just the number of pictures is too much, and the flashing is too fast. The flashing frequency of nearly a thousand in one second is completely impossible for ordinary people to capture. Richard's heart madly jumped and tried his best to capture a few pictures, but all were vague and could only barely distinguish the outline of the characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he sorted out the residual images of memory and saw the moments of these pictures, Richard suddenly became cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ceremony, there are many finishing touches in the sand. When everything is finished, it is already falling at night. With tired sand, I came to the room of Richard and saw that Richard was standing in front of the big map and meditating on something, his face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat quietly behind Richard and did not speak. Both of them have their own minds, each immersed in their own world, the heart of the room can almost hear the sound of heartbeat, and time quietly passed in a quiet. When two people were awakened, it was already two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like he has made up his mind and puts a punch on the map! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand stood up and stood behind Richard, looking at the map and seeing Richard’s fist on the sign of a slave camp. It is a camp belonging to the Red Cossacks, not far from the Blue Water Oasis. It is an important transit point for the red Cossack slave trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is slightly frowning. Before the robbery of the red Cossack’s second-class caravan can be said to be revenge for this killing, then the raid of the slave camp is a real blow. In the red Cossack's soft underbelly, it is also the enlightenment that the other side can't ignore it. Afterwards, it will inevitably face a full-scale war with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the plane is composed of war and bones. The sand is not a naive girl. She also has the mind to completely remove the red Cossack, but the key to the problem. Not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, is this a little too anxious?" It is not wise to erect too many enemies at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, apparently he was struggling inside, and he was able to fight for some time, but the benefits and risks were not proportional. And they have the eternal and timeless dragon gods, time is always on their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sand sand, I saw some vague scenes when I absorbed the grace, what does this mean?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sands of sand, then serious, asks: "Is it clear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating, I said, "No, it’s very vague. I can only see what happens to happen, but I can’t tell the person who participated in the incident completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, this way." Flowing sand did not ask, but began to explain: "Because the eternity of the eternal and the dragon of time is condensed by the power of time, so in the process of absorbing the grace, your soul And perceptions occasionally go deep into the torrent of time, and then glimpse what might happen in some time in the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will happen in the future?!" The face changed greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sand is looking down at the map, not paying attention to Richard’s strangeness, nodding, saying: “Because the absorption of time is the power of time, it is possible to predict In the future, it is only possible to capture a future segment that can be distinguished, and at least it is possible to repair it. You don't have that ability now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
