After losing four strong men in succession, the team Daksodas finally chose to change the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Richard began a life of a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fights, rests, draws costumes, and sometimes chats with girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, Richard’s understanding of power is growing, and his blood is growing. After the world of magical trees, the world of trees One grows to the fourth order. In the process of the growth of the Moon World tree, Richard’s induction of the moon force is greatly enhanced, and the power of the Elf Sword is also improved accordingly, but in the Seven-Sword, it is still shattered and The ring of destiny is the most powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Moon World Tree grew to the fourth order, Richard got a new bloodline: Moonlight was full of Hua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability is also a talent for growth, which allows Richard to choose to absorb a certain type of force and store it in the Moon Tree world. When you can call the stored monthly force, the power of the related magical or secret sword will increase greatly. With the continuous improvement of the moonlight fullness level, new branches will grow on the tree of the world. Root branches have a color that corresponds to a certain monthly force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and decided to choose the monthly force of the fourth string of the blue moon as the first monthly force of Moonlight Man Hua, this aspect is Because in the secret sword of the elf, Richard has the deepest understanding of the destruction, on the other hand, in his heart is also a memorial to the mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After selecting the moonlight of Moonlight Manchuria, Richard suddenly had some doubts and began to think about a problem that was previously ignored by the subconscious. What kind of power is the monthly force, and why it can exist across the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what information you get from it, Luna Eleusia is obviously the god of Noland’s position, and it’s not that powerful, but Why does the monthly force she dominates have such incredible power, and the rules behind such power have at least the attributes that transcend the plane, then how can Eleusia be so weak, even powerful power is not considered . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only thought about it and buried his doubts in his heart. This is not the secret that he can crack now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing is always unknowingly. For Richard, life seems to be no different from the past, but the strongest people who are not in the future In fact, it is quite different from the past, and it is too big to ignore the point of avoidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day the blackbird was requisitioned, they never saw the construction of Richard, not to say that life is extinct, that is, any ordinary The structure has not been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard did not pull down any battle, and often went out to city safari, but should also be drawing the composition, because he is still a lot Purchasing magic materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can blame him, Richard still accepts requests for repairs, and does not even refuse to live from the Marshal Guard, whether it is completion time or Quality is blameless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point of view, Richard has fully fulfilled the obligations of a recruited constructor, and because he is stationed in the extant battlefield, he can see To the strong need to repair the structure, so the repair effect is often better than the return to the Norland native repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time in the contribution list of the capital of the day, Richard is still far ahead of most sanctuaries, only to see the number of killings, even enough to make some The members of the round table shut up, not to mention the general strong. If you want to blame Richard, you must kill more than he can, so that everyone can choose to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this day, there is still an unusual guest coming to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a woman, a woman who has no name, only the title. Her title is a broken dream. In the day when it is not falling, the broken dream is the only woman who is more famous than the white night. The famous way is the same. They are all the same horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the white night, the broken dream is a magician, and is a legendary mage, she is longer than illusion and spiritual magic, blood talent is even more than the top of the world food chain It’s still scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a visit to the door, and Richard has to pay attention to it. One reason is naturally her strength and identity. The legendary mage can visit, instead of inviting invitations. It is a kind of behavior that is very face-to-face. Another reason is that she is one of the three legends of the day and night. The only one who did not participate in the requisition of the day, she did not appear in the Chamber of Justice, but deep. Rehabilitate in your own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream wears a veil, the specially designed mage robes are a good example of her figure, this is a charming woman, but only this However, the broken dream did not make it look like a genius, although it was an easy thing for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house to sit, broken dreams took the veil, revealing a beautiful face, she is very beautiful, but beautiful without features, but if someone wants To study whether her face is beautiful or not, she will fall into a trap, and at any time she will focus on her, which is equivalent to the spiritual fantasy that she has created for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard certainly knows that the dream is terrible, but he also has strong confidence in himself, convinced that his will will not be shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream focused on Richard for a while, only sighed and said: "You have a very strong will, the soul is even stronger to even me I can't see the end. I have to say that you are the kind of opponent I hate the most. This time, Hastings and Rondestedt are probably doing something wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard faintly said, "Everyone has their own position and persistence. I understand them, but unfortunately, understanding does not mean agreeing. In this matter, I am in opposition to their position, and we There is no possibility of concession, but you will not be here for this event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is a faint smile, saying: "This is you." The conflict with them has nothing to do with me. I don't belong to the capital of the day. After I have resisted this difficult time, I will leave here and continue to explore the plane. Maybe one day is tired or boring. I will come back here again, but I don't know how many years later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very desirable," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you get to the legend, let's talk about it again. When you get there, you will find that your loved ones, friends, and children are getting old." Death, you see all the strange world, unfamiliar planes, strange life, and never-ending exploration and battle. Any rule of plane is enough for us to study the end of life, the world of legend, Destined to be alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigh of the broken dream made Richard very surprised. The legends he came across were not many, but most of them seemed to live very well, except These legends on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream laughed at himself and said, "Oh, I seem to be a bit stunned. It may be a recent continuous injury, and I am a little scared." This is becoming more and more words. Well, let's talk about business, Richard, I think you should understand my intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s for the sake of decoration.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream nodded and said: “The whole fortress needs your construction. If possible, even I need it. You see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the legendary wizard untied the placket and pulled it down, revealing the round shoulders and the top of the frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that this is a third-order structure that increases the power of magic. It is also rare, but it is a standard structure. It means that it does not completely meet the needs of broken dreams. The broken dreams that are known for illusion and spiritual magic need to enhance the penetrating power of the spell. However, any structure that increases the penetration of spells is non-standard, which means Only a few large builders can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, a legendary mage in Noland wants to get a non-standard third-order structure is not too difficult, but want to get a fit The non-standard third-order construction is not too easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, but did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream is no longer awkward, but straightforwardly said: "Lee, we support very hard, any help is necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you need to build it, why not use it? The structure that is loaded onto your body can also be classified into the property category," Li said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
