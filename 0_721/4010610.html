Don't give me a reply, I thought, you should choose the first one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wold sneered: "There are many strong people who are more than Gotton. Powerful, there are many aristocrats with more troops than Gordon, but they are not Gotton, never."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and agreed, saying: "I am not a father, nor will he be like him. However, my father and I are in a different environment, and the way of doing things is bound to be different. The path that my father is used to is not suitable for the present Akmend, so Just give me some time, I think my achievements will not be worse than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde smiled aloud and said: "Gordon Adults are not perfect. In fact, his shortcomings are obvious. We all know, but this is Gordon, who is the one we are willing to follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a deep breath and pressed the shadow of the man again in his heart. When Richard had a problem, he always thought about it. If it was Gordon, then what would he do, and now, with the act As the experience increased, Richard began to deliberately avoid thinking about Gordon. In particular, before some important decisions, he would consciously suppress the shadow of Gordon. Richard now only makes his own judgments according to his own judgment. And the most correct decision, as Richard just said, the environment is different, the method of solving the problem will be different, and the effect of the method will not necessarily be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard believes that after a while, he no longer has to deliberately imitate or evade the man, and by that time, he will truly mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Richard looked up and looked at the boxing fighter who was over a full half and asked: "You don't have to be my follower. It is also possible to continue to work for Archimonde like Achilles, and even become a lord within the family. This is a viable option. Even if you refuse to stay, I will try my best to compensate. The rewards I have paid for the family over the years, but why must I be enemies with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde grinned and said, "Why are there so many?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s voice turned flat and said: "You can’t take this plane. The Holy Alliance will not admit you. The soldiers here belong to Archimonde. They may not be willing to betray Archimonde. In one step, even if they are willing to follow you, you can succeed. Look at the military power behind me. These are enough to level your troops. If necessary, I can call several times more troops. You are going to let these soldiers behind you bury your ambitions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ambitious." Wald reveals a sinister smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the neat array of warriors and generals. As expected, many people were intertwined with despair and decisiveness, just look at Lee With the number of knights, you can know that this is definitely a defeated war, but they are not lacking the courage to fight a deadly battle, but more people are revealing doubts and confusion, because Richard’s troops are fighting Archimonde’s flag, although the badge has been changed to Richard’s own volcanic world tree, is still the symbol of Archimonde. From the dialogue between Wald and Richard, they are slow and know. The young man in front of him is the son of Gordon. He is currently the patriarch of Archimonde. These soldiers are wondering why they should fight the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if Wald really decided to go to war, these fighters might not follow the order. Walter shook his head and said, "This has nothing to do with ambition, but the reason is not important. Now I have a group of people who are willing to follow me." Warriors, no matter what decision I make, they will support me, so if you are desperate, you can still cause you a lot of trouble, but I don’t want them to die, so I have a proposal, you will fight with me. Yes, if I win, this plane will be handed over to me for 30 years. I will return it to you after 30 years. If I lose, then my troops will surrender, I hope you will not bother them, today. Before, many of them didn't know what was going to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li said indifferently: "But I don't see the need to fight with you, my As long as the Cavaliers attack, they can level your army. I am the patriarch of Archimonde first, then the commander of the army, and finally the strong fighter."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde smiled: "You won't refuse."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and nodded and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wald laughed, rubbing his hands, and the iron fists made a harsh rubbing sound. He turned and yelled at the soldiers who had already been there: "You look, this is the current owner of Archimonde. The son of Gordon, Richard, Richard Archimonde, I will fight with him. If I lose, you will let go of your arms and surrender. If I win, I will stay with me and I will not. Anyone who left behind can return to Archimonde with Richard, can you understand it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior and the generals are all over the face, at a loss, Wald did not explain, turned to Richard, put a hand posture and said: "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Achilles could not help He said: "Walde, what are you doing, you are doing this, and you are waiting for us to be enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axis in us It refers to Senma, Han Erdong, who are still alive among these thirteen knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what I am doing." The boxing fighter put a big hand on Achilles and made a secret gesture. This is the thirteen knight. A popular gesture between them means "give me." Whenever this gesture is made, it means asking the companions all the trust, even in this case, but seeing this gesture, Achilles suddenly felt that she didn't know what to say. Although he still felt uneasy in his heart, Achilles and Han Erdong just touched the bottom line, but did not do any real betrayal, but Wald is now doing it. What you have done is already a formal betrayal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betrayal, one of the worst practices in the Noland tradition, Wald even managed to support his own forces behind the scenes, but also successfully held the meteorite highlands, but His reputation in the aristocratic world has also been ruined, and the most crucial thing is that he is one of the thirteen knights. No matter how unruly he is, he can not play for Richard, but he should not betray the heirs of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard slightly frowned, and Wald put on the moment of the posture, and the momentum rose to the sky, so that Richard had the feeling of facing the ancient beast. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde’s strength is by no means the strongest person Richard has ever faced, but the pressure he brings to Richard is even worse than the illusion of the beginning. There are very few, Richard is very rich in enemy experience, and immediately know that Wald belongs to the kind of mad warrior who is extremely powerful and can pour out more than half of the temper in a short time. This kind of enemy may not be the most powerful. However, it is definitely the most dangerous. Even if you face opponents whose strength is stronger than your own, relying on the powerful explosive power of the moment, they may also win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wald did not retreat, and the distance between Richard and Licha opened 30 meters, and this stopped. The boxing fighter knew that Richard was a mage, so he first opened the distance to show fairness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the distance is far away, Richard feels the pressure is even greater, and the intuition perceives the fatal danger. He is constantly screaming in consciousness and repeatedly reminds Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was murdered and immediately pulled out the moonlight, but it was not enough, and he threw the fate of the twins, the sacred killing and the extinction. Minimizing the burden, then holding the moonlight in both hands, staring at Wald, the huge pressure almost let Richard first attack, but he finally endured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wald’s eyes were amazed and appreciated. He didn’t expect his murderousness and pressure to be picked up by Richard, and he’s quiet and looks very Easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, kid, I will remind you at the end, fight with me, it is best to make the best effort from the beginning, otherwise you will regret it." Wald said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome cheek of Richard’s cheeks trembled violently, the hand holding the knife was too violent and the knuckles were whitish, without the reminder of Wald, Richard also Do not dare to keep a hand, in the face of such an opponent, if there is a slight reservation, it is undoubtedly to find death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a big step in a few steps, stepping on the ground, and making a dull and violent step, making the whole earth tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Walter started, Richard immediately stood up and hurriedly read the spell, and the huge magic instantly swayed in all directions, everyone There is a strange feeling, watching Richard's figure has an unreal meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time stopped, Richard grabbed the magic in the first time, and then in the short magic effective time, Richard continued to make six Instant and two magic spells that require a short spell. Four of the eight magics are fortifying themselves. They are fast, fast-moving, action-free, and can be greatly enhanced by the power of fire magic. Magic, including sluggishness, cursing, lignification, and weakness, was thrown on Wald, and then using the last time that time stopped, Richard also activated the hot blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
