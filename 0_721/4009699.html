For the first time, Li has shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experimental field, the physical strength of the armored horse is rapidly consumed, and its speed is obviously slowed down, but it is still much faster than the average armored horse, the physical exhaustion Of course it is also faster. After knocking down the last obstacle, it was finally exhausted, screaming, and fell to the ground, spewing a large group of white foam, and the four hooves twitched a few times, and then no longer move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei screamed, did not expect this result, hurriedly looked at Phil Master. The old magician patted him and said, "Don't be nervous. Ordinary junior agility will only increase the speed by about 30%, and the magic pattern you made is not perfect, but the speed is 30% to 5. The swaying of the armored horse is not enough to carry the magic pattern, just for the experiment, it is forced to insert the magic pattern. If everything is complete, the magic pattern will not be like this. Damage the ontology. Now, I think you should have seen how the builder changed the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, his heart still Jumping wildly, I can’t speak at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the power that can change the world, be careful, especially you." Phil Master said with a meaningful meaning, he left with Richard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Richard is allowed to rest, and he must have a rest. The drawing of ‘primary agility’ kept him in a state of extreme excitement all night, and his physical strength, energy and magic had already been overdrawn. At this moment, he saw the effect of his own hand-made magic pattern, but he could not restrain himself. However, after the mood was relaxed, Richard felt the same degree of fatigue, and the eyelids were like a heavy stone. They couldn't open it. They wanted to sleep on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil called a duty mages and told him to bring two aliens to send him back to his residential area. After the equivalent class mage left, Phil thought about it and called a student next to him. He handed him a purchase receipt, and asked him to send a powerful box of magical healing agents and energy recovery agents to Richard. The account is recorded on his own head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This student is already 30 years old and has been following the master for many years, so his face is only slightly surprised. In fact, the bottom of his heart is constantly turbulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only ten bottles in each of the two boxes of pharmacy. However, the potency of the strong pharmacy produced by Dark Blue is several times that of the same kind of agent outside, and the price is more than ten times. Although Phil has a very high position in the dark blue, his income is also matched with his status. However, these two boxes of pharmacy are equivalent to the fixed income of the master for the whole month. You know, Phil's income is not only used to maintain his own food and clothing, the operation and maintenance of his laboratory, and the compensation for the people he works for are all from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other young students next to them are even more concealed. Surprised, there are some, there are also indifferent, but very few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment of the magic pattern took up the entire morning time, Phil looked at the timing magic hourglass, and the afternoon magic philosophy class was about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the magical transmission array in the northeast corner of the stands flashed a few times, and the figures of Stevenson and Minnie appeared. Far away to see Phil, Stevenson immediately called out: "Master Phil, finally found you!" He has always been gentle, showing the eagerness and joy that can not be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
