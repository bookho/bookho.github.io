			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old name is Cha Talay, the current Dagong Sabalu Zeng Zengzu, who has lived for hundreds of years, is the strongest of the same era as the Three Kings of the Empire, but unlike the empire of the three imperial empire, Cha Talai is suspicious and weak, and the strength of the legendary strong in the same era is the bottom. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, in the war between the legend and the gods, Chatterley fled the battlefield with legendary ability, and this survived until the end of the war, and the covenant of the gods signed. He dared to reappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the gods of the Faro occupied the upper hand, and the three kings of the empire were exiled outside the plane, while Chatterley was in a low-key retreat. It is a legendary strongman who supported the family behind the scenes to establish the Principality of the Pearl Chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really made Chatterley’s mind come alive, but it was a chance opportunity a hundred years ago that he discovered a natural passage to the ectopic face, that is A dragon dominates the plane, which is the source of the dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, through continuous efforts and continuous resource investment, the Principality of the Pearl Chain has finally stabilized the channel of the plane, allowing the Dragons to continue to enter Faro. The plane, which made Sabaru’s ambitions swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden rise of Richard’s Crimson Principal has made Sabalu unexpected, but he has never met the young Grand Duke on the frontal battlefield, still not I put Licha in the eye, so I had the mind of the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether Chatter or Sabaru did not think that Richard, who is not a legendary mage, actually dared to come alone and strangled Sabalu in one fell swoop. All the elite warriors and dragons killed Sabaru and beat Chadley with almost no effort to regain it. It turns out that Richard is still overestimating the power of Cha Talai and killing him. Chatterley did not even have time to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main plane, Noland, the sacred sect is also a figure standing on the top of the plane. Even though Richard has no legendary magic, but a combat power Has been tyrannical beyond the understanding of Chatterley and Subaru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Richard, no matter everything is gray suit, artifact moonlight, artifact abomination, even if placed in Noland is the treasure that the legendary strongmen are striving for If you have any of them, you can boast about it for a while. In fact, even if you turn everything into a gray suit, the king of metal will not say it, and the life and the magical armed forces are not to cause war. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the luxury of Richard’s equipment at this moment has already surpassed the category of upstarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chalay’s life in the second half of his life was in Reho, although the skill of using strength has been improving, but Richard knows through his battle today, his real battle The force is falling, and the real strong are tempered in the blood and fire, how could it be produced in such a gentle town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is also a legendary strongman, a figure who once stood at the peak of Faro, but finally ended up in such a way that Richard could not help but sigh. By seclusion and self-enclosure, it can only be exchanged for a moment of comfort, and sooner or later it will be hit by a foreign enemy like a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an era, hiding is useless, but only dare to face up, there is life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norland has long been accustomed to iron in the ongoing plane war, and generations of generations have been honing and growing on the battlefield. The overall strength of the company has also steadily increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to turn back. At the end of the diary, Cha Talay began to worry about his life towards the end. He has been working hard to find a way to live forever. I even thought about the road to sealing the gods. Unfortunately, for many years, seclusion has already allowed him to lose strength and courage. The closed plane system of Faro also made the gods full of sorrow, and there was a vacant priest to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Chatterley, who had nothing to do, actually thought of the road to the Lich, but he was reluctant to do so, so he continued to experiment and he turned to explore the magic field. Because of his legendary ability, multiple illusions are spell-like, so over time, research in this field has made some progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Chatterley successfully split a part of the soul, made a life, and tried to try a half lich road, which is also his initial battle disadvantage, but not Ken was immediately removed from the mountain because his life was hidden here. Once his life fell into the hands of Richard, the soulless Chatan will not live long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, when Chatterley was shocked to have a murder, it was too late to escape. Because of his life, his soul became extremely fragile. The result was smothered by a blue fire that attacked the soul. At the end of the diary, Chatterley mentioned the idea of ​​using the Dragons to split the Iron Triangle Empire. He wanted to recast a magical body and needed a lot of resources. These resources can only be collected by plundering the empire, and the success rate of magic knowledge that he later became a half-way is relatively low, and the problem of soul transfer has been difficult to solve. These require an authentic magician to assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly girls who Richard killed outside were the templating pieces of Chatterley's attempted magical body. By the way, he was also free to play and play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got here, the diary came to an end, and Richard also got a general understanding of the life of Chatterley, and in the diary, Richard also found what he needed. , the plane channel coordinates of the connected dragon face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard found a huge underground part under the main building. This is the lab and warehouse of Chatterley. Richard found it here. A large amount of enchanting equipment and magical precious materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the equipment is mostly quasi-legendary, only a few legendary equipment attributes are not so good, only can be regarded as entry-level equipment, compared to The gray dagger that was destroyed by Chattelley is the best equipment, and Sabalin’s quality of the cut short sword is also on these collections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha can only helplessly smile, the king of metal cooperates with the moonlight of the elf artifact, it is really powerful, but the side effects are also obvious, that is, after World War I, Richard Don't want to harvest any equipment anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although Richard himself does not see these collections of Chatterley, it is good to leave it to followers who may join in the future. The harvest is a large amount of magic materials and rare ore piled up in the warehouse. These things are common to all planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a top-ranking hero of Faro, and with the Great Principality of the Pearl Chain as a support, the collection of Cha Tae Lai’s centuries is still a small matter, just to count these materials. It took an hour of Richard's time to check it out. The total value of all the materials was around 10 million gold coins. Richard was equivalent to harvesting a top-level offering. It was thought that Chatterley was just a legendary sub-plane. It is not easy to get a top sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire courtyard was searched again, and Richard repaired the magical array with damage, and made a small change, then restarted it. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha rises from the peak, recruits the brain, discerns the direction, and flies to the north, from here to the north Up to a hundred kilometers, there is a valley that is not marked on the map of the existing empire and the Principality. The passage connecting the dragon's plane is in that valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard felt the speed and the cold chill outside the north ground, but the volcanic blood in his chest was eager to move, as if he had returned to the days of hunting in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After adding the king of metal, the everything has become a fourth-order suit, and the fourth-order suit is even rarer than many fifth-order constructs. Killing Cha Tae Lai, even if it was only the legend of Faro, let Licha’s understanding of power go further. At present, Richard is full of war and is not willing to stay in the same place to wait for followers. For him, leave the village. It seems that I have been chasing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain splits all the way, reaching Chadley’s valley coordinates in the diary in less than an hour, and Richard hovered over a mountain on the side , overlooking the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley is built with a large number of buildings. It is already a large-scale town. There are people coming in and out. Richard looks at at least hundreds of people. Dragons, and the entire town can accommodate 10,000 dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Dragons have become a climate, ready to enter Faro, and it’s no wonder that Sabah is so confident that he wants to separate the triangle from Richard. empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was no defensive magic array in the valley. Richard swept back and forth several times with real vision and found no alarm device. This is a dragon. They are too confident in the hiddenness of the valley, or they are so powerful that they are not afraid of the exploration of outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for whatever reason, Richard did not intend to change the original plan of action. He looked down at the valley and found the location of the plane portal in a moment, immediately Dive down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of landing, Richard launched the latest ability from Chatelai, and his body shape was hidden, just like disappearing into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal to the dragon's plane is obviously a solidified passage, a huge stone gate stands on a circular open space, and the center of the stone is flashing with deep blue The light curtain stood on the sides of the gate with several semi-dragon guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechao ran through the guards and stepped into the portal. He had just learned to use the power of Charlie, if these half-man had the power of the sanctuary, It is difficult to be undetected, but the strength of these guards is mostly around 11th and 2nd. Even if Richard has a 9th-level Thunder defender before entering the portal, they have not felt the abnormal fluctuation of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
