			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to Faro with you," Mex said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy! You should know what kind of existence I have in Faro's enemies. Your ability to fight the Reaper is almost equal to death!" Richard shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex is the daughter of the Prince of Tumen and the highest blood talent in the family. If she died in Faro, it would be a big problem. Richard is crazy again, and he doesn't want to offend the three empires at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex said faintly: "I am not crazy. If you want information on the dark side of the world, then do what I said. Wait for my mood. When you are good, you will naturally tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her deeply and said: "The dark side of the world is very very much to me. Important, but I am still guilty of Prince Tumen. If you insist on coming to Faro to die, I will not stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for? Let's go!" Mex stood up to Richard by unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha no longer delayed, bringing everyone into the portal of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of the portal, Richard immediately ordered the messenger to stand by. He wanted to go to the northern Xinjiang and personally play with the reaper to see how their strength is. . However, at this time, the brain broke an urgent message to Richard: the troops of Gangde were besieged by the reapers, and now they have been fighting for more than an hour. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard suddenly sinks down, in terms of time, now it’s too late to catch up. He strode into the war room, sat down, and waited for the latest military situation ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the magic map, a small spot is quickly approaching the battlefield. That is the strong faction that Richard sent to meet with Gangde. Seeing this, Richard’s heart relaxed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northern snowfield, an unusually fierce bloody battle is underway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is arrogant and struggling to throw the last throwing spear! The spear throws the flames up and slams into the belly of a small fighter. The throwing spear on the vindictive violently erupted, and the enormous power of the moment directly tore the fighter into two halves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde took a breath and looked into the sky. There were dozens of small fighters hovering in the sights. The miniature fighters were dense, at least hundreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beams in the sky are constantly falling like rain, knocking down one soldier. But the soldiers did not care about the threat at the top because the crisis from the ground was even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, there is a strange combination of mechanical and flesh-and-blood creatures. They are only one and a half meters high, with anti-joint legs similar to demons, and four arms on the upper body, two of them holding knives, and the other two ends are barrels that can shoot out the beam of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new reaper warriors have a metal skeleton, but at the same time have flesh and blood, eventually forming a new creature of flesh and metal mixed. They are extremely fast and endless. When the double-knife is down, it is the ten-level elite warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the snowfield, the number of this new reaper soldier has exceeded 10,000! And in the distance, there is a huge spaceship flying around, and then drop hundreds of flesh-and-blood warriors from the cabin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reaper’s reinforcements rolled in, but the Gangd’s troops did not have any support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army led by Gangde is a well-deserved elite in the deep red kingdom. But now, the war has been more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s giant axe waved the three flesh-and-blood warriors in two sections, then stepped on the big feet and flattened their heads one by one. I was relieved and looked around. Suddenly, Gangde’s line of sight solidified in the corner of the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the bodies of hundreds of Northern Army soldiers were dragged together, and the mechanical beetles that did not know where they came from were all the armor of these soldiers. Peel off, and then skillfully cut the body, compress the flesh and blood, and then seal a film on the surface to make a square flesh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanical beetles are extremely efficient, such as flowing water, neatly stacked in the cargo space of the spacecraft, and then come back to continue to make the flesh. The warriors who have been dealt with by them will only leave a pool of blood in their place, and even half of the bones will not be paid by lang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh-and-blood warriors dragged the bodies of more dead soldiers for mechanical beetle processing. The battle is still going on, and these reapers have started mass killings on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flesh-and-blood warriors dragged a thick and huge body to the disposal site. When they passed the sight of Gangde, the bald head of the body immediately stabbed the eyes of Gangde! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his most powerful general and his best brother! Now, when he fights to death, he can not get the glory of the Warriors. Instead, he must be cut and crushed and transported back to be used as raw materials. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes suddenly reddened and screamed: “*** ancestors!” Then they rushed to the brother who was being towed to the abattoir! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper has an extremely strict command system, and the flesh-and-blood warriors around immediately abandoned the original target and rushed up to Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde does not evade, screams, the tomahawk mad rounds, and suddenly rounded up dozens of flesh-and-blood warriors into two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more flesh-and-blood warriors are surrounded, and the outer flesh-and-blood warriors are constantly shooting with beams. Fortunately, the legendary armor of Gangde reflects most of the attacks, but its luster is also rapidly dimmed. Gangde is like a lion in a wolf group. Every step forward, it becomes more and more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the voice of Richard suddenly sounded in Gangde’s consciousness: "Gangde! Immediately break out! Run to the south!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breakthrough? At this moment, there are only abattoirs in Gangde’s eyes, and there are only a hundred and thousands of soldiers who will be cut and processed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is used to killing and dying, and the life that dies under his hand is said to be thousands of people. However, Gangde absolutely cannot tolerate such death. It is absolutely impossible to watch his own soldiers to be treated and processed like pigs and pigs after death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the first time that Gangde has violated Richard’s order. At this moment, his eyes are red, his voice is thunderous, the battle axe is waving like a wind, and the flesh-and-blood warriors are cut down, and then their wreckage is crushed with their own big feet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, the legendary armor of Gangde began to disintegrate, a flesh-and-blood warrior with a carapace was thrown down, and then several beams of light were tangled in Gangde. There are a few scorch marks on the back muscles, and the flesh-and-blood warrior pierces the blade into the body of Gangde, and tries his best to move the blade little by little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde screamed, and the backhand grabbed the flesh-and-blood warrior on his back and cut it with an axe handle. He suddenly smashed his head and then threw it aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s voice rang again. This time it was a lot harsher: “Gund! Immediately heading south, I will let people cover you! Obey Command, Gangde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is not only harsh, but also the power of the magic contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very old contract. Since its inception, Richard has never used the constraints in the contract, so that Gangde has forgotten The contract is such a thing. Now, when I heard the voice of Richard, Gangde’s headache was splitting, and he could not help but want to act according to the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this bald man looked at the abattoir not far away, his eyes became red again, arrogantly said: "Head! Let me do it." The things that the bitch raises are retracted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, Gangde rushed to the abattoir, but hundreds of flesh-and-blood warriors flocked to it. Just put Gangde underneath! The severe headache was replaced by the pain of the body in the blink of an eye. Gangde made a beast-like roar, and suddenly stood up, and his body was full of anger, and all the flesh-and-blood warriors on his body were blown up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary armor has been completely destroyed, and it has been torn apart in this complete outbreak of vindictiveness. The slewing armor has killed a large number of flesh-and-blood warriors. However, the number of flesh-and-blood warriors who are coming up is increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde violently gasped and looked around, only to find that there was only one left in the entire battlefield. Twenty of the knights, the generals, and the knights and the humanoid knights have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde took a deep breath and strode to the abattoir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in front of him, there are thousands of reaper warriors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Army is finished, and Gangde is also planning to go with the brothers who have followed him for more than a decade. Anyway, his reaping reaper warrior is enough, not too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two dark shadows suddenly passed through the sky, and then the dazzling lightning flashed the sky! A small fighter jet burned and fell, and several small fighters began to emit blue smoke and quickly got out of the area covered by lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
