			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Qi Qi’s training is still insufficient, the magic level is not enough, but there is magic With the help of the pen, she can already help Richard to complete some simple parts of the wild suit series. Although her success rate can not be compared with Richard, but can be equal to the average builder, and higher than the apprentice apprentice. Don't underestimate her role. With her help, Richard can shorten the time of drawing a set. In the face of time, a slight increase in the loss of basic materials is absolutely acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Qi Qi’s focus on drawing the composition is so moving, but now it looks very different, just because there is still one person in the magic lab, sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oracle is sitting by the window and is turning over the book of time that she will never finish. The sand-sitting posture is clever, showing the moderate but straight chest line and long straight legs. The untiring sands have already kicked off the shoes and socks, and a pair of bare feet glowed softly in the soft light of the window, making people want to bite a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flow of sand for comparison, Qi Qi’s posture also showed a problem. She leaned forward and leaned over the bench, but her legs were straight and she showed the amazing length and back-hip curve of her legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard pushed in, both girls adjusted their posture slightly to better show their advantage and fight against their opponents. Obviously, none of them are as focused on the surface as they seem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible pressure in the air, coupled with the thick moisture, made Richard suddenly feel that he had some difficulty breathing. He immediately felt that there were still many important things to deal with outside, and it was a retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" The sand has been screamed sweetly, and the sound is sweet and murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard went to the sand with a hard scalp and asked, "Sand sand, how come you? Your body has not completely recovered yet?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will see how you usually make the structure! Now I saw it and found it to be a complicated and tiring job." The word bites a particularly special weight, staring at Richard can only smile, then smile, continue to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the sands are surprisingly easy to talk, just snoring, and muttering: "I knew this, I really shouldn’t put a mirror of time. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately thought of a battle with the Son of the Forest, and the mirror of the right time saved his life. And in order to succeed in bridging the son of the forest above the level, she almost paid the price. So Richard was soft in his heart, reaching out and holding the flowing sand into his arms and slamming her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand is moving comfortably, and when you think about it, you become satisfied. "Well, have you seen Lina?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao snorted, his face was worried, said: "But I don't know what kind of reaction she will wake up when she wakes up. I am afraid she will be calm."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is true! Lina's heart should be very weak. Only wait for her to wake up, see the situation and say it." Flowing sand is also a headache. This oracle is superb and eccentric, but sometimes it is lacking in delicateness. In particular, she has nothing to do with the word weakness except for her appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qi Qi, Nyris asked me to ask you, is there any way?" said Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Qi heard that Richard called himself, he looked up and said faintly: "There is a simple way. As long as someone goes to pursue Lina, let her I feel that my charm has not declined, so I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pursuit?" Liu Sha and Richard looked at each other. Richard began to search for the right target in the bottom of his heart. The sand was not surprising. Although she thought about it, she had to admit that this method was really useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the Dragon Master is a big magician and has the ability to summon Red Dragon Caro. The strength is far above the ordinary big magician. In addition, in addition to the three Richards in the entire city, Pamir is barely able to get a little pursued. But this old man is obviously not the right candidate. Nyris and Agamemnon seem to be a little older than Lina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that only when I return to Noland, I will still face the same problem. Gordon's thirteen knights, although not the top of the imperial powerhouses, are also famous and famous, and then remove the family, position, etc., the scope of choice is exceptionally narrow. Otherwise, Master Long will not remain free and easy in the past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi looked at the frowning Richard and added: “It’s not necessarily a pursuit. In fact, seduce has the same effect. Whether it’s pursuit or seduce, right The role of a woman's confidence depends only on the identity and strength of the other person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is suddenly clear: "Good! Nyris and Agamemnon It seems to be all right! It seems that only they sacrificed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is too deep, sometimes it will have a negative effect. For example, when Richard talked about this kind of thing, there was no psychological burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Qi Qi shook his head and said: "They may not be suitable, in fact, the most effective," she paused, carefully put away the magic pen, Then put another finished intermediate in the side, straight up, looking at Richard, said in a self-explanatory manner, "It's you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I?" Richard's face suddenly became very weird. The face of the sand is more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard that Lina has always had extraordinary feelings towards the Marquis of Gordon, but it seems that she has never received a response. And you and the Gotton have a lot of Similarities, especially the volcanic temperament of the Archimonde family, is almost exactly the same as Gordon's. So if it is you, the effect will be better. As far as I can observe, Lina looks at your eyes, sometimes like Look at the Gotton adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone-breaking effect, so that Richard’s face is red and white, and he can’t even say anything. The sand is beginning to pervade the murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi did not look at the sand, but faintly said to Richard: "You just want to let Lina restore confidence, and not necessarily seduce. Occasionally It’s just as good to adjust the play of Lina. In fact, it’s nothing, depending on what kind of Lina adult you want to see in the future, no matter whether it’s sunshine or rain, it’s not the performance of Lina’s personality. Out of the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is really pushing Richard into a dilemma. Richard grabbed his head arbitrarily and said, "Or let Nyris go! Anyway, he is idle while he is idle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi was only a light smile, and there was no comment on the idea that Li intended to push his comrades down the fire pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of sand snorted and said: "In case the seduce succeeded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nothing is bad, Lina is very outstanding, and there are always ways to restore her appearance. In normal times, maybe a mask can be created." Qi Qi said that the clouds are light and light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The sand is very crazy, does that mean that there is one more person in the bed? How big can a bed be to accommodate so many people? However, this is not a good export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha saw the flash of light in the depths of Qi Qi’s eyes, suddenly understood, so his face sank and sneered: "You don't mind adding another person." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 流流反讥道: "How do you add? Do you come together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also! I am not qualified to ask for or oppose anything, so I will accept everything. But..." Qi looked at the sand, and suddenly revealed a shallow beautiful smile, saying: "If it is with the quicksand, I am looking forward to it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the sand lost . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the situation was not good and he hurriedly stopped them from talking. Then let Qi Qi continue to draw the structure, and then she pulled the sand and left the magic lab for a moment, and quickly sent her back. Let the two women get together, the time is a little longer, it must be a disaster, and it is the disaster of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, Liusha suddenly asked: "What about Li Fa, if we come together, do you have any opinions?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinions? How can Richard have opinions, just like Qi Qi said, he still has expectations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this sentence is not willing to say anything anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the deepest part of Richard’s heart, a small demon is quietly popping out of the corner, providing a hidden idea: if you let go of Qi Qi If you order something, maybe there will be surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Master Long finally woke up, a low-pitched exclamation in her room, and then quietly, she asked the maid to look for A covered helmet used by a warrior, and then locked himself in the room, no one can see. Everyone who heard the news and came to see him was turned away. In the evening, Master Long finally got out of the room, and her face had an expressionless cold mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a big battle, the situation in the Greenson plane was calm again, and the Green Sen Elf disappeared completely and never appeared around the city. After the violent violent battles, it was determined that most of the two life trees were moved away, and Richard was not willing to go deep into the area covered by the forest. After this battle, the inexplicable irritability that Niris had before disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current work in the base city is not only cutting trees, but also cutting trees. The open space outside the city is gradually expanding. For the first time in many years, the growth rate of the first forest has finally been unable to counter the pace of human advancement. The various timbers that have been felled are piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has already started building a wood processing plant outside the city, and it is built in five. After the initial processing, all kinds of ordinary wood will become at least easier to transport and have higher value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
