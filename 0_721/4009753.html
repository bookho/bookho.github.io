			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there something?" Gordon’s voice suddenly sounded, contemplating Richard was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Richard immediately recovered his calmness and shook his head to deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon did not continue to delve into it, but took two steps and randomly found a tombstone to sit on it, and did not see any strong ancestors of Archimonde. Respect for the person. And this action also surprised Richard. With the knowledge he has learned, the nobles of the Noland continent are very respectful to their ancestors. In many races, even esoteric spells can preserve the souls of some ancestors, thus inheriting knowledge and even spreading powerful powers. Therefore, in addition to the gods represented by the Eternal Dragon Temple, ancestor worship is also a very important branch of faith on the mainland. Among the Caledonian continents dominated by barbarians and many aquariums in the vast seas, ancestral worship is beyond the gods and is the first source of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think it's incredible?" Gordon smiled and looked at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the heart is always stuck with a stabbing thorn, Richard has to admit that Gordon’s current behavior seems to be very much to him. And Gordon’s smile is indeed fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Archimonde only looks at the reality. If you want to express your respect for the ancestors, then the best way is to awaken the blood and leave the blood. Inheritance, this is stronger than any meaningless ritual. Respect is the hooligans in our blood and soul! Well, boy, let me see what you have learned in the past few years, magic and decoration Needless to say, I don't know much about that stuff. But if you look at your bodywork, you should also learn some combat skills, just take this out and see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon embraced his arms and sat freely, his eyes continually sweeping through Richard, and each sweeping gave Richard a feeling of being thoroughly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Ning settled his mind, took out a dull dagger and began to show the dark world skills learned from Naia. The most famous disaster curse of the disaster blade is actually the ability of blood, and Richard can't learn. It is that he can learn from him and will not include it in the calendar. After all, Richard’s main occupation is still a builder and a magician. The result of distraction can only be that each one learns and is not refined, only through the fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of combat skills is not complicated, the difficulty lies in precision. In the same year, the slasher shot, you can easily cut a piece of hair into three pieces with a short knife in your hand, and the knife can be called the dark world. Only the strength of the ontology is not strong enough to restrict Naa's overall combat effectiveness, but the subtle combat skills allow him to challenge. Before disappearing from the dark world, only the 16th-level disaster blade repeatedly relied on the talented curse and combat skills to successfully assassinate the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead’s digital vision can maximize the power of this set of combat techniques. For example, if a dagger is punctured, Richard can immediately know whether the blade is five millimeters high or two millimeters lower. Of course, he is not a warrior himself. There is a limit to his ability to control the body, and the battle and drawing of the magic lines are never the same. When drawing the magic pattern, you can choose the most suitable environment, and there are a lot of tools to assist, so Richard can control the accuracy within 0.2 mm. When the accuracy exceeds 0.1 mm, it means breaking through the most important bottleneck of the big builder. The next step is mastery of magic, understanding and creation of the composition, and the acquisition of rare materials, all of which take time to achieve. However, in the battle, Richard needs to play very well in order to control the accuracy of the shot in the vicinity of a millimeter, and when he uses the blood pulse burst, the accuracy of the shot will plummet as the power surges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
