			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of people gradually drifted away, behind the body of the dead and died The horses were not buried and were thrown directly outside the abandoned camp. This is the tradition of blood-staining land. When people leave, vultures, hyenas and squirrels will turn all the bodies into a pile of white bones. Only then can the soul of the deceased be able to get rid of the curse that hangs over the land. Go to the country of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind teeth are not keeping up, they also need food, and the dead horses are enough to eat. Unlike the scavenging creatures in the blood-stained land, the wind teeth don't even stay with the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For combat units such as wind teeth, Richard is now bound to move human corpses without sufficient food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dusk, the Bloodstone Camp is already far away. This is an open space surrounded by pinnacles. A simple wall is built between the peaks. A large stone pillar and pinnacle are natural barriers. The lookout towers built on top of them have a wide view, and the range of the advanced archers can cover the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bloodstone camp was seen, the information about the camp once again flowed through Richard’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloodstone Camp is located near the edge of the blood-stained land, not far from the Sequoia Kingdom and the Grand Duchy of Blackwater, and belongs to the adventurer and caravan after leaving the human kingdom. One of the important strongholds. The resident population of the bloodstone camp has about 2,000 people, and the peak time of the caravans can reach 5,000. This is also the limit that the eight underground springs of the Bloodstone Camp can afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the eight springs in the entire Bloodstone Camp, four were controlled in the hands of a half-orc tribe named Bloodstone. The remaining four springs are controlled by four relatively small forces, one of which is the Blood Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloodstone Tribe Chieftain Thunder Hammer is also the most powerful controller of the Bloodstone Camp. The 14th-level Thunder Hammer, whether it is its own combat power or hundreds of powerful half-orc warriors in the tribe, has an absolute advantage in the entire bloodstone camp. Even in the human kingdom, the Thunderbolt can at least get a jazz status, not to mention the small site of the Bloodstone Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood Mark, One-eyed Dragon Karon, Scorpion Hoven, and Razor Huli are four other real power figures in the Bloodstone Camp. Most of them have about 100 fighters, and their strength is between the 12th and the 14th. Among them, the razor Huli is also a 14th-level fighter, but it is said that he never dared to challenge the Thunder Hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody mark has now become the first goal of Richard. He is fierce and brutal. He is a 13th-level warrior. He uses two heavy enchanted short-handed trowels. There is no other special ability except for the natural strength. In Richard's eyes, the bloody mark without special ability is the best target to deal with. With his current team configuration, there are many sets of programs to deal with this type of guy who is only high enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about it, and unconsciously began to wipe the hands that were originally spotless on the horse. When he accidentally saw the gaze of laughter and laughter, Richard was shocked. However, after a moment of embarrassment, he suddenly figured out something, so he calmly put away the square scarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several half-orcs were at the door of the Bloodstone Camp, and the arrival of the Richards team also caused them a commotion. After all, the two ogres were too conspicuous. And that dozens of wind teeth are also a small fighting force. The most important thing is that this group of people is completely strange, not a caravan, and the lineup is not like ordinary adventurers. For these experienced Orc warriors, uniqueness often means trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" said the half-orc captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral threw the bloody mark's nameplate to the half-orc captain, and said to Richard, and said, "My master wants to get some barbarian." Goods, so come and try your luck. We have already paid the road tax." This is also a prepared statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Captain looked at the famous brand, and then looked at the crowds, the cold and proud of the look, the nose wrinkled, spewing two crude gas, Said: "It's Mark's bitch! The bloodstone camp doesn't need to enter the city tax. This thing can't bring you anything. Mark is a nasty guy, so you'd better throw this stuff into Going inside the garbage. In addition, since you have already paid the money, you are simply useless to Mark, unless you want to pay more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, friend!" Oral said sincerely, and handed over a few silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Captain took over the money and looked a little better, but said: "The Orcs and the Elves will not be friends! But I wish you good luck, Go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of hands, the half-orc captain let go of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the bloodstone camp, a strong smell immediately came to the fore! This is a mixture of feces, rotten food, garbage and the smell of slaves who never bathe. It is extremely powerful and comparable to the sixth-order acid mist. For a time, many people have changed their faces, and even the expressions of the two ogres are more exciting. They are fond of food, and the unfortunate sense of smell is also very sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodstone camp is full of high and low houses, and the walls are mostly made of red weathered rock that can be seen everywhere. It can be seen that there has not been a unified planning arrangement. It has formed such a pattern in the long-term disorderly development and competition for territory. However, in general, it still sees the distribution of forces around the spring, such as high wall breaks between some buildings and roadways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the camp stands a five-storey castle building with a sharpened wooden stake that stretches out into the sky, with a strong Orc style. There are several flags floating on the castle, and a bloody warhammer is painted on the dark red background. This is the totem flag of the Bloodstone tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this war-torn, the buildings in the camp are so chaotic that there is almost no style to say. In particular, there is a large slum in the west. The so-called houses in the west are all piled up with three walls of stone. Whatever the top is added, even if it is a house, it is low enough for any adult to bow. To the point, like the shape of Gangde and the Ogre, basically don't want to enter while keeping the walls and roof intact. There are rubbish and dirty water everywhere in the slums, and the flying flies have almost become a cloud of dark clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard passed a lane alley, he saw just a few people in the clothes that were ruined but fierce and looked around the floor. They kept kicking the bags, and one of them even held a wooden stick with nails on the bag, and each time they smashed, the surface of the bag would have a dark color stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bag is constantly twisted, and the ambiguous sound is emitted from it. Most of the size is loaded with a person. The people around them are extremely heavy and extremely ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped the war horse and scanned several people who were murdering, frowning. These people are just ordinary people, but they are not evasive in public. The bloodthirsty and madness make him very uncomfortable. If the blood-stained place is full of such bloodthirsty and madness, then his coping style seems to need to be slightly adjusted. This adjustment is the flow of sand for his choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
