The horses specially equipped for the reloading of the knights were robbed of more than 40 horses. The remaining horses were also devastated. The initial inventory and the number of horses that can be used are only about one hundred. The top horses that can carry the reloading knight still have less than ten horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" The Viscount screamed and his face turned white, and seemed to faint at any time. "There are only ten of my cute and expensive war horses! What's going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Viscount's team, each reloading knight is equipped Two horses. Therefore, half of the gold coins spent on arming a reloading knight are consumed in the war horse. Now there are only ten horses left in the top horses, which means that the tens of thousands of gold coins of the Viscount are dissipated in a vacuum, so how can he not feel bad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general bowed his head and said nothing. In fact, he still has one sentence to say, that is, the main target of the enemy's night attack is not the Viscount, but the horse circle. But once this sentence is spoken, the consequences are very clear. The proud squad of Heim never allowed the enemy's primary goal not to be himself, but a group of animals. In order to clear this shame, the Viscounts of Shim will fight and insult their own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general knows the Viscount very well, at that time it means that his command will be deprived by the Viscount, and then the fate of this army will be worrying. From this night attack, Richard's troops have shown fierce fighting power, come and go like a wind, hit the enemy, and after a heavy blow to the enemy, they will immediately look forward to the battle. Such an enemy, even if the number is less than half of the Viscount army, the general himself will never dare to underestimate it. And if it is directed by Himself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general is ready to take another skunk, and when the visor is tired, he should sleep. The next day dawn, the Viscount will forget what is going on tonight, what to do and what to do. The loss of horses and soldiers was only a few gold coins in the eyes of Him. The most indispensable thing for the Viscount is the gold coin. Although he lost only a few hundred small losses when he lost the gold coin, he would have a heartache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as the storm was going, the Viscount’s Guard Captain walked into the camp. When the general saw the captain of the Guard, his face immediately looked a bit ugly. The captain of the Guard was born with great power and arrogance, and his own ten-level strength was also a slap in the face. The key to his ability to sit in this position is because he is the cousin of the Viscount and is very good at shooting horses and making small reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the first sentence of the Guard Captain is: "The Viscount, the main target of the enemy's night attack tonight seems to be our horse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general only felt that his eyes were black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount immediately screamed: "What do you say?! In the eyes of this group of children, is it true that my identity and bloodlines are noble, my status is still Not as good as a group of animals!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Guards looked heavy and sad: "It seems like this, Viscount."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of damn countrymen! The people who are full of horse dung! I must grab them by hand, each person whipping for ten days, then hanging at the door of my castle to show the crowd. I want Let everyone see clearly, what kind of end is dare to despise and insult me! Tomorrow morning, the whole army is advancing at full speed, I will completely defeat them under the wall of the country!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s temporary camp is located ten kilometers away, which is extremely daring. However, under the night, it was just a night attack, and Richard was absolutely not afraid of the squad of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that mountain night marchers need is to be familiar with the terrain. Even if the army of the Viscounts can really track this, the ten-kilometer road is not long or short, at least it can be consumed. Half of the physical strength of the chase. At that time, waiting for the pursuit of the soldiers will be an ambush. The long blood-stained land is the land that Richard is already very familiar with. The head of the wandering in the blood-stained land is the eye of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the height of the camp and looked at the soldiers who had returned to the camp. The night wind blows on the body, and the coolness is very comfortable, which makes him want to have the urge to growl. He is used to, and likes to feel the control of the battlefield, like the feeling of holding every detail in his hands, accumulating a little bit of advantage in many parts, and finally defeating the enemy in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is called control. Of course, it is possible to bring it, in addition to Richard's true and intelligent talent, as well as power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night after Licha’s night was surging, the twilight appeared quietly, and its breath increased a lot. Richard was surprised and surprised. When a reconnaissance technique passed, he found that the twilight had reached the third level. It seems that this night's battle is fruitful, but the rich and fruitful results should not be promoted so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a full-bodied scent, all abilities can be used, and the third-level should be able to confront the six-level fighters. If in the right circumstances, such as the night or a sneak attack, then the tenth-level fighters are likely to die under its hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the faint faintness makes Richard feel the slight pain of acupuncture, which is the keen perception of the blood of the elf, indicating that the twilight has threatened Li Ability to check. This discovery made Richard feel a bit strange. He is now an 11th-level wizard. The instant three-level magic shield can completely resist the attack of the third-level servants. Weaken the effect. Even so, can twilight threaten him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li thinks, always feels that the battle power of the twilight and the nest tells that some of the information does not match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the night began to surge again, and the water appeared on the other side of Richard. As soon as the girl appeared, her hand pressed on the handle of the perpetual guide, and stared coldly at the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight seems to be a little scared, and immediately recedes into the night, which makes Richard say to the water flower: "Water, don't scare it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl snorted, and said nothing, directly into the night, and the twilight did not stop, and soon disappeared into the dark. Although the two entities disappeared into the field of vision, Richard could fully grasp their position with the soul link. The two guys centered on him, 30 meters apart. On each side of the station, the three people became a straight line. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what the situation is, but the water has always been silent, and even the expression has not changed much. I just rushed and couldn’t see from her expression. Clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the drifting sand came from afar. She seemed to be completely unaware of the strange atmosphere on the scene. She and Richard talked about the results of the night attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These data are naturally already in the heart of Richard, who has two talents, but it still needs to be confirmed once by the sand. In particular, the damage figures of the party and the personal damage of the soldiers are directly in the hands of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
