After all, it is extremely rare to be able to kill the legendary people with the power of the Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black 曜 did not think that this killing god, which made many savagely famous Dakosodas sang also smell, actually lived in Li next door, and Richard is a very familiar look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the black scorpion suddenly thinks of the understatement of Richard’s killing of the Dakosudas, and it is no different from killing God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the night, I only looked at the black scorpion, and if I sat down without a chance, I began to chat casually with Richard. The topic was nothing more than fighting and building. In terms of experience, it seems that I don’t think it’s strange to have a demon in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and White Night talked for half an hour without a margin, and suddenly it was full of excitement. The bursting of the strong guy’s skills was increasingly dense, obviously Another large-scale offensive by Daksodas began. The main direction of this time seems to be the direction in which Richard and White Nights live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the city has become a reef in the sea of ​​anger because of the two of them, no matter how the Dakso Das people stormed, This city has always remained intact. Once, the Dakso Das even broke into the edge of the upper city, completely surrounded the city, and then killed for a few hours, but the final result was not only the dozens of strong players. The body of the corpse, and the same number of strong people were seriously injured, the Dax Sodas still had nothing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this campaign, the Dakso Das people finally understood that they could not deal with these two madmen and monsters only by the ordinary sanctuary. The legendary strongman is only possible, but the legendary strong can be said to be mutually restrained, and now the Dakso Das side can only suppress the legendary strongmen such as Lundstedt, once the legend is over, the suppression effect It will be greatly discounted, but a legend is enough to deal with Richard and White Nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this melee, Lawrence, who is in the center of the battlefield, is safe and sound, and the black scorpion has not been discovered. It is not a big miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the situation is a bit different, the sound of fighting in all directions, but the stone in the small courtyard has not fallen, the Dakso Das seems to Changed the tactics, the war was only carried out in the outer zone of this city, and no longer attacked the White Night and Richard's residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ordinary houses have become the nightmare of the Dax Sodas. No matter what the strong people of the race go in, they have no progress. Therefore, in this battle, they mainly focused on killing other strong human beings, and letting White Night and Richard not leave, only a few scouts were scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night in the room and Richard are still chatting in the north of the sea, not at all anxious, when the door is suddenly knocked open, Richard And the eyes of the white night fell instantly at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who don’t open their eyes, and the two think at the same time, and the fierce pressure is rushing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not the Dakosodas, but the St. Lawrence. The old man is also stared at by Richard and the white night. The eyes turned white, and the eyes were fainting. It was so good to be stared at by the two killing gods at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man came too suddenly, so that Richard and White Night were quite unexpected, and immediately convinced the killing, Lawrence was relieved, and Zhang mouth slammed. After a few words of pain, he was calm and stepped into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man glanced at the black shackles curled up in the shadow of the corner of the house, and he took a chair and sat down, saying to White Night and Richard: " It’s so lively outside, the two of you are chatting here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are like this, Lawrence instantly tweeted the topic in three words, three people It was so eager to start talking again, and all blacks did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black rushing on a feeling of incomprehensibility, the Norland people met him in the past, if not panic, it is like an enemy, what is it like? Now it is simply ignored by people, and the white night is gone. It is estimated that if she changes a little, she can unload herself into more than a dozen pieces, but who is the old man who comes in later, weak into this way, actually Also, he did not put himself in his heart. He suddenly had an idea. It was because of Richard, because they trusted Richard, they took everything around him for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young devil was thinking, the conversation between the three people suddenly stopped. White night said: "Not quite right. It seems that Dax Sodas people are smart, and they refuse to consume power here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Well, their main force is storming up the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence Road "Would you like to go out and kick a kick to the Dak Soudas's ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head and said: "I bet If we go in that direction, we will definitely meet the strong guys of the brigade. Maybe there is still a legend waiting for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Nights Immediately ask: "What should I do?" In terms of strategy, she knew that she was definitely better than Richard, who was born from a plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and said, "Let's go out and see if we can copy the Dakosudas."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be legends there, no, most of them are legendary." Lawrence frowned and stopped, he and Dakosodas had been dealing with them for decades. The habits are well known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just to find their legend." Richard laughed and said, "White night, you drag the legend, I will kill other people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night frowns, not pleased: "Why not I kill, I am much faster than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard gave a very simple reason: "Because I can't drag the legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night nodded and said: "If there is no legend there What to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He revealed a murderous smile and said, "Then it should be a bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just do it, let's go." White night said to go and leave, Richard is not a drag-and-drop person, before the two went out, the white night suddenly turned back and said to St. Lawrence: "Old man, you Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, my luck has always been very good, I don't believe those little rabbits know who I am, I will dare to provoke I "Lawrence put his chest looks banging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White nodded nodded, no longer embarrassed, and Richard quickly went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever cast a slap in the dark, it seems that the devil boy is just a decorative sculpture in the room, and it seems that no one is worried about Lawrence and It is dangerous to stay alone in a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside world is getting more and more fierce, and there will be an amazing fire cloud from time to time throughout the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent roaring explosion has spread into the Upper Town, looking up along the huge street, you can see several large black clouds are rolling forward Resist the long-term glory of the damage and suppression of the Dakosodas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are to the center of the fortress, the more intense the battle, the temperament of various colors and the magical light intertwined, and even occasionally one or two rays are striking The trajectory avoids heavy interception and hits the long-lasting radiant fireball floating in the air. Every attack and attack will make the fireball violently beat for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forefront, the area where the legendary strongmen are in fierce confrontation, ordinary people like Lawrence can’t stay at all, and those horrible skills are almost all cut Space, and even some, directly change the rules within the scope, and the collision of energy and energy is more directly a small explosion, as long as it is affected, it will be annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After White Night and Richard, Lawrence sat thoughtfully for a while, then slowly got up, then the old man seemed to find another room in the house. Living things, turned his head and went up and down to look at the black scorpion for a while, and saw the devil boy in the bottom of his heart, and he not only couldn’t afford to hurt, but even had a feeling of horror, in the eyes of the old man. It seems that my body is being dissected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence looked straight at the devil's lap, all on the back of the cold sweat, this snorted, took a duck step, Shiran left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young devil is quietly in the shadows, with no thought of any change, and the two instructions of Richard, will always echo in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lawrence returned to his room, closed the door, and then leaned on the door, slammed his chest, and immediately sweated, he endured I can't help but swear: "This stinky boy, raising something bad, actually raised an adult demon, doing him / milk / milk, actually did not have any control measures, can scare my old man, but also I was in the past, now I can't do this thing, stinky boy, wait for you to come back and see that I don't clean up you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
