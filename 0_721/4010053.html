			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma does not know when to stand up and stuff the magic paper of the communication into In the breastplate, while licking his mouth with the other hand, he yawned in a row and said to himself: "No, the little guy always gets a lot of trouble, I still go see it myself. It's better for him. But his luck has always been good. There shouldn't be something right... um, let's take a look. If you look at it, you can rest assured. Also, I don't know if he is handsome. I also had an arrow for him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another plane, Wald, who stood on the desolate Gobi, also received the message, but He just pinched it, and the piece of paper was actually pinched in his giant hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Stinky boy, wait for you to have half the power of Gordon, and come and order me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; The third plane is the plane where Axiris and Serdong are co-located, and they also received a briefing from Richard. But the reaction of the two people is quite the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must go back! Gordon has saved my life." Asiris said slowly, the dark teachings in his hands were rapidly turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you really think about Gordon, you should stay here, instead of going back to see the little guy who hasn’t grown up!" Irony. In his hands, the two daggers flickered, like two fish, flying fast between the fingers. A sharp murderous continually points to the key points of Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to betray the Lord Gordon?" Achilles' voice was a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! I will never betray the Gotton! But this does not mean that I want to be equally loyal to the sons and daughters of Gordon!" Sharp channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris was silent for a moment before saying, "If this is the case, then I will go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seldon yelled angrily: "You are crazy! Going back to do something, just to show loyalty to that little thing? You are gone, what about this plane? You want me to get the half of the other party. Is God avatar? How does it look like Norland’s legend? Is it true that one day, when Gordon will come back, will we see that we are only playing a base in this plane? No, say Maybe even the forward base will be hit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go back and see if there is nothing, I will come back soon. You...stay on it." Asiris said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell! The time flow here is five times that of Noland! How do you stick with a little delay? Look at it, look below These army! This is how we cultivated, they are also life, tens of thousands of lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris took a deep breath and said: "We don't know the situation on the floating island. You said these are excuses. So, this time I have to go back. If you feel that you can't cope with it alone, then... retreat!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sel Winter, sneer, and said: "Good! Retreat! We played for a full six months, and once the retreat, the site was returned to the enemy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris no longer said more, but opened the dark teachings, a portal was generated in front of him, and then he directly crossed in, ignoring nothing Seldon was screaming at the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the plane that originally belonged to the Schumpeter family, Dragon Master Lina was resting in a temporary camp. The camp was arranged in a hurry, the tents were not so neat, and they were covered with wounded soldiers. They were full of snoring and bloody everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the guards sent Richard’s message, Lina was holding a silver knife and a little bit of carrion in the thigh wound. There, an arrow with blue light is emerging from the silk muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the magic letterhead and glanced over it. Suddenly she yelled: "Is the little guy back?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she was so excited, the movement on her hand was a little bigger, and the silver knife picked the arrow out, and she hurt her teeth. There is a root barb on the arrow, which is very vicious. Originally, Lina handled the arrow carefully, and the action was slightly larger under the excitement. The pointed arrow had a small half barb on which the pork was hung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the shredded pork that was pulled out, Master Long hated his teeth. She called a pastor and crossed the injured thigh in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastor is already old, and the wrinkles are all the nicks of the years, but the level is only eight. It seems that until the end of life, there is no hope to cross the 10th level. Seeing this long, straight, snowy thigh in front of the eye, the old priest's throat section rolled up and down sharply, while the body was slightly bowed to cover up some of the obvious changes on the lower abdomen. The change in that place was too intense, and even the wide robes could not be blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therapy! Once! Hurry up!" Lina sipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest’s dull gaze returned to normal, and he quickly closed his eyes and began to recite the spell, but for him it should be easy to cure the spell but successively I missed it twice, and I wasted a lot of divine power. The old priest suddenly felt that the wind blowing in the face had some bitter coolness, which was the murderousness of the Dragon Master. He suddenly came out with a cold sweat and finally was able to concentrate on a treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the magic flashed over, and a group of pale blue water floated on the wound on the dragon's thigh, and the color of the flesh returned to normal. But obviously not enough. The old priest was about to prepare for the second treatment, but was interrupted by Lina: "Keep your divine power to treat the seriously wounded there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But, Lina, your wound needs at least two treatments..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina angered: "Let you go to you Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the old priest Zhang Huang fled, Long Master sighed and took out a bottle of therapeutic potion and poured it on the thigh's wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a light creamy white medicine, when you touch the wound, it instantly boils, and a large piece of foam is formed, which is constantly pungent. Lina knew that the toxins contaminated by the wound were being removed, but the whole process was so painful that her face was a little white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is derived from the magical or alchemy treatments, the effect is not as good as the direct application of the priest, and often causes pain. The stronger the effect, the greater the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it is not in the development period of the new plane, even if it enters a period of steady expansion, the pastor recruited by the ectopic plane troops is still extremely rare, that The incompetent old pastor is already the highest rank. A small amount of treatment was assigned to the seriously wounded soldier by the Dragon Master. If it was not the therapeutic agent that could not contain the poisoned wound, she would not even need this treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
