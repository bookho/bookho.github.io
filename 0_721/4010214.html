			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looks pale and sees that Richard’s left hand is empty, even half a bit When the shadow of the fireball is gone, the face is even more ugly. I was actually cheated by Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, the whole battle was awkward from the start, and Nyris did not have a pain. Richard’s way of fighting always makes him very uncomfortable. When he is full of strength, he is afraid of being fooled. If he does not dare to do his best, he will be beaten by Richard. He defended it until the end, and finally planted under Richard's deception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! Who are you studying with these mean tricks?" Neris asked angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris immediately decided not to entangle in this matter. After letting go of this attachment, he immediately discovered another question. How can Richard fight him like a warrior for so long? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard showed the magical armed forces, Nyris was completely shocked. He was shocked by the fact that there would be such a wonderful structure, and the second was the shock of the speed of the improvement of the level of construction. At this point in time, can Richard make a third-order construction? At present, Richard can at least sit on the same level as Luno, and in the near future, Richard will become a big builder, even a holy constructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the function of the magical armed forces themselves, Nyris is not very recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland has formed a clear division of labor for thousands of years. The warrior is the warrior, the mages are the mages, and the gods are the gods. Everyone is bent on going further in their profession, rather than trying to distract other areas. For example, Nyris will not try magic, and will not go to school at the first level. He is not learning magic, nor is he not talented. If he goes on the road of magic, he will at least be a great magician. However, Nyris can easily cross the sanctuary in the battle, so he will only fully develop the battle, and will not consider magic at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the magical armor mimics the temperament with magic, so that the magician has the ability of some comrades, completely Hulai. And it also occupies a valuable position. Since Richard is a magician, it is good to focus on the magic of great power, why bother to get one of these things on the body. Protecting the magician is a matter of the warrior. As for the duel, if you follow the rules completely, the magician does not have to fear the warrior, instead of fighting with the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and did not argue with Nyris. Only after going to the absolute battlefield can you understand why St. Lawrence designed the magical arm. Magicians can't be protected forever. Once they are single, they need to be single-handed, especially when they are close to themselves. A dead magician will not cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical arm is not only the way the magician saves his life, but also the means of fighting to kill the enemy. It is like Richard's dealing with Nyris. As long as you can put the enemy down, there is no need to distinguish between the methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this battle, Richard has fully realized the power of the magical armed forces, but Nyris is not so happy. He kept muttering, and if he could use the power of seventeenth level, he would surely make Richard look good. Look at that tangled look, like a little beauty who has just been taken advantage of by men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee will not take care of Nyris's awkward tangle, he will then deliver to Nyris a set of wild strikes, ready to exchange magic materials. The damn magical armor made his material reserves empty, and if he didn't add it, he would soon face a dilemma. And in the near future, there will be one more Qiqi who consumes magical materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying goodbye to Nyris, Richard returned to his own home and began to practice meditation and drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Nyris sent the magic book and magic material. So Richard continued to draw the suit. Outside the city, the day-to-day logging of the soldiers opened the way to the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunpowder was quickly used up, but in the dark blue, the second batch of gunpowder was sent in time. This time instead of using the expensive remote transmission magic array, it is transported using the Wyvern. So the number reached ten tons, enough for Lee to spend a long time. As soon as gunpowder arrived, the progress of logging was immediately accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months passed quickly, and the 30-kilometer road leading to the Tree of Life has been opened. The situation in the tree of life is stable and there is no difference. The soldiers stationed in the tree of life are so mad that they are going crazy, and they even start to be eager to take a trip, which is better than repeating day after day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing this situation, Richard arranged for the guards of the tree of life to enter the rotation system, and changed the class every three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison and the elves have also had a conflict. The reason is that several warriors feel that these attached elves are slaves, and they are consciously superior, and the green elf throws If you open the skin tone totem, it looks really good. Although it is not comparable to Norland's high elves, it is above the average human level. Therefore, a few flustered warriors couldn’t help but put a single female elf in the tree house, ready to enjoy the eclipse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers are very miserable, one death and three injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green elves have the same equal strength for men and women, and the average level of adult elves is more than ten. Moreover, they are wild and difficult to tame, and they have always had a strong killing. Most of the reasons for surrendering are the tree of life. The small part is the elder tribe elder. These warriors touched the core of the elves' most cherished, glory and purity. As a result, the female elves suddenly broke out, and after they hit them, they broke into the forest and never knew where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garrison and elf tribes then completely entered a state of tension and opposition, and wartime may occur. The garrison soldiers asked the Elf tribe to hand over the murderer, while the Elf tribe asked for severe punishment of several soldiers who attempted to rape or rape. If it weren’t for the elite humanoid knights and the elves’ elders to be pressed in time, it would have been a fire show. Really want to fight, even if there are five elite knights, these soldiers are not enough to kill the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning about this, Richard first issued an order to the elite human knight, arrested several soldiers who had committed the crime, and then sent it back to the base city before publicizing it. Trial, then all executed. The wounded female elf was declared innocent, and the elder elder and the elder Druid were invited to the base city to supervise the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was made, the anger of the Elf tribe quickly subsided, and the human warrior was in vain. Most of them came from the original Li Na's subordinates. Long Master's leader has always been relaxed and easygoing. Where have they seen such a severe military discipline? Moreover, in the ectopic plane, the commanders have always turned a blind eye because of the long-term disengagement of the soldiers, and the commanders have always turned a blind eye. This is also the unspoken rule of most plane war troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the five elite knights were extremely hot, killing several warriors who took the lead on the spot, and this took the scene down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days, three injured soldiers were hanged in the central square of the base city. Elder elders and Elder Druid watched the whole process of execution. At this point, the doubts about Richard have been eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
