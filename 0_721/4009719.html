			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are slow and meticulous, write two numbers It doesn't take much time. The gray dwarf reluctantly closed the book, took out a report about Richard, and began reading. This is a complete account, recording the daily activities, subjects and expenses of Richard in chronological order. A similar report will have one per day, but the content is almost the same. Seeing the dense subjects and experiments above, the gray dwarf could not help but be dizzy. In some cases, he would have thought that Richard was not a human being at all, but a magical scorpion with an alchemy machine as its core. Otherwise, how could it be possible to study and study for a few years, and almost no entertainment time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Black Gold’s clear, his own schedule is very full, but a lot of so-called work time is actually for him, such as Said to identify the value of a batch of jewelry ore. And Richard is living in strict accordance with the optimal time utilization plan, and does not show any personal hobbies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dense running account in the hand, the gray dwarf's breathing involuntarily became thicker. Just looking at this list, a heavy sense of oppression is coming. If you see a similar list every day, the accumulated pressure will be maddening. The gray dwarf will see such a thing every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt very sympathetic to Stevenson, and felt that this guy did not be as stupid as he thought. If you get along with Stevenson, maybe the Grey Dwarf has already started. Richard is like an ancient Bi Meng who is running at full speed. All the obstacles in front of him will be ruthlessly hit. Stevenson just happened to play this unfortunate role. If there is no such a guy, then the Dragon Warlock is likely to shine in the dark blue. But who asked Su Hailun to set such a strange rule, there is only one way for her to lead the builders here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck, sometimes it’s really a factor that can determine everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is obviously an unlucky guy, and his strength... Gray dwarf once again looked at the running account and felt the strength of Stevenson It doesn't seem to be dominant now. According to Richard's current progress, when it comes to Stevenson's age, the strength has long been known how much more than the Dragon Warlock. The Archimonde family is really a madman. Even the original magical talent detection of the unremarkable Richard is also a madman. He can actually catch up with the magic progress of others by diligence, and his horror talent in the magical structure. Then people can't understand it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case... The Grey Dwarf suddenly made a lot of thoughts, and the heart accelerated by the excitement. In his eyes, Stevenson is a vein that will be exhausted and will soon be hollowed out. However, the mines that have just dried up will have a lot of value to be excavated. For example, scattered ore deposits around the main veins, such as associated ore, and even waste residue, may also extract many rare metals, provided that there is dwarf smelting technology. . The Grey Dwarf started out by buying waste mines at a low price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dickenson digs well, it must be worth more than ten waste mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf has already conceived several plans and made it again. It feels that it works. As for the future, the Duke of Soram will find that he has suffered a big loss sooner or later, but what can he do? Challenge deep blue? Oh, this option does not exist. Point the goal of hatred to Richard? It’s a good idea. A Viscount of the Akmon family made the Soram and the Neo-Arab defeated. Then they challenged the Gotton who successfully entered the floating world with only 13 knights. The Grey Dwarf feels that the brains of the legendary profession should not seem so stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
