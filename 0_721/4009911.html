			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the planes, war and plunder are the eternal themes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland is not the only main plane, and the power of many known planes is not under Noland, such as Hell and the Abyss, Heaven and Astral. Some special forms of planes also have the power to not lose the main plane, such as elements and shadow planes. The relationship between these known planes and Noland is not what ordinary people think, but it is only in the legend; it is not that some theologians say that the two sides will get along with each other, only conflicts and wars. It is the normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Noland’s human giants are bent on expanding toward other planes, many planes also see Noland as a possible conquest. From time to time, there will be strong planes passing through the time, setting up a plane passage leading to Noland, trying to conquer this rich and beautiful plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Noland’s power system and vast area, it is almost impossible to rely solely on violent conquest. After all, the number of channels that can be transmitted by each plane is quite limited. . But when the base is large enough, the absolute number of idiots will be large enough, so there will always be a hot face of the ectopic face, trying to attack Noland. However, the warrior that they sent over often could not conquer even a count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every day there are incidents of multiple or multiple intrusions, so the gods of Noland will not release the gods for this, even The police will not do it. After all, there are too many numbers, and the gods may not be bored, but the human and material resources of believers are limited. What about the intruder? Quite simply, since Noland is a constant war, what is the difference between the ectopic face and the enemy of the plane? In contrast, intruders are more likely to deal with things, without thinking about politics, balance of power, blood revenge and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the eternal and time dragons dominate the Noland, the status of the gods is not as supreme as other sub-planets. A large number of legendary powerhouses are planning to go further and they can advance into the realm of demigod, and then go further... So how can they purely worship the gods who are not far from the faith? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common rule is that the more powerful the plane, such as all the main planes, the lower the status of the gods that need faith support. The existence of high and high, all detached, does not require faith, such as the dragon of eternal and time, and the god of God who has never been verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, as the strong master of the main plane, I am very familiar with and understand the abyss and hell that often visit Noland. Even the first emperors of the Holy Alliance organized an unprecedented expedition. The other side of the understanding comes from the innumerable invasion of Noland's two major systems in history. All the invasions will undoubtedly end in failure. Only the big devils and the big devils have the chance to return to hell and the abyss. The ordinary soldiers are not left, and all will die in Noland. This is not the stupidity of the powerful lords who fight with the gods, but the need to cut the number of demons and devils at the bottom, and is also a means of training. Only the strong who can survive the harsh plane wars are valuable, and they are eligible to join the abyss and the deepest part of hell, the never-ending jihad, fighting for more powerful forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Noland, the Schumpeter family is well-known at least in the human kingdom. Being able to occupy a floating island in Faust is not only a symbol of strength and status, but also a real benefit. There are more opportunities to contact the Eternal Dragon Hall, and naturally you will receive God's grace beyond expectations. The unexpected life extension of a strong man, a new plane coordinate, or a powerful artifact is the base point for the rise of family power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
