			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A four-storey old red brick building in Zhenbei is the deliberation of the Masters Association Institution, the seat of the Elder Council. This building is not big, but it has been more than 500 years old. Although it has been repaired and decorated many times during the period, the appearance still retains the simplicity of the town when it was first built. I don’t know how many decisions that ultimately affect the whole kingdom are Made here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fourth floor, each of the sixteen Grand Magi elders has a separate office. There are 30 offices on this floor, and now it’s naturally half empty. But in the heyday of the Masters Association, the fourth layer was not only full, but also the great magister who could not apply for the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the number of great magisters, it can be seen that the Sequoia kingdom's power is already in full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another evidence is that, over the past 100 years, as the power of the Masters Association has grown larger, the number of mages has decreased year by year. There are fewer than 600 people in the kingdom who are registered with the eighth grade or above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline of the Masters Association is only a superficial phenomenon, and in fact the association’s income has not decreased. Although the number of mages is small, the number of goods such as enchanting equipment is also small, but the association has successfully tripled the price of enchanting equipment over the past few years, while the price of kingdom wheat has only increased by 5%. . Therefore, the interests of the elders in the association have increased several times, because the cake is not small, and the cake is cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many great mages do not like to work in this building, except for meetings, almost never appear. But some people like it here, preferring to sit here and enjoy the taste of power that has been deposited in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan sat in the office almost every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most outstanding magical genius of the Sequoia Kingdom in recent years, Ryan became the youngest elder of the association, and became the vice president of the association last year. The robe was also replaced by the elder's red robe with a special dark gold robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three Dark Gold Masters throughout the Masters Association. That is, the president of the association, Ryan, and a 18-level magister. The great magister is the most powerful magician in the association, but he is not in Lausanne for many years. His magic tower was built on the northern border and is said to be guarding a huge magic spar mine where the dwarf slaves of the entire tribe are mining for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan sat in his office, holding a cup of black coffee and looking at the report in his hand. At his desk, there stood a middle-aged mage, and the golden robe showed that his status in the association was not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of ten sets of enchantment equipment were seized?" asked Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! President of the President. And this is ten sets of equipment that can arm a soldier from the head to the feet! Your Excellency."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things, take me to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe said: "It has been placed downstairs, please Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in a dark warehouse, Master Jinpao personally opened two sealed magic boxes and displayed the equipment inside. . Ryan first picked up a long sword and used magic to excite it. The sword immediately swayed the magical light of the blue water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the fine swords of good grades are impeccable from the technique, the material to the workmanship. According to your opinion, what is the quality of this sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It should be similar to the boutique exported by the association." Master Jin Pao said cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan laughed and threw the long sword back into the enchantment box and said, "Boutique? Can those low-level wizards make this level of quality? I personally It’s just like this, but in my opinion, only the works of the old man who studies the enchantment in the entire association can surpass it. But can a few pieces of enchanting products be produced by Bank in a month? The thing is enough for him to do it in a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe was shocked by Ryan’s words, and the look of the magic box became somewhat The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan asked again: "Is these things flowing from the hands of Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes! I have traced it in detail. These equipments were sent back by the Bark of Chuckert, and it is said to be used for the guards of the Earl of Burr. The Baron Chaket is an active member of the line plan. It is still in the bloody area. Needless to say, the source of this equipment must be Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a moment, Master Jinpao said with anxiety "Your, I heard that in the blood-stained area, the price of Richard's sale of magic equipment is lower than the cost of the association! This is not a good thing. If this continues, the nobles will buy the things of Richard."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Golden Robe Master did not expect this comment to be appreciated by Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan sneered and said: "The cost is lower than the association. Is it really weird? It’s not that Richard’s price is low, but our cost is too high. You think about it, what is the cost of a magical equipment produced by the association? One kilogram of Lafite iron, the purchase price of the association is three times higher than the price of the outside market. In addition, the cost of the magician How are they calculated? For example, the sharp character of Master Moses, the magic array is ready-made, he only needs a magic equivalent to six levels of magic, and it takes three minutes to complete before and after. Will bring him five hundred gold coins of income. Hey, three hundred minutes to earn five hundred gold coins, that is, I am also very willing to do it! This is the cost of our association!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe Master was shocked, he did not expect Ryan to be so thorough, and so unrelenting. For a time he did not know how to respond. Past experience has taught him that such a dialogue is full of opportunities and may be a deadly trap. Ryan slowed down some of his tone and said: "In fact, more than a hundred years ago, the quality of the enchanting equipment produced by the association was much better than it is now, not even before us." The difference is that. And the price at that time is also lower than that of Richard’s blood-stained land. However, it was more than a hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe does not know how to answer, but has to vaguely answer, then ask: "How is the cargo of the President, Earl of Burr?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the bottom of Richard's bottom detected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe master daringly said: "Checking! There is a clue to say Li It seems that there is some connection with the Principality of Baiyan. However, you know that the relationship between the Masters Association of Baiyan Principality and us is not pleasant. So it can only be done in secret. This... takes time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan nodded and said, "This thing is coming slowly. Anyway, he can't run there. But the Earl of Burr can't just forget it. I remember that the association has stipulated that the sale of large-scale magic equipment within the kingdom must pass the association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan’s voice turned cold: “That’s it, you bring a group of people, in the name of the association, secretly count the Earl of Burr Brought to Lausanne for trial, the crime is smuggling magic equipment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe Master was shocked, busy: "President, arresting the local aristocracy is a big event ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan asked: "Is there a precedent just a few years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not the same! It was just a little baron, and this time it was the count! A bad one, this event is likely to stir up the intervention of the royal family and other great nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp Ryan sneered: "No, Burr is a neutral aristocrat. Neutral nobility has no factions, but no asylum seekers. We just need to catch him. Others can only protest at most, are they not?" Are you really fighting against the Masters Association? Now, it’s the time when the association shows strength!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robe Master’s heart, finally know Well no means limited to the ambitions of the Master Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha spent a rare half-month of calm time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daily life is to draw the makeup and meditation, to restore the magic. The quiet state of life has accelerated the speed at which Richard has drawn the structure. After fifteen days, Richard has created eight pieces of fabric and the magic has returned to the 12th level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the blood-stained land is stable, and the followers of Richard’s follow-up attacked each other, threatening the stables running through the road. This trade route is almost everywhere in gold, and a lot of horses smell the smell of gold coins and swarm. They did not dare to move the super-large-scale caravans formed by the nobility, but they were coveted by the various small caravans that were on the road. Moreover, Ma Yuzhong also has a lot of ulterior motives, such as the red Cossack's remnants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great interest of Shanglu is enough to make people crazy, the horses in the bloody place are fierce and cruel, persuading is of course useless, and intimidation has no effect, so Li The order of the inspection is to be within 50 kilometers of both sides of the commercial road. As long as the horse is found, it will kill the innocent. Killing a lot, the surviving stables will naturally become smarter, knowing that cheese can't be moved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Iron Triangle Empire was extremely angry at the fact that all the strongholds in the blood-stained land were removed by Richard, and had sent an envoy to ask the Sequoia Kingdom to hand over Li come out. The Sequoia Kingdom certainly cannot promise. In the blood-stained land, the interests of half of the kingdoms of the kingdom have been tied up with Richard, and although the growth of these nobles may slowly affect the balance of power in the country, in general, It is still conducive to the growth of national strength, how can the kingdom break its arms. The Iron Triangle Empire has long known the results, but in order to appease the aristocrats in the country, it is necessary to know what is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is politics, and this is diplomacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire and Richard actually have had two wars. When the blue water meat grinder was in service, the power of Saranwell’s shackles was heavy. In the battle of the two vertical lines, the empire's powerful Earl of Lambert was vulnerable to Richard. The blue camp and the caravan guards were all elites of the Earl, and the result was completely ruined. In addition, three of the eight positions removed by Richard belong to the Count of Rambot. Before and after, Lambert had already lost more than four thousand elites under Richard, and also lost two Sanctuary strongmen. Not to mention the count, even for a duke, this loss will be insomnia for several nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
