			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the guardian elves mostly comes from the blessing and protection of the forest will, and the guardian elves will be greatly weakened around the portal without the forest will. It is certainly not the opponent of Xiong Peter who can be listed on the floating island giants. There is a forest will, and Xiong Peter can only slowly expand in the sphere of influence of the green forest, but in order to shock the guardian spirit and the Druids, Xiong Peter There is no such thing as using cruelty on the captives. The most famous one is the four lighthouses set up in the corners of the base city. The light of the forest, the light of the lighthouse, is the body and soul of the guardian spirit. Of course, the light of the forest is not used to identify the orientation. Their only function is to let the guardian elves who observe the base city secretly see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s perception is very keen. When they see the light of the lighthouse, they can faintly hear the crying of the guardian elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of these four lighthouses is also historical. The purpose of the plane development has never been simply killing, but conquest, and the pioneers have come to a new position. After the face, the first thing I want is the indigenous surrender of the plane. The collection and mining of a large amount of resources requires labor. There is no more suitable resource exploitation than the indigenous people. But the green guardian elves are notoriously stubborn. Refusing to accept all the outsiders, the way to refuse is not to expel, but to kill. In the early stage of the plane development, once the Xiong Peter family fighters were captured, the capital is benevolent treatment, they are often stripped by the elves. The skin was then driven back to the base city. After so many things, the Xiong Peter family built the light of the forest, tortured the soul as a revenge against the elves. The situation of the plane was deadlocked for hundreds of years, and the hatred of both sides was The spiral rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the distance, tribes such as Aoba did not come into contact with the Schumpeter family, but they certainly heard a lot about their deeds. Therefore, to guard the elves' blind obedience to the tree of life and the will of the forest, it is obvious that Richard has the will of the forest will, and still can't help but start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard Yan smiled and said: "I know who you are talking about, those guys are called Xiong Peter, they have been defeated by me, so everything left behind I received it. As for the light of the four forests, I have already let it go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline’s face was a little gentler, saying: However, the guardian elves who died under your hand are more than Schumpeter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha asked: "It seems that there are many deaths in your hands. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lin was a slogan. When she fled, there were indeed many hunters who had chased her. The daughter of the forest was also synonymous with strong combat power. However, this is the same as how Richard can, so he argued: "But this is not the same." We are a war between the tribes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War is a war." Richard interrupted Melin’s words and said, "This time makes me I verified an idea in my heart that the world tree here does not welcome outsiders. It hates and wants to destroy all the outsiders. You are a night elf, not a guardian elf. In the eyes of the guardian elves, the night elves are also foreign. The only reason why they didn't have big moves in the past is because the elders and the tree of life, as long as the elders are not there, they will start, there is no room for compromise. From this point of view, you have no night elves and I have no Any difference, or you think, breeding is better than being killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline doesn't know how she left, she didn't ask herself what she wanted Something The heart is completely a mess, and like many night elves, she always thought that she was a member of the guardian elf and worshipped the world tree, but now, Richard has revealed her cruel reality, from beginning to end. The guardian elves always remember the identity of their outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Melin left, under the cover of the night, a gaze followed her figure until she disappeared into the crown of the tree of life, and then the gaze It fell on the tree house of Richard and looked at it with great enthusiasm. Then it quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard in the tree house suddenly looked up and looked out the window. If he thought about it, he immediately put a little bit of disappointment in his heart, most of the night elves. They also think that they are part of the guardian elves. They naturally have no good impression of themselves, and even if they know history, they will not change. The high elves of the Yongye Forest Elf Wang Ting have fallen to nothing. At the same time, the so-called Big Elf Kings only lead a small tribe of the tribe, but still do not change the arrogant style, they look down on any race other than the high elves, even in the high elves inside the three or six, etc. Come, so dealing with the high elves is never a pleasant thing, even if they fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the record left by Elf Wang Ting, the high elves at that time used to talk about the glory of the elf empire, and did not put the human empire outside the forest In the eyes, it was a kind of arrogance that the oldest ancestors also had. I remember that when I saw these records, Richard was also quite dumbfounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, his hostility to the elves is not taken for granted. Anyway, the elf's hatred does not need any reason. There are also different people in the high elves. For example, 茜, 梅琳 are treated as friendly to outsiders, but in Richard's memory, Elanyi is more gentle, she is very friendly and enthusiastic about each of the small villages. As the only magician and doctor in the mountain village, everyone has received her help. Now it seems that they are all elves. A heterogeneous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night passed quickly, and again, Richard never left his tree house, only eating some fruit during the period, he was studying hard To annihilate the information of the plane, the tree of life in the night is much stronger than the tree of life of his own, and there is much more support for him. Richard will spend a lot of energy to start thinking, and it will take a long time. The supplement is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson Plane has no moon, and the elves of the Everlasting Tribe calculate the time with the tide of the Moon Well, while Richard is relying on the direct sensing month. The way to judge the time, now is the most intense time of the month, that is, at midnight, when Richard is thinking hard, there are a few light rays floating in front of him, and then gathered into an image, this is a Lin Jing The scene of her upper body is the human body, and the lower body is the forest white deer. After she appeared, she said, "Richard, I am the tree of life around you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very surprised: "You can make your will appear, other life trees will have this ability in the full body stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am from the tree of life of the Elf Wang Ting, how can I compare it with those small trees." The Everlasting Life Tree is obviously somewhat unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee laughed and said: "Those who are not small trees, well, what are you coming to find me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders are ready to fight with Iscara."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Huo stood up: "When,." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soon, maybe it’s tonight, you can see it." Saying, the forest tree turned into a handful of waves, just in Richard In front of the room, the image in the room was displayed. He was sitting in front of the case and writing something on the paper spread out in front of him. It was obvious that she wrote a word very hard and her hands were shaking and the image was somewhat Obscured, but only at the beginning, Richard knew that he was writing a suicide note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the image, the cockroaches are entwined with layers of rich gray aerosols. They occasionally shoot out a glimpse of the surroundings, and then they hit an invisible barrier and are blocked. These gray fogs have their own ideas and Life is actually absorbed on the energy barrier, and it constantly erodes and transforms the barrier that blocks them. From the perspective of Richard, it is the gray spot of the east and the west. It is a horrible horror. This is the curse of Iscara, blocking them. The barrier is naturally established by the Everlasting Life Tree, and only the Tree of Life, which can provide a huge force, can block the curse of Iscara without any loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is ready to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Tree replied: "The Great Elders will notify me." Then I will transfer the whole room to the void outside the crystal wall, where is the battlefield with Iscara, so that Iscara will not gain a foothold here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I have already written the letter and loaded two envelopes, one of which is for Richard, and the other is for Melin’s name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When she decides to leave, I will also send me to that house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The tree of life was taken aback. "You have to go with her, this can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the idea of ​​the tree of life and says, "I Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life does not believe at all: "But that is Iskara."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You don't know what Iscara is, don't you, but I know, and I can say, I can come back, as long as you give me a clear coordinate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The coordinates are ok, but..." The persuasion of the tree of life did not work, because at this time, 茜 has begun to replace the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her robe like a shroud, revealing a body like a sly body, and took a deep breath, a strong radiance From the brows of her eyebrows, the whole room was dyed with a layer of gold for a time, and the majestic power surged in the squatting body, and then her body quickly filled and plump, and instantly became an elf. Girl, beauty As always, her body is not as weak as the ordinary elf, but under the perfect curve, it shows the explosive power feeling, which is the perfect combination of strength and beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
