Richard held up a long knife burning with the flame, and then slowly pressed forward. So behind him, various roars and screams rang, and the wicked and wicked guys armed with the flames of the holy flames screamed at the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fastest is the splash, the girl’s feet stepping on the mud like a flat, instantly swept past Richard, into the undead creatures . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, the blossoming water is slowly spreading out, like a lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures were ignited, and they were as eye-catching as the torch. They outlined a path of flames in the dense fog swamp. The sacred flame of the sand is great for undead creatures, far beyond the wildest imagination of everyone. The line of nearly undead creatures is as vulnerable as a melted cheese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore everyone cleaned up all the undead and came to the center of the swamp, and the effect of the flame of Richard's knife edge disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An isolated island appears in the vision of Richard. The most striking thing on the island is a two-story building. It seems that the old days have been a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, thin man is standing in front of the door. He looked like he was in his thirties, his hair was loosely distracted, and the two deep blue-eyed bags were as impressive as the pale complexion. The mage's robe on his body was so dirty that he couldn't see the original look, and there was no blood on his lips. If the chest is still slightly ups and downs, it is no different from the zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha set foot on the island, slamming, rubbing the long knife on the ground, squinting at the man in front of the small building, said faintly "I really want to control my magical pet, the courage is really big enough! Is this a robbery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man frowned, his eyes stayed on the drifting sand, In a hoarse voice, he said: "A terrible priest!" Then his eyes swept over other people. When he saw the water, the pupil couldn’t help but shrink slightly. Obviously, the spirit of the counterattack gave him the impression, or It is painful and extremely profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end, his gaze fell back to Richard, frowning involuntarily, and asked indefinitely: "Mr. Master?" Just now What impressed him was a large-scale killing knife that followed one record, but now he feels a very strong magical fluctuation in Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine-level magician." Richard replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men observe other people, Richard directly throws a detection technique. The strange thing is that the other person does not feel like it, and it is useless. Magic shield. The feedback came back to surprise Richard, a 12-level undead mage with more than 90 loads and up to six construction positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undead Master took a deep look at Richard and said, "So respectful gentleman, according to the tradition between the Masters, I want to have a magic with you alone." Duel. Although my rank is higher than you, I have lost all the servants, and only less than a quarter of the magic is left. So this request is not unfair."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with deep meaning: "The tradition of the Master? In the eyes of other Masters, do you think that you are also one of them?" In addition to the natural evil planes in the abyss and hell, Even the place under the control of most of the dark gods has no good feelings for the undead master who invades the peace of the deceased and plays with the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's face changed greatly, and then he became distorted and screamed: "It is also true. Since people all over the mainland think that we are evil and bloodthirsty, then think so! I don't want to kill people, so I have already hid. Here, I did not expect it to be found by you. Since you refuse to recognize my rights as a mage, come together! I will tear you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Chazi looked at the Necromancer carefully and carefully, and the numbers in the field of vision gradually became clear. His magic is really low, and almost all the permanent summons are killed, a necromancer without undead, like a reloading knight without riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard has already developed the next tactics, so he said: "Although you are not recognized by other mages, I am still willing to follow. The mage tradition and you have a magic showdown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head! Don't you need to do this? We swarm up and just put this guy down and don't do it." Do you deal with Mintai not doing this?" The fairy poet said. He was the last one to be baptized by the sand. Now the holy flame on the longbow has not been extinguished, and the arrow that is shot has a great threat to the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichai waved his hand and stopped the elf poet and said, "No, he is not the same as Mintai. This is a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage? Although the Necromancer is also a mage, Oral does not understand why the Master and the Warrior should be treated differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead Master’s stiff face is one of them. He sorted out the Master's Gown and went up two steps. He said seriously: "My name is Sandru, the 12th-level necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long knife arbitrarily inserted aside and took a step and replied: "Licha, a nine-level magician and a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing' The word "Magic sculpt", Sandro's face flashed a trace of doubt, obviously did not hear about this profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic matchup soon began, and Richard and Sander were separated by 20 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sander began to mourn the spell, although he could not immediately judge the magic type from the language, he immediately saw a dark gray magic in front of the undead mage. In the array, there is a strong death force, and this force has been pulsating since its formation. It seems that there is something to break out. With magical induction, Richard judged that this should be an undead creature summoning, to the level of Sandru, obviously a high-level undead creature will soon appear in this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array is constantly diverging the negative energy of fear, ghastness, horror, etc. The undead has not yet appeared and has passed on such a strong spiritual influence, obviously this It is a powerful magic, the only drawback is that the casting time is too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard didn’t mean to cast magic at all, just took the residual page of the book that was carried from his arms, and shook it with a slap in the face, five fierce wolves It appears on the battlefield! They roared and swarmed, and a dozen or so sensational green and blue rays swayed in the surface of the Necromancer. It was the Master's body magic, and the two fierce wolves were bounced off, but still left a few The powerful momentum of the head fell, preparing half of the undead to summon natural interruptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited patiently for a moment, until Sandro was going to be unable to support it, and then waved out a drive to break down the five fierce wolves into pure Magic energy. Under the attack of five fierce wolves, the physical shield's bodyguard spells have almost disappeared, and the sorcerer's robe of Sandro's body has almost become a root strip, which is bruised and bruised, but the magical defense effect of the vital parts is still faltering. There is no fatal injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
