If the elders decide to kill him, then the participation in any holy scripture is a dead end. The second thought is that the elders also know that this method is too disgraceful and unwilling to be open, so they use the despicable means of subdue. Afterwards, I will push it all over again, and the elders may have any scruples. They are not willing to get rid of it directly. If you seize this point and make things big, maybe there will be some turning points. However, when he turns to think about it, The second idea was rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the holy temple, the back garden of the elders. Richard knows that no matter what he complains and reveals, it is definitely useless. The barbarians will not even listen to him. What was said, if it was a mistake, it was that Richard had thought about all kinds of possible outcomes, but he did not think that in the place of the Holy Temple, the barbaric elders could actually do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to the present, only escape, Richard immediately looked around and prepared to break the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and silently released two senior samurai samurai, one of them said: "Li Cha, you are on the scene, we are going "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and looked at the senior warrior, but said a faint sentence: "The elders are really well arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the face of a sculpted senior warrior look awkward, subconsciously shifting his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from the camp to the temple is not long, but it takes ten minutes. This is also the last buffer opportunity for Richard. While examining the condition of the body, Richard still slowly and steadily descended. Now Richard is only a 17th-level magician. Fortunately, the magical ability is not degraded by the decline of magic, because The erosion of poison and the blood are shrinking. Even the magical world tree that awakens the real name appears to be sluggish. The elemental world tree is falling on the leaves, and signs of degradation begin to appear. Only the blood of Akmon is violent because of nature. Therefore, it is always rolling and roaring, and the black mist formed by the poison collides with each other and consumes each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha tried to use the blood power, although Akmon’s blood was seriously damaged, but he still responded with a roar and was able to use Akmon’s blood. That is, the ability to use the real name of Desmason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard has already wanted to understand at this moment. The elders must have hoped that he would "normally" die in the final battle. On the one hand, he would confess to the Holy Alliance and Su Hailun, on the other hand, he would do it to the mountains and the sea, and other barbarians. The soldiers watched, and afterwards people said it would only say that this was a 'fair' decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sneer at the bottom of his heart. Since they want a ‘fair’ decisive battle, they will give them a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisive battle was held in the battlefield of the Holy Temple. The heads of the nearly 100 barbarian tribes were sitting on the side of the stands, basically the elders of the Presbyterians. At the level of the figure, Li looked at the stands and saw that the Uza Lazu, the big ritual, was sitting there. When I thought about the dark blue, Richard was very respectful and admired for this weird ritual, and even admired it. Some worship, at that time, Richard was still a teenager, and he felt that it was a mountain that could never be crossed for any legendary powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Richard knows that as a great sacrifice to the holy temple, Uzzara can’t know what’s going on behind the scenes, and he’s in his status. It is very likely that it is one of the masters behind the scenes. However, in the stands, Richard could not see the mountains and the sea. He knew that his situation was wrong and the elders could not see the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy footstep in the channel, a dark-skinned, barbaric warrior with a short, stubborn hair on his head went to the duel field and stood up. In front of Richard, he raised the heavy hammer in his hand and said, "My name is Pan Gang. The people in the temple call me bloody. I like the name."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the bloody eyes, and from the inside he saw the naked murderousness, and as he expected, the Presbyterian would definitely find a way to kill him in the first game. In order to avoid night long dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Richard." Richard said, removing the knife from his back and placing it on the ground, then slowly withdrawing the barbaric massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bloody sigh and said, "I heard that you are a magician. Aren't magicians all using the staff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t answer, he didn’t even see blood, his eyes only fell on the barbaric slaughter in his hands. It seemed that he felt the master’s intention, and the blade of the barbaric slaughter was shaking. A beep that can only be heard by Richard, if the sound is heard, it is like a thousand troops fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is doubt in the bloody eyes, but he is also a war-torn warrior. Now he is striding toward Richard. Every step, the momentum will climb one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through, pass, pass, bloody footsteps are like a gloomy drum beat, hitting everyone's heart heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the temple, the elders are heading for their room, an elder of the East Caledon Presbyterian Church is rushing in, as soon as he sees it The elders hurriedly said: "I heard that the battle of the ceremonies has begun. Damn, I have to be late again. Grand elders, don't you go to the battle? This year, the soldiers recommended by the East Caledon Presbyterian Church are very powerful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elder smiled and shook his head and said, "No, I still have something to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The elder looked pity and felt that it might be that the elders could not see this level of fighting, so they bid farewell to the elders and rushed to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders returned to the small room where they worked, and sat down, suddenly felt that there was a kind of fatigue that could not be said, since he entered the legendary realm 100 years ago, There was no feeling of fatigue anymore. He just sighed, the room was ringing, and a confidant elder came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder, the battle between Richard and Bloody has begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elders snorted and asked, "Is that something done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have confirmed that Richard will have all breakfast and water in the morning. Eat it." The elder said, added another sentence: "In fact, even without these means, Richard will not be a bloody opponent, bloody has a strong racial talent, totem strength is not weak, and rich The combat experience..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders interrupted him and said, "You are all right, but this is still safe. If you let the mountains and the sea know, you don’t know what it will be like.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, yes.” The elder said humbly, then remembered, I hurriedly handed over a letter saying, "This is a dispatch from the Holy Alliance Royal Family. This letter is named for you to read it. In addition, they sent a magic message saying that the Alliance Messenger will arrive at the temple within a week. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"Holy Alliance, they sent letters to do this at this time, there has been no contact in the past few decades." The elders frowned, and their hearts had a bad hunch, so they broke open the letter and began to read them carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders counted the time and said: "The bloody battle against Richard should have been finished, you still have to check it out, so important. The ceremonies, you don’t come out very well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders’ face suddenly changed, saying: “Wait, what did you say,.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders sighed and said, "I just...oh, it means bloody should have finished playing for Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The game is over," the elders changed their face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, it’s almost ten minutes, and Li has taken the poison, how can it last for ten minutes." The elder explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders threw down the letter in their hands and flashed out of the room. In the twinkling of an eye, they disappeared at the end of the corridor. The sudden change suddenly happened. The elder was scared. After a jump, I really didn't understand what happened. I didn't know what I said wrong. He suddenly saw the letter paper falling on the ground, and boldly slammed it up and quickly glanced at it. The heart immediately jumped. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is very simple:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Richard ran to you in Calando. The little guy is very important to our Holy Alliance. How important it is to think about it. He used to think that you will 'entertain' him a good meal. I can’t control it, but there are only two requirements. First, the person must come back alive; second, the magic and the ability to construct can not be damaged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above two points, if done, it is Laozi owing you a favor, But if you don't do it... Don't blame Laozi for copying your beasts. I never know what the big picture is. I only know that if there is something wrong with the little guy, you are ready to fill it with the Legion Fortress."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letters on the letter are scribbled, but each stroke has an indescribable taste. The elder is already a legendary realm, and I found this letter. The power of the rules was revealed through handwriting. From this letter, Philip’s injury is mostly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
