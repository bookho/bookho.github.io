			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every aristocrat has proposed an incredible troop increase plan, and those exaggerated numbers are almost out of the nest. Moreover, although the aristocrats present are not too high, but in the pedigree of the kingdom, each family has several channels of communication with the great aristocrats. In their mouths, those who are qualified to live in the kingdom. The names of the great aristocrats began to appear frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Hem is the most joyful of the Dad, not only screaming to evacuate his father’s family, but also to the Duke of Glasgow On the head of the Eagles of the Eagles, he even prepared to let his mother come out to get the King's Guardian Crested Knight out of a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount even swears that if Countess Ekaterina is willing to support his three hundred elite knights, he is willing to sleep with her for a month after the completion of the line plan. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard finally couldn’t help but knock on Him’s head with his fate, which stopped the Viscount’s whimsical plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people seeing at this time are the torrents of gold coins after the success of the line plan, lest the proportion of future points is less. And the larger the army, the easier it is to open the entire bloody area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow their vision, the number of troops dispatched will almost reach the level of the Sequoia Kingdom. If this is really realized, how absurd it is. However, such a ridiculous thing now seems to be more and more likely. In the screams of the nobles, Richard is even known as the new generation of Goddess of the Sequoia Kingdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard himself certainly knows that the ideas of these nobles are simply not feasible. Not to mention that his commanding ability has a ceiling. Now that the commander has been very hard and the scale continues to rise, the commanding effect of Richard will accelerate. In addition, here is the blood-staining place. If a group of nearly 100,000 troops is assembled, the supply pressure will be unprecedented. You don't have to wait until you hit the pale highlands. It is estimated that this army will starve to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last red-eyed aristocrats have not considered the political factors for the time being, and the involvement of the great aristocrats of the kingdom will inevitably lead to the reshuffle of the alliance forces, and the country The war does not say whether the leader will be the little jazz of Richard. First of all, he has to consider the chain reaction of the various human kingdoms bordering the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business path of a nobility alliance and the business path of a kingdom are completely different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped the aristocrats who were over-excited and began to discuss with them the increase in troops. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard has repeatedly raised the standard of additional troops, as long as the veterans of the fourth level or above, or the strong soldiers, and need to be fully equipped, bring their own supplies. It is with such harsh standards that these nobles actually gave Richard a large army of 20,000 troops! In the end, Richard was helpless, forcibly prorating the quota and only accepting the most elite soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Blue Water Oasis to the Cracked Rock Canyon, four battles before and after, Richard spent only ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, for the distribution of this 10,000 warrior quota, the nobility has been arguing for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility arguing for the force distribution plan, Richard began to re-select the soldiers from the reserve army and the strong slaves. After a few battles, his troops also lost a lot. The Shamin cavalry and the barbarians are good fighters. Although there are some problems with loyalty, they are not much worse than those of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grabbing the rare gap, Richard began to sort out his strength so far. On the second day of the war, Richard shut himself in the camp and began to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everything seems to be on the right track, the choices placed before Richard begin to increase, and it’s not just entering the desperate situation when you first entered Faro. But as a result, problems have emerged. Richard must re-plan and sort out what he is doing now in order to increase his strength as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of external strength, Richard’s followers have gradually found their own way, and their strength has gradually taken shape. Since Richard realized that the construction is the essential difference between Noland and Faro, he has elevated the importance of the construction to an unprecedented height. After the water splash, several pieces of the construction that Gangde had done in the end were finally combined into a suit, which also greatly increased his strength. The order of Richard is the most important, and the chasing of the former followers gives priority to the construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dark breath and the wild blows, the splashes and the Gangde have increased their combat power. If the two join hands, the Faro Sanctuary, which is weaker, is also expected to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the entire team was Richard and quicksand. However, Richard's path to his own is still very vague, blood, decoration, magic, top-level combat skills, he has too many choices, it seems that every direction is correct, but it is difficult to decide. The sand is special. She is not worthy of the title of the gods. No matter wisdom, temperament, talents and resources, it is even worse than Richard. The carrying capacity of her own construction is even more surprising. This makes Richard really embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now limited to his own magic level, and can't draw a true third-order structure, it will not wait until he is sixteen. However, the idea that the second-order structure can accommodate can never really bring out the power of the ‘mysterious glory’ designed for sand drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, Richard has only redrawn the first-order magical structure of the flowing sand and upgraded to the second order, and added a spell acceleration to her. Second-order construction. This has improved her strength, but it is not decisive. And the third component, Richard is still adding a spell acceleration, or adding a sway between the 'dark blue segments' that can increase the speed of magic recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue segment was inspired by the blood of the Elf Magic Star, and it was inspired to simulate the characteristics of the magical blood. Due to the ability to simulate the blood vessels that can be realized by the third-order construction in the second-order configuration, this dark blue segment is actually more difficult to draw than the ordinary third-order structure. Its difficulty and life are somewhat similar, mainly because of the complexity and precision, not the level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dark blue fragment is traced back to the source, but it is actually the deep blue sigh from Su Hailun. After becoming a builder, Richard only touched a little bit of deep blue sighs. But if he sees this as a big tree, then the full version of the deep blue sigh is as vast as the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of the followers' ability, Richard is still in a non-interventional attitude, but will tailor them according to their strength and battlefield position. Make some structures to maximize your strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now think of it, Richard feels that his followers seem to have more legal people, and the fierce people who can really rush in the army seem to only There is only one left. The original three-point cooked is more suitable for this job than Gangde, but he died in the hands of the red Cossack killer. Although Richard has already counted the revenge for three points, the red Cossack is still there, and their behind-the-scenes boss Marquis Yang is still there. In the eyes of Richard, this matter is not finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
