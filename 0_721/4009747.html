			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you don’t look up at the miraculous sky, the floating world on the ground is also A magnificent city, wherever it is, has a variety of architectural styles, such as domes, spires, stained glass curtain walls, huge floor-to-ceiling windows, and long and winding external corridors. After passing an intersection, Richard even saw an arcade covering the entire block. The fountains and small squares are dotted with different styles. Every place has its own style, essential decorations, cylinders, railings, stone carvings, broken porcelain or mosaic inlaid murals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city is bathed with a touch of golden light, and it is fixed in the most beautiful evening. Even the pedestrians coming and going on the streets are well-dressed and elegant, and they are in harmony with the style of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears in Richard’s eyes is another perfection, removing awnings, shop tricks, various badges, potted plants, active life, etc. After the human thing. All the urban objects such as buildings, roads, and even fountains and squares, in terms of materials, colors, shapes and styles, reflect a strange precision, harmony, completeness and inseparability. It seems to be one-piece design and construction at the same time. Click to add. For a city of this size, it is a bit unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main road of the city is easy to confirm, that is, the long boulevard that Richard followed Modred along the way, such a long distance stone Except for the difference in the stone pattern of each piece, it is almost exactly the same, as if it was mined from the same larger boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain of the avenue is slightly inclined upwards. The more you walk, the quieter and quieter. The huge canopy of the two sidewalk trees almost obscures all the sky, the branches are drooping, and the strings are hanging. Unripe dark red fruit, wide and thick branches sway in the wind. Richard carefully observed these street trees. Although they could not name them, they could be inferred from the characteristics that they should grow in the wet areas of the south, not the cold and dry plateau in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating stone in the eternal plateau, once stepping into the arch of the stone pillar, seems to be no longer affected by the regional climate, moist and warm all year round, only very Small changes, so you can have such beautiful scenery of the blue trees and the clear stream fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the end of the road, where there is a magnificent temple, divided into seven floors, with six or seven narrower roads than the avenues, from all directions. Extend it and connect it here. The square in front of the temple is full of various vehicles and mounts. The side of the square is the station of the Griffin, the Wyvern and the Moslan Mountain Eagle. Groups of slaves wore robes with family crests and constantly moved heavy goods from the station to move out. Occasionally, you can see hordes of lions landing, and there are often a few nobles wearing gorgeous robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple gate is 12 meters high and 10 meters wide, allowing three large carriages to enter and exit at the same time. Just above the gate, it is an hourglass shaped emblem, which is the mark of eternity and the dragon of time. After entering the temple, there was a hall in front of Richard. The hall had seven exits and a winding path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard went to a smaller side hall with Modred entering the third exit on the left. There are also hundreds of square meters in the side hall, which can park the largest cargo wagon. At the end of it, there is a magical array of transmissions. Two lines of simple and strange magic are squatting beside the magic array. From time to time, a light is emitted from the chest and melted. A small piece of magical metal, then knock it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred pointed to two magical shackles and said, "They are servants of eternal and time dragons. In fact, no one knows where they are from." Come, when the Terran finds and enters the vassal, they already exist. You can see them in every place related to magic in vaude. They will automatically repair the broken magical array, repair the road and the temple, Just like a group of ants or worker bees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
