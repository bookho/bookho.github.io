			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha screamed out the turbidity in his chest and quickly turned the chaotic thinking Pull back to the normal track. After thinking about it for a moment, he said: "If the partner also means a solid alliance, it is a suitable price. But I can't pay so many knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi said: "As your royal architect, you can credit the Earl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"赊?" Richard's face is more eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but must have a clear repayment schedule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the price of the alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such option."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one breath, say: "Real! I choose a partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich now urgently needs strong allies, the identity of the royal architect is not omnipotent, eternal The shelter of the Dragon Temple is only one year. And now this state is only valid in the floating world. Richard is not afraid to leave FS at the moment. Although the appointment with Ellie is more like a transaction, it is not entirely a transaction. He still remembers that Gordon once gave advice to his partner. This condition seems to be tailor-made for Richard, although it is indeed a bit squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A quarter of the down payment, after the Earl received the down payment, the agreement was established." Faschi threw a sentence that made Richard stunned, then Added: "Hurry, maybe there are already other people who are preparing to build the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard once again did not know how to answer The three knights have already finished the matter and returned to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bodies are together, the head is placed separately, do you want to hang up the heads?" Dark theurist Asiris asked gloomyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and said, "No, the bodies are shipped out of the floating island, let their families come back. In addition, inform all the looting sacrifices. The branch family of the product will return the sacrifice within a time limit, otherwise it will be treated as a rebellion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi said: "Do you want to take back the sacrifice? This is not feasible. Well, as far as I know, after they sent the sacrifices out of the floating island, they were forcibly bought by several major forces, and they were almost spared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard smiled and said, "I know. Does the purchase of the sacrifice include the Earl of Ellie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The sacrifice bought by the Earl of the Earl The goods can be returned to you, but there is still a big loss. The count can not get a tenth of the whole." Faschi admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, those sacrifices are given to the Earl, and the partial down payment is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard does not expect to take back the sacrifices in this way. He also knows that most of the sacrifices have been resold, and the purpose of this is to label the mobs with rebellion. In this way, those who have ulterior motives can no longer support them at least in the face, unless they are ready to word out to the parliament and the emperor to explain the interference in the internal affairs of other families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebellion is the most intolerable behavior of every nobleman. Supporting the rebellion of other families can only be carried out in the dark, and must be cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Richard deal with the rebellion-related affairs, Achilles stepped forward and said, "There is nothing else here, I need to go back. Erdong can't support it for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should go back." Semma always has some sleeplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two knights left, Lina said, "I can't go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long Master Li Na saw Richard's expression, could not help but laugh, and then said: "I am guarding the Greenson plane, that is the place that Gordon adults just grabbed from Bear Peter. But there has been a large-scale rebellion there, and I have to deal with it somewhat difficult, so I need help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master did not say what kind of help Instead, looking at Richard with a smile, it seems that he is very interested in what he will react to next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think about it, take her to Gotton’s war room and let her demonstrate the current terrain and situation of the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina is ready to insert a memory spar into the slot of the magic map, then inspire the spar, so the content of the magic sandbox is changed by Noland It became the green face. The magic sandbox shows only a very limited area. The terrain consists of mountains and forests. A river flows out of the mountains, through the forest, and flows into the distance. On the edge of the forest, there is a city mark, while Lina's barracks are located in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city, the emblem of the Bear Peter family is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schumpeter family has been in the Greenson plane for a long time, but the progress has been small, so far only a city-style stronghold has been established. In the battle with the indigenous people in the plane, the loss of the Schumpeter family was quite serious, and the speed of expansion was severely limited. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Gotton entered the Greenson plane, he defeated the Bear Peters defender in a devastating manner, occupied the only city, and then left Lina to be stationed. . However, when Gotton lost his position in the Qiqi plane, when a Lina led the army to sweep the natives, the Xiepide family fighters who had surrendered in the city suddenly launched a rebellion and occupied the city. They are currently unable to defend with the help of three magic towers in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina has been repelled twice in both attacks, and even she has been injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the magic sandbox and thought about it. He is very clear that this is a test of disguise that Long Master Li Na gave him. If you can't solve this problem, then it is difficult to let Lina listen to it in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Master Lina has more than 2,000 troops, no matter the quantity or quality of the rebels. There is only one sanctuary in the rebels, and the confrontation is not the opponent of the Dragon Master. So the difficulty lies in the three magic towers in the city. Under the suppression of the magic tower, Lina's power can only be played half. Another difficulty is that there is no protection from the city, and troops stationed in the forest are often harassed by local forces. Injured warriors have difficulty getting adequate supplies and rest, and the longer they are dragged, the worse the situation will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson Plane, as its name suggests, is full of mountains and forests, with only a small amount of plains and grasslands. The native is a humanoid intelligent creature similar to the Norland elves. It is a headache to come and go in the forest like a wind, good at bows and arrows. Even Lina herself, because of a moment, did not see an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
