In addition, adjust the three hundred knights as a maneuver, and it is necessary to kill Wallace early. Treat the rebels and kill them when they are up!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness!" said Semma respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king is surprised and happy, he naturally knows the strength of the knights and the knights, with their help, Wallace and his Followers of the name of the strong are simply vulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worry is that with strong support, it also carries heavy responsibility. If he can’t catch Wallace again, I’m afraid the throne will Not so secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow I am going to the nest, I don't need you to manage the trip, then I will leave. Ok, that's it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king stepped forward and personally led Richard to the apse. In the palace, there is also a palace dedicated to Richard, even more luxurious than the king’s own residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the palace was built, Richard never came to live. Richard was prepared to turn the palace for other purposes, but was opposed by the followers. This palace represents the dominance of Archimonde and is a symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not talk to the king, and dozens of knights guarded the palace, while Senma took the brigade to the knight to go outside the city. I know what secret things to do. She did not say, even the king did not dare to ask. In the past few years, when Richard was absent, Senma was the queen who ruled the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard began to rest, in the shadow of the palace, yīn slowly opened a pair of eyes. This is a pair of crystal eyes, but there is no reflection in the darkness. Even if someone's eyes pass, they won't see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes silently watched several knights guarded outside the palace and observed the patrol's marching rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, there was a strange and long breathing sound, and there was a vaguely incomprehensible self-speaking inside: "Do you think it is safe to bring so many knights?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When another team of patrolling knights strode past, a black shadow suddenly emerged from the palace. It is like a thin shadow, and it seems to be the illusion of people's night vision. It is almost integrated with the night, and then spreads in the air without interest, and floats to the sleeping hall of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights in the bottom are standing like guns, but they don’t know that a strange yīn shadow is crossing the top of their head and sneaking into the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lights in the palace, and Richard is reading the documents under the lights. Stacked files are flying fast, and most of the files are only counted at a glance, and occasionally they need to look at them more. How many big things can you have in Xiaolan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door suddenly sounded. Richard frowned slightly and said: "I didn't say that there is nothing to stop me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft, sweet voice sounded outside the door:" But I do have very, very important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s face was closed, the documents on his hand were closed, and he said faintly: "Come in." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silently opened, and a young man with beautiful looks is coming in. Although his appearance has completely changed, but Richard is looking at the soul, not the face, now said: "It turned out to be you, Dragon Star. Your courage seems to be bigger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing covered the door and smiled and said: "The size of the courage is to see who it is. Now, I feel that I can be a little bigger. You can't have time to build a knight. Save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee threw the papers on the table, leaned back, and leaned comfortably on the back of the chair, saying, "It seems to be in this palace. If you have someone, you can't catch my whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Xing laughed and said, "I have a lot of people, not just It is in the palace. After all, before I arrived, I am the god here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled sarcastically and said: "Is a junior legend in the district, but also wants to call God? In addition, even if it is a true God, there is nothing remarkable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Star face distortion A moment, then stretched into a metamorphosis smile: "A junior legend, killing you is enough! Your arrogance has succeeded in angering me, I will not kill you soon, ** is an art, a The door is very fascinating art!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not have the horror of Long Xing’s imagination, nor was he calming down, but sitting so peacefully Even without any signs of using magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the threat of Dragon Star has not played any role at all, and it has not scared Richard. This made the Dragon Star soaring and soaring, so that the teeth were so tight that the corners of the mouth were constantly twitching. In the last sentence, he was completely worn out of his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally changed his position, leaned forward, and tapped his hand on the desk, saying: "While you are weaker, you are barely a legend." I am still willing to give you a chance to work for me, how? Otherwise, you are a dead end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far!!" Shouting hysterically, the maximum volume was used, so that there was a break. He pointed his finger at Richard's nose, and his body was shaking. The screaming sound slammed over Richard's eardrum over and over again: "What makes you so arrogant!? What? I can take you whenever I want. Split into hundreds of pieces, thousands of pieces! Is Senma here, can't stop me! But you actually said let me work for you, ha, haha! Let a great legend work for you? Why don't you find a few True God, say to them, 'Come! Work for me! Otherwise you are dead!', ah? Why not?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing’s neck is swollen Red, the eyes are covered with bloodshot eyes, and the forehead is sweating, it is already on the verge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at him with interest and said: "There are really some real gods working for me. There are also people who refuse to work. Dead end. But look at your appearance, this time should be very bad, probably always afraid that I will find the mouse hole you are hiding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to hell!" The dragon's hand flashed in the cold, and suddenly there were two jagged daggers, and they stung to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sat still, but raised the unsheathed moonlight and held the stabbing dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing’s eyes suddenly widened, and all of them were in vain, and the trembling said: “You...how do you have such great power! This is impossible, it is impossible!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing only feels that he is stabbing on a mountain, as a legend known for his speed, he Of course, it does not move the mountain. However, the impact of the all-out effort did not allow Richard to move the points, not at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon star suddenly killed a pull, but the dagger also did not move! The force of the violent shock in an instant caused his face to suddenly rise to blood red, and a blood had reached the throat, but it could not be sprayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his wrist and sank twice, and the dragon's eyes shattered immediately. The impact of Juli made another blood in his abdomen, but it was stuck in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaan can't sit still, the moonlight scabbard turns, and gently in the chest of Longxing! Just listening to the muffled sound, the dragon star suddenly appeared a horrible hollow in the chest, a group of blood fog appeared behind him, the thoroughly smashed internal organs mixed with blood spouted, dyed the big half of the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a knock, and Richard almost shattered the entire upper body of the Dragon Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recovered the moonlight and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the dragon star is full of fear, squatting back, and the back hits the wall heavily. He reached out to Richard and pleaded: "No! Don't kill me! I promise you, I will work for you! I will be faithful, you also need legends, right?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and raised his left hand and said, "Are you promised? Unfortunately, I lied to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There are several light strips flying out of Richard's left hand, flying around the dragon star quickly, immersed in his body without any hindrance, then pulling out, immediately pulling a transparent figure from the dragon star body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the restraint of the light belt, the transparent figure is extremely painfully nicknamed, and in a blink of an eye it is compressed into a fist-sized ball of light, falling in Richard Hands. The expression of the dragon star began to stagnate at this moment, and the breathing gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
