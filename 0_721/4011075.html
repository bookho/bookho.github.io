			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and asked: "What are the conditions for entering the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Crap!" The voice of the youth suddenly increased, pointing hard at the foot and shouting: "In this place, I am the boss! I will not let you into the city, you have to give me out the order of light curtain! Now I looked at the thing behind you, handed it over, and then went to work under my hand, satisfied me with the wait, maybe you can put you into the city. Otherwise, you will rotten outside the wasteland. Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the screams of the youth, several people around the original city gate were not close to Richard, and surrounded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t seem to see these people, just looking at the young people and saying, “What if I disagree?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly screamed behind him: "Then you will die!!" Then the wind rang and a heavy wooden stick slammed into Richard's back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stick is quite powerful, and it is very hot and accurate. The guy who shot is obviously not weak, and the stick has actually attached some vindictiveness! This stick is sturdy. If it is an ordinary person, most of the brain will be smashed, and it will be lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brawny man named White Bear changed his face and made a gesture he wanted to block, but it was obviously late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a twinkling of light flashing in front of everyone! The stick didn't fall on Richard's back, but suddenly turned into two, and the first half flew directly into the sky. The sulky inferno with the sullen sorrow also looked at his arms gradually from the body, then his head suddenly fell from the body, fell to the ground, and rolled out far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked at the rolling head and seemed to be scared for a moment, and did not react at all. After a while he suddenly screamed: "Boss!" The face was pale. He wanted to put the leg across the intersection, but found that he couldn't get it back, because Richard's left hand had already held his ankle, and the moonlight of his right hand fell like a rainbow, passing through the roots of his thigh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man made an earth-shattering scream, he did not feel the pain, but screamed because of extreme fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard threw the young man's thighs on the ground and looked back at the few people who were completely shocked. The guys suddenly burst into a scream and suddenly fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go after the escape, but the backhand took the moonlight into the knife and continued to walk into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Bear sighed and said, "Are you going to leave like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I stopped and looked at him indifferently and said, "Why, are you with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Bear smiles: "Of course not! Hey!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White bear sighed, walked to the young man who was sorely rolling around, held him down, and then simply put a dagger into the youth The heart, also stirred a bit. This move shows that Richard has slightly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard’s expression, the white bear stood up and said calmly: “You cut a leg and it’s no different from killing him. And here’s In order to keep the meat delicious, people will cut the meat as much as possible while he is alive. You understand that this will be a very painful process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But it may be very enjoyable," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear’s face flashed in surprise, looking at Richard’s eyes full of jealousy, slowly saying: “You are not new. You come from Where?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I did just arrive in the dark area soon. But it was near a small town.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear has even some fear on his face. He stepped back two steps and opened a distance with Richard. He said, "The town? All the towns are very far from here. You mean, you crossed the entire wasteland." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Not the entire wasteland, but it has been going for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How long?" White Bear asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I will tell you? Time is the core secret in this place." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear hesitated and glanced at Richard's knife and asked, "Is that space equipment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard admitted Anyway, this is not a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear took a deep breath and said, "You are very powerful, much more powerful than I thought. But I advise you not to do too much. Excessive things, we have very powerful people here, and they have lived in this city for a long time. Come with me, I will take you to a place, maybe you can help us deal with those things in the future." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught up with the white bear and asked quietly: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I can't describe it, you will know when you see them. I only know that they may be the aborigines of this damn place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal! ? Richard’s heart glimpsed, and he did not expect that there would be news of the aborigines so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear came to a small and dilapidated courtyard with Richard, pushed the door open, and went in first, then said to Richard: "Come in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went into the courtyard and saw that the small courtyard was better than the building in the town, but it was also very simple. Those stones that are slightly neat are even tables and chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the courtyard, sitting on a skinny old man, he is using the branches to keep some quirky symbols on the ground. When Richard came in, the old man suddenly looked up and his eyes were empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man, though he has lost his eyes, looks at Richard like a normal person, then reveals a creepy smile and says, "You are finally here." I have been waiting for you for three thousand years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the war in heaven is going on in full swing, and fighting takes place in every corner of the vast world. Every moment, countless Heavenly Warriors fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens are a special world, and every life here comes from the origin of light. When they die, from the body to the soul will turn into light, return to the origin of light, and then I do not know how long it will reappear in the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly emerging people of heaven are certainly no longer dead, but every true heavenly person will regard death as the end of a cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one source of light in heaven, and there is only one faith. According to common sense, there should be no war between the people of the heavens. In the hundreds of thousands of years that have passed, the swords of the endless warriors of the heavens are pointing to the opposite side. But this time, I don’t know why, the interpretation of the origin of light in the heavens is suddenly divided into two factions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views of the two factions are similar, but because of the subtle differences, it has led to this war that has spread throughout the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of heaven are pure, and there is no difference in their beliefs. In their eyes, faith has no room for compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the heavenly warriors who have killed countless lives and deaths, there is a different kind, St. Martin. St. Martin, who entered the heavens from the lower bound, will not return to the origin of light after death like other heavenly warriors, and then resurrected in another form after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin is dead, it is really dead, even the body with the soul will completely dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like Martin are not unique. Both sides of the war in the heavens have a lot of people who come to the heavens from the lower bounds, and they all come for the sake of faith. Even in the eyes of the people of heaven, these guys are a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Martin is doing a crazy thing, he is asking his soldiers to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war in heaven has been going on for a long time, during which time Richard has won the reapers and the high elves of the Green World, and even succeeded. Go to the deepest part of the world and cross the battlefield of eternal bloody battles. It was only at the last minute that in order to escape the unrivaled sword of the man on the throne, he had to break into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this war, Martin miraculously survived one battle after another. Although his camp is at a disadvantage, his enthusiasm for fighting is as blazing as when he first arrived in heaven. As the war progressed, Martin has now become a lower-level commander, commanding 30 true heavenly people to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
