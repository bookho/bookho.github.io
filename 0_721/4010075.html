			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All!?" Vulture's face changed slightly. This is thirty years of life! In the past years, she has seen more elderly people who are going to be in the woods. For the sake of one or two years of life, the means are all out, and they are not afraid to wave the knife to their relatives. At the end of life, even an extra life of one year is invaluable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for thousands of years, the sacrifices are as many as the river, but it is recognized that extra life is the first grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, can you assign God's grace to the past? What if you don't have this option?" Richard raised his own concerns. The randomness of God's gift is the sign of Eternal and the Dragon of Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that there must be this option. I have been a big priest for so many years, this little privilege is still there." Vatican is obviously very Happy, actually blinked, with some playful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will wait." After Richard finished, Vatican let him leave the quiet room and go to the front hall to wait for the beginning of the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the quiet room, Vatican’s palms morphed into a pale gold hourglass, which was gently knocked out, and a silent wave was transmitted far away. After a while, the sand came into the quiet room and said to Vatican: "You call me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit, now there is still a little time from the sacrifice." Vatican gestured, and the sand was sitting on the original position of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Vatican has long disappeared from the joy of talking with Richard, but a serious and dignified, solemnly said: "Sand sand, you regret it still "There is time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already decided." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it necessary? Your soul is a eternal and timeless dragon. This time you leave the Dragon Hall and go to the Faro plane to pay a lot of God. Well, where are you still have so much grace?” Vatican’s tone is already very strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can borrow from the Eternal and Time Dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was dull Mouth irritated, Vatican's double eyebrows gradually turned up, actually revealed the murderous! She said with amazement: "There is a lot of grace you owe now! Then borrow, what do you want to return? I can tell you that if you borrow God's grace this time, you will not be able to survive this life! You know I don't know, how much is it to be repaid by the title? Three times! You don't want to be with Richard. If you are willful, then you will end up with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand-splitting eyes trembled, apparently Vatican also said her heart. She sighed and said, "I know, but... I have a feeling that if he doesn't go with him this time, he will probably not come back. Faro is a legendary plane."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican silently, then sighed softly and said softly: "Since you have made up your mind, then I will give you the last two advices. If you never refuse If you listen, then even if you go to Faro, Richard may stay there forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is shaking and he begins to listen carefully. As the great priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall, Vatican has a pair of eyes that can see the future, although the cost of using this ability is enormous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican indulged in a sacred and solemn manner: "First of all, you have to let Richard make his own decisions, and you can't use the ability to spy on the future to help him. This will only harm him. You know, the river of time. The rogue track is not a change of one or two small waves. So you have to learn to accept the major decisions of Richard. What you should do is to accept. For example, this sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands solemnly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "The second thing is a trivial matter. There is a question about you saying that Richard may have some lack of confidence, I have found a solution. But I have contacted him several times on this occasion. I haven’t seen how confident he is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting the sand and chuckling: “Excessive confidence is actually a lack of confidence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "Well, after the sacrifice is over, you hand over to Richard."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin handed to the sand is three shining crystal clear three crystal slate, each piece is only the size of the palm, crystal clear, the front is engraved with the emblem of the eternal and time dragon, the opposite is the Vatican Personal seal. The power of time flows through the crystal slate slabs, like a cluster of light golden flying sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is sand, it is not clear about the use of these three crystal slate, so ask: "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the three magical instruments that let Richard close to the body. In the future, if you encounter any problem that cannot be solved, you can break one, and all the problems can be solved. A slate can save him three lives." Vatican said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the flowing sand became very weird, and the eyes stared at Vatican without hesitation. She really doesn't believe in Vatican's words. How can there be such a thing in the world? This even goes beyond the scope of artifacts. Even God can't boast that it can solve all problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that it is Vatican's private system, that is, it is difficult to find God's grace with similar effects from the grace of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. The grace of the prophecy is more precious than the grace of time. Even if there is, there is no possibility of such a horror effect. This is an unmistakable miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands endured and endured, and finally decided to use the way to remind Vatican: "The curiosity is very strong, before going to the Faro plane, definitely I will use two crystal slate to try out the effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know!" Vatican replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand only feels extremely big, but the bell in the temple rings, and the time for the sacrifice is over, she must rush to preside over the sacrifice. She reluctantly put the crystal slate into her arms, or decided to do it according to what Vatican said. Vatican’s great priest, at least it’s impossible to have nothing to do with them, and it won’t hurt them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second sacrifice, and Richard is familiar with the program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time accompanying him into the ruins of the central ruins is not the Vatican, but the sand. The head of the huge star beast was behind him, and after the blessing of the power of the magical bull, the power of the gods, and the igniting of the blood, Richard finally put the big guy who had a few tons of weight. I got to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrificial ritual begins in a familiar prayer, using the prayers dedicated to the highest level of ritual. The power of time constantly rushed out of her body, turning into a strip of amber color, which inspired the altar. The curtain of time rose again, surrounded by Richard, while blocking the flow of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the curtain of time, it is a world in which time and space are independent. This is to prevent the sacrificial process from being disturbed, that is, the priest of the eternal dragon temple does not work either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starburst head on the altar is gradually extracted from power, turned into a force of time, integrated into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People, according to your wishes, God is already in front of you, choose!" The voice from the void is sacred, grand and mechanical. It’s just a glimpse of the eternal and timeless dragons left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, a large group of time power gathered together, from the inside faintly emerged a very magnificent giant door pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s hand touched the grace, a message immediately appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Take a leisurely stroll, you can use God's grace to increase the level of the plane channel connected to the specified plane. Richard immediately chose the Faro plane, and assigned the time of grace for about twenty years, engraving the plane number on the pillar of time and space of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has more than half of the remaining, so the new option reappears. Except for Richard's expectation, in front of him, launched a full two pages, up to nearly one hundred grace options! This can be completely different from previous experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately browsed through all the options, and did not dare to let go of even a descriptive word, for fear of missing the way that Vatican said that God would be assigned The option to give sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I saw the first grace option, Richard almost lost his calmness immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Ability to give. You will learn the skills associated with your abilities in the back-to-back time, and reach the level of mastery, which is equivalent to becoming a student who has mastered the skills and has experienced ten years of hard work. The effect of learning will be determined by your own wisdom. When this grace appears, it can be repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real shock to Richard is the ability to learn under the 'Capabilities': The final version of the Twilight Knight series (available from six pieces) Randomly learn two pieces); Final version of Magic Magic Set series (three pieces can be randomly learned from five pieces); Armed Forces of Heaven (can learn one randomly from five pieces); learn to build 'Srepp' Foot' (one of the 'Prison Warlord' suits); learn to construct 'tangled', (one of the 'Twisted Dreams' suit);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx. The grace of the year, you can choose God's grace: ability to give one time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the remaining thirty years of grace can make Richard learn the famous magic set of Noland! Although learning does not mean that it can be done, but when Richard's ability to meet the requirements is met, he can immediately make this set of sets that are currently in existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed this opportunity, who knows how long it will take before I can see this grace again. Greater possibility, no, 99.999% probability, it is impossible to see this grace again. Richard, who has deep knowledge of magical mathematics, is very clear. Such a probability is equal to never being possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know that my perseverance is so big, I can look at the second option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of moving his eyes, a voice constantly screamed in the heart of Richard: "Learn more of the structure, you can get more powerful power, It means more sacrifices! You can distribute more gods to the sand in the future. Isn't this a better ending? It's just a small decision, but it can change the fate, think about it, complete. The magic set! Even you can learn the Twilight Knight and then fill the two pieces behind yourself. It's a very simple thing, isn't it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
