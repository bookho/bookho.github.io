			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde and the three-pointed mutual look at each other, without a word, stand Jump into the array of dwarf gunners and start killing. The four killings began to take off, the barbarian of the brigade was still not close, and the dwarf gunner was cut down most of the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked, this is something he could not have expected. In the face of the average level, the Dwarf Musketeer who had no time to load ammunition at level 5, he The lethality of the four entourages is too great, except that the twilight is one by one, and the other three are harvesting life in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave a few live!!" Richard quickly introduced a command in consciousness, and had to scream and let them converge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed the accident of the Dwarf Musketeer, the team's great magician was bombarded by Richard, the cavalry team's main force was annihilated, and the Cossack caravan entered the doomsday. The next one is the one-sided slaughter. As for the captain of the Guards Cavalry, who was originally a 14th-level powerhouse, he was killed by Gangde, two ogres, Sandron and Shuihua in the moment of confrontation. They have been fighting side by side for a long time, and they have a tacit understanding of each other. After the battle with Sinclair, they have more experience in harvesting the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over soon, the escorts and personnel of the caravan have chosen to surrender, and those who resist are killed. Richard’s army has always been devastating, and they have fewer wounded soldiers and more deaths. For example, the dwarf firearmsman, Richard called it has been timely, but in the end there are ten live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the horse walked around the battlefield and took care of the situation, and began to continue to order: "Check the goods on the truck, Search the captives and treat the wounded soldiers! In addition, bring all the dwarves to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten dwarf firemen were pulled in front of Richard, each There are large pieces of bruising on his face. The dwarf's temper is stinky and hard, and he is captured and not honest. He keeps muttering in his mouth. The sandmen’s cavalry, who naturally escorted them, would not be polite. After a punch and kick, they finally let them settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you from? Where are you coming from? Why is it in the red Cossack caravan?" Richard said in his general language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf said something, but it was not a lingua franca, and Richard could not understand it. He immediately cast a spell that was fluent in his own language, and then listened hard for a long time before he realized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves are from the pale highlands of the northwest of the blood-stained land. It is one of the largest dark worlds on the continent. In the depths of the highlands are the kingdoms of various aliens, and they come from the anvil of one of the dwarf tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunder's Anvil Tribe and a red Cossacks in the pale highlands have occasionally come into contact, eventually in spirits, coins and all kinds of luxury The product fell under the offensive, selling various raw ore to the red Cossack, and also provided a team of firemen as mercenaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard frowns, Noland's dwarves are also a big race, they also make and use muskets, but the power is far less than the current firearms. The lethality of their volley just now is even more terrifying than throwing a soldier. To know that the throwing soldiers are eight-level fighters, the same number of ordinary archers are far from being able to compare with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly flashed a flash of light and said to the guards around him, "Show me their muskets."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
