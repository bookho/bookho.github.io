			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the Viscount of Heim, Richard wrote a few letters that night. Letter, then let a few clever and smart men send to Lanshui Oasis and Deep Rock City respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the letters was given to Sir Shandon, and he was asked to bring the magic crystal worth 50,000 gold coins when he escorted the next batch of supplies. The money can buy about one hundred magic crystals on the market, and the channel of Sir Shandon can finally get one hundred and twenty standard units of magic crystal. With this magic crystal, Richard can develop three additional fourth-order capabilities for the nest, or raise the level of the nest to fifth, and get a new fifth-order ability. With the fifth-order mother's nest, you can create a combat unit with the highest level equivalent to ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other letters were written to Tiffman, Amman and Billier of the Blue Water Oasis. Richard needs to order a new batch of barbarians and sand people slaves from Tiffman. Most of the soldiers now have redeemed their freedom. The free barbarian warrior only feels the love of Richard, and stays behind when others are in short supply. But after a long time, they will leave Richard and return to their hometown. The brutal love of the barbarians has always been the content of many epic sings on the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Amman, Richard hopes to get an alliance agreement and try to hire a team of elite swordsmen. The sanctuary swordsman Luofu is not only famous for his sword skills, but also his ability to train the army. Finally, Richard hopes to order a batch of refined carbon steel and Lafite iron from Billier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the supplies are in place, all the money in the hands of Richard will be squandered, even including the defective parts that have not yet been sold. But what is exchanged for being poor is the unprecedented strength of the military! What Richard’s current actions can’t be described by the arrogance of the soldiers is completely desperate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the most powerful army in the shortest possible time is obviously not for defense. Richard has turned himself into a complete war trafficker, ready to use iron and blood to extract what he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t tell why he suddenly lost patience and became so impatient. In fact, Richard is very clear about what it is because he is not willing to admit it. When I thought of Su Hailun, I thought of the dark blue, and when I thought of the mountains and the sea, he would never be calm. Wisdom and real talents bring Richard more than just a solution. In fact, there is also a subtle influence on the mood. When Richard felt that everything was in control, when he felt that all the variables were within expectations, the fluctuations in emotions became smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, in many cases, is synonymous with indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time spent in Faro’s plane has been long enough, and Richard has almost forgotten everything in Noland. However, now I think of it again, re-thinking the three promises I have made, and finally feel that a fire in my chest is burning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to go beyond the limits of the plane to complete the deep blue sigh; he wants to defeat all Archimonde, so that the mother's name will always be engraved on the top of the volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about mountains and sea? For every act that is full of domineering girls, does he have a promise? Richard did not remember that she had made any promises to her, but felt that she had to go to a wild continent to see her once. As for what happens after the meeting, even the gods cannot predict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard was restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is long, and the sky is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard who stayed up all night were covered with bloodshot eyes, and almost all of them were surrounded by topography, power and mineral distribution. Thinking always has results, and Richard now feels that his grasp of the situation is much clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following week was spent in peace, but the situation was surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expected, when the Count of Heim left, Baron Xiaofang Dan became more and more tough on Richard. Perhaps this is not the original intention of the Little Baron, but the reality is that a batch of materials ordered by Richard from Deep Rock City was stolen and robbed while passing through the baron of Fang Dan. The truck fleet was completely annihilated, and everyone was killed without leaving a living. The goods are naturally missing. Although the shipment was just a small iron ingot, there were more than a dozen blacksmiths hired in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has been paying attention to the movement of the Baron, and in just one week, the defense of the Baron’s collar has been greatly enhanced, a team of 300 people. The Sphinx Swordsman stationed in the Baron’s territory and was stationed in the Barracks Fortress outside the Castle at dusk. Some people with a little common sense know that these average level six swordsmen are the private army of Count Canglu. On the issue of protecting the new vassal, Count Canglu was very active. Now who wants to attack the dusk castle, it is no different from playing directly with the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the rebellion of Baron Xiaofang Dan, the Duke of the Wolf, who had always been strong, expressed unremarkable silence. This means that the power of the Duke of the Wolf is not strong enough to determine the situation. He is at most politically restrained by the Duke of Glasgow. After all, it is impossible to fight the two lines. The Principality of White Rock is a behemoth that is even stronger than the Duke of Glasgow, and there is no sure victory for the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Privately, Sir Richard Rinden instructed Richard to act at will, but the subtext was that Richard had to bear the consequences himself, at least for the most part. The Duke of the Wolf is launching an offensive against the Principality of White Rock. The dragon that wants to be robbed actually has little effect on him. Richard has already guessed that the Duke is preparing to use the Dragonfly as a sacrifice. Palin’s importance to the Duke is self-evident, and nature is much more important than Richard’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And although Sir Shandon did not mention it from beginning to end, Richard also guessed that the Duke of the Wolf had received enough compensation on the issue of Baron Fontaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, Richard needs to face the pressure of the Him family alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistance provided by the Duke was the swordsman of that battalion, returning to Deep Rock City in order to protect Richard and the quicksand. As long as the two of them do not die, an altar can be established, and the duke can rely on his own strength to complete the sacrifice. However, the Duke of the Wolf arranged this power and clearly explained his views on the follow-up development. For Richard, once he used the swordsman battalion, he completely lost his independent position with the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bad news, and good news is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allies in the Blue Water Oasis are more secure than you think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tifman sent more than fifty barbarian warriors and three hundred sandmen slaves to Richard. Billier also transported the metal that Richard needed, and gave away an extra ten handles and five hundred arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Amman, it provides a covenant for hiring, and if Richard can help the Louvre Swordsman to defeat enemies around the Blue Water Oasis, then Richard may get A seat in the Blue Water Oasis. There are more than 500 warriors who are poisonous, Miqila, which is the first goal. Amman opened the purchase price of twenty gold coins for each of the drug dealers. The poisonous Mickey's own brain is worth an extra ten magic crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
