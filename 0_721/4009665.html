After a long winter, people can finally start a new year without having to endure the cold, the food is easier to get, and the variety is also Gradually become rich. So when winter comes to spring, it is the most important festival of the year. Not only humans, dwarves, orcs, elves and even ogres put the most important celebrations in spring. Of course, the world is so complicated, there will always be exceptions. For example, the residents of the underground world, spring has little meaning to them. Exceptions can go to extremes, such as the snow demon, the most hated of this race is spring. In any case, for most humans, spring is always enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the warm and humid airflow climbed over the coastal mountains and reached the village of Rutherland, the villagers knew that spring was here again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rutherland is located at the foot of the Coastal Mountains, a small, inconspicuous spot in this vast stretch of mountains, and tens of thousands of humans. One of the settlements. It is part of the Baron Tucker and is also the territory of the Holy Alliance. However, even in terms of straight-line distance, the castle of Baron Tucker is nearly three hundred kilometers away. Only in the autumn harvest, the village people will see the baron’s tax official. Only at this time, the lord has a negligible sense of existence. The baron’s tax is very light, just to collect some local products that are unique to the mountains, and have little influence on the daily life of the villagers. However, the output of the village is limited. If the taxation influence is larger, it will involve survival problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life in the mountains is actually not too difficult, as long as one year of hard work is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When spring arrives, the land outside the village needs to be ploughed, sowing the food that can be harvested in the summer. The hunters began to enter the forest. At this time, those who were hungry for a winter in the depths of the forest gradually woke up and began to forage. They become very dangerous and extremely aggressive. But some of the specialties of Warcraft, such as some glands that can be used as precious herbs or spices, can only sell the highest price if they are the best at this time. Every year in this season, hunters will have death and injury, but every year hunters will enter the mountains as usual. So in the village of Rutherland, the forest and the goddess of hunting get the most faith. It is important to know that in addition to the dragon of eternal life, the gods and beliefs on the continent of Noland are like stars above the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland is a land of fertile land, a land of strength, and a land of strict hierarchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a remote and peaceful village like Rutherland, it is deeply imprinted with the brand. The villagers are honest and sincere, but they also respect the strong and despise the weak. There are only a few dozen small villages, but they also have hidden levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small figure outside the village. It was a boy with a basket of his own height on his back, filled with breadfruit. In the spring, the reserves of a winter have been basically exhausted, and when the new crops have not yet been harvested, the fruit that is not so good is a very important ration. It's easy to get, just go to the woods next to the village and you'll be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the little boy, three teenagers appeared to be taller than him. They held a short bow on their bows, a short knife in their waists, and prey with deer and rabbits behind them. Although they are less than ten years old, they can also go hunting in the mountains. Their prey is certainly not Warcraft, but some tame animals. The way to hunt is mainly based on traps, but this is not easy. Civilians and aristocratic children in the town, this time most of them are still learning and practicing under the wings of their parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed teenager suddenly shouted: "Hey, Richard, your father? Didn't he teach you to hunt? I am at your age, but I have already set a trap in the mountains to catch rabbits!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy next to him smiled and said, "No child will only lick the fruit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three big boys laughed, crossed the little boy, ran to the village, walked easily, and did not see that everyone had mentioned dozens of kilograms of prey. The little boy ignored the ridicule, but continued to carry his own basket to the village. A middle-aged man sitting in the mouth of the village saw everything in sight. He waved to the little boy, called it, and then stuffed a dried Warcraft meat in the boy's hand. His head, asked: "Small Richard, Piru, they bully you like this, are you not angry? Go back to the uncle to teach them a meal, even if it is a child, you can't talk too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect the little boy to shake his head and say, “No, I am not angry.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But...” The man grabbed his hair with a rough black hand, which was difficult to understand. He thought he was afraid of the big boys and couldn't help but want to say a few words. Children in the mountains can be short of anything, that is, they cannot lack courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which know the little boy smiled and said: "I don't have a father, but I have a best mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man listened to this sentence, can only continue to hold his head, smiled and said: "That is, that is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The little boy sang songs, carrying big baskets, and jumping to the village. At this time, the little haze of Xiao Li’s heart had already been swept away and he became happy again. Because my mother told him to make himself happy whenever he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Xiao Li was six years old. At the age of six, he learned to be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is named Bobby, he is a blacksmith in the village, and the boy’s mother is said to be a magic apprentice. When she came to Rutherland Village alone, the little Richard in her arms was still in her arms. It is a woman whose appearance is not very beautiful, but it is as warm as water. Her arrival brought a new atmosphere to the small Rutherland Village. For the first time in the village, there was a doctor who didn’t have to go to the town dozens of kilometers away for a little illness or pain, or simply endure Wait for it to heal naturally. Her name is Elaine, and she opened a small pharmacy at the edge of the village. Although she could only make the first-level pharmacy, she saved more than one villager's life in the first year. Therefore, the village chief and the elders decided to give Yilian a piece of land and officially accepted her as a member of Rutherland. Among the small Rutherland villages, the most are hunters. There are only three professionals, that is, blacksmiths, Yilian, who is also a doctor, and the head of the retired sergeant. These three people supported the operation of the entire village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life in Rutherland Village is calm and slow, time is passing unconsciously, and in the twinkling of an eye, it is a new spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Richard has grown a dozen centimeters tall and looks like a child of eight-nine-year-old. According to the tradition of Rutherland Village, he should have learned to make and lay traps, to hunt rabbits and other grass-eating little Warcraft. In the woods not far from Rutherland Village, there are many such small Warcraft, and the large Warcraft is almost invisible. That is the reserve for the children in the village. Hunters never hunt small animals there, but they patrol regularly to clean up the dangerous big Warcraft that occasionally breaks into the woods. However, every few days, Xiao Licha will still carry the basket up the mountain. The basket on the back looks like the proportion is not so bad, but it shows that he is still licking the fruit. The breadfruit is not delicious, the mountains are everywhere, and the people in the village prefer the delicious Warcraft meat. Even if you don't consider the taste, you can eat long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard still wants to start the age of hunting, this is the mother's request. More than that, he has to collect herbs by the way, four in each season, and then follow the established and complicated process. Half of the process is done while the herbs are being taken, while the other half is done after going home. What he didn't understand was that the breadfruit had to be treated similarly, and the process and time were much more. No one in the village has ever done this. Breadfruit is the easiest food to get. After ripening, it will fall naturally one night, and you can directly enter it when you pick it up. However, the mother asked that the breadfruit could not be fallen to the ground, but it should be picked from the trunk. The size and color of the selection had fixed requirements, and the picking technique was special. Richard did not understand why, and did not feel the difference in the taste of the breadfruit brought back by the special method, but as long as he did not pick the breadfruit as required, it would be picked out by the mother. After several reprimands, Xiao Licha did not play tricks any more, but seriously, and made every tedious step. It was not until the winter that the breadfruit could not be picked up, and the mother told him that it was to give him perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Xiao Li is seven years old. At the age of seven, he remembered to be persevering in doing things. To say that there is something unpleasant in the memory of seven years old, that is, every dinner is breadfruit. This little thing eventually became one of the nightmare that he couldn’t miss in his childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new spring is coming, Rutherland Village is still the same. The blacksmith Bobby is still single, and Elaine's pharmacy business has not improved. The village chief is still strong, and every time there is an intractable Warcraft, it is at the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha can finally learn to set a trap. At this time, Piru they have begun to pick up short bows and follow the village hunters into the mountains. Crossing the threshold of ten years old, they can already be called teenagers, and the tall and straight figure is placed in the city, which makes people mistakenly think that it is the age of fifteen or six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing traps is a matter of learning, requires a wealth of experience, a pair of good-looking eyes, a pair of dexterous hands and a certain amount of luck. In the case of simple tools, in addition to experienced hunters, novices are likely to hurt themselves when making traps. Xiao Licha was very talented in learning. For the first time, he showed the advantage of overwhelming the same village teenagers, and the traps laid on the first day were very successful and praised by the adults in the whole village. The blacksmith Bobby said that everyone is happy, as if Richard is his own son. However, almost everyone in his mind knows that if Richard can call him a father, it is estimated that Bobby will be willing to shut down the blacksmith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days have passed, and Richard has mastered several traps. He began to enter the depths of the reserve and set up several large compound traps. Here, there are occasional large-scale Warcraft haunts, he wants to try his luck. Richard had a good luck, a Kamchatka wild boar appeared in the field of vision and ran into a trap. The animal clip assembled from thorns, rattan and nails firmly grips its front legs. Although the wild boar is very powerful, Richard's traps work fine, and the balance of power in all aspects is handled very well. After a crazy pull and shaking, he still has not been freed from it. Richard, who was hiding on one side, was nervous and sweaty. The hunting knife held in his hand was not so reliable for the first time. The injured wild boar is very dangerous. Although the Kamchatka wild boar is small and courageous, he is only a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Richard determined that the prey couldn’t break free and was ready to rush out, suddenly there was a strong force behind him, pushing him out. Richard fell heavily on the ground and only felt a whirlwind, and he had a sigh of relief in his mouth and nose. He heard a bowstring, then the screams of the wild boar. A few cheers rang and the sound was very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly climbed up and saw Piru with three teenagers who didn’t know when it appeared, just one of the teenagers pushed him Go out. Piru held the hunting bow in his hand and was looking at the poor Kamchatka wild boar. An arrow is inserted in the neck of the wild boar. It's not easy to shoot at a single arrow, but it's not the same as being trapped by a trap. The wild boar has been snarling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You grab my prey!" Richard suddenly understood what they were doing and cried angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people here can prove that this wild boar was shot by me. How to grab it? Just because you have a trap, good hunters know, This kind of trap is only used to catch rabbits." Piru said slowly, looking at Richard with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is nearly a head taller than Richard, and his body is obviously strong. And his strength is actually bigger than his peers, almost as much as an adult. This is because Piru is the son of the village chief. The head of the retired sergeant can often hunt some powerful Warcraft from the mountains. This kind of Warcraft meat is good for the strong body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how come you come here to shoot wild boars?" Richard asked a question to let Piru. They looked down on Richard's thinness, but they had to admit that Richard was really smart. It is said that he would write a lot of words. However, these young Piru have not respected Richard, can write and can not be used for hunting, do you know so many words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s counter-inquiry made Piru feel very annoyed. He waved his hand and a teenager walked around behind Richard and took Richard Push on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha climbed up, his face rose red, his hand gripped the hunting knife tightly, and the momentary burst of momentum gave the teenager an inexplicable feeling. To a deep chill! The hunting knife was finally pulled out. As soon as he was hesitant, Piru had already slammed his stomach. The teenagers swarmed up and snatched the hunting knife, and then the punching and kicking. Piru stepped on Li's head and drove his face deep into the dirt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strengths in the young bones in the mountains. This fight is not light. Richard did not struggle to resist, nor pleaded for mercy, but silently endured. Piru is more angry and more and more heavy, and he feels contemptuous from Richard’s silent reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not satisfied? Not convinced?" The teenagers are getting more and more forceful. Richard is like the body is not his own, just let them be beaten. It didn't take long for Piru to be afraid. He was afraid that he would seriously hurt Richard, and he would definitely have to fight a good fight when he returned home. The temper of the village chief is as hot as his strength, and the reputation of Yilian in the village has always been very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenagers gradually stopped, and it took a while for Richard to get up. Piru dropped a few words, and he took the wild boar and went. When they walked away completely, Xiao Lichao fell down under the tree. After a long break, he struggled to stand up and walked home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Elaine looked at the little Richard, who was covered with bruises, and the tears flowed out of disappointment. Instead, the boy comforted her and said nothing, just A little pain. After taking the medicine, the boy looked at his mother and asked, "Can't you still fight back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Elaine bit his teeth and pressed hard. nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I won't fight back, but I won't give in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the down day, Piru found Richard a few more troubles, and the process was nothing more than a beating. But the heaviest one, until all the people were tired, Richard could not climb completely, Piru did not wait for the boy to surrender, even did not even hear. And every time they get tired and ready to go, Richard will slowly climb up and watch Piru quietly. The calm and calm eyes suddenly made Pilu feel the chill from the deepest part of her heart. That vision is like watching a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this year on, Piru began to have nightmares. Every time he hits Richard once, he will have a nightmare for a few days. Richard has never struggled against it, Piru has become more and more robust, and the gap between the two people is still expanding. But every time I saw Richard, Piru would see the boy's gaze, and then it would be a nightmare for a few days. Piru still has a little bit to understand, that is why Richard did not go to find his father. If the boy did this, then Pilu said that he had to lick a few lashes. However, from the beginning to the end, Richard did not mention any beatings with anyone in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
