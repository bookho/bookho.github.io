			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard sat alone at the bed, holding his forehead in both hands, just happened The thing is being played back in consciousness, and it is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Richard initially had a clear sense of potential danger, so when he was extremely angry with the servant’s attack, he chose to take full action. Counterattack, and ruthlessly smashed two servants with one hand, but fell to the ground under the attack of the third servant. This is the result that Richard had expected so far. He was not arrogant enough to think that he could win under the siege of three more than eight fighters. Being able to knock down two is already a result of fighting skills and adding unexpected results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this conflict was first experienced, Richard knew that the performance in the conflict did have a decent view of Archimonde. Such skirmishes are not mentioned in vagrants, but they are not uncommon. Every family that has successfully entered Faived has a lot of old hatreds and veterans. Therefore, Richard is also prepared for insults. Fokker’s stepping on his head is also an insulting thing. It is only an extreme, and it is an insult that is enough to cause bloody hatred. However, in the next moment, everything has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, the powerful force from Fokker’s foot is enough to crush Richard’s skull and trample his head like a fall Broken porcelain! At that moment, the true shadow of death enveloped all of Richard's consciousness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fokker wants to kill him! This is not a temporary rise, but a long-planned murder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never once, Richard and Death are so close. The blood parrot attacked him quietly and quickly, and Richard didn't even have time to feel scared. This time, the terror pressure from the bottom of the shoe, and the screaming of the skull under the pressure, are clearly replayed in consciousness, over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard is cold, and he is constantly shaking, and he feels a lack of power. He seems to lose consciousness and sink in the next moment. Boundless darkness. A burst of tingling was uploaded from the finger. It was a sequelae of repeated collisions with the body of an eight-level fighter with a fist. The knuckles were slightly swollen and irritated by sweat. But Richard wants to thank this pain so that he can stay awake. The sweat has long been ignorant, and the soaked clothes are tightly attached to the skin, which is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the sudden appearance of Ellie and Goliath, if that foot really stepped on the bottom... Richard couldn’t help but think about it, And think over and over again. He wants to control himself, but he can't suppress the fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When anger and humiliation temporarily disappear, there is only fear of death. That is the great fear that Richard never imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and forced himself to look at everything in the room and watch it carefully to expel the fear. However, the exact nature of the usual moments has become erratic. There are countless numbers, but Richard does not understand their meaning. It seems that the whole consciousness has been completely frozen. It was not until the long-awaited sword appeared in the line of sight that Richard’s heart leaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room in Richard is not big, just the suites inside and outside. The size of the bedroom is only a dozen square meters, so this long knife with only one and a half meters of blade edge takes up a small place. Because there is no scabbard, it is simply wrapped in animal skin and placed on the desk in front of the window. At this moment, the animal skin opened a corner, revealing a sharp blade inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s heart bumped and jumped. He jumped out of bed like a magic, slowly walked over to the desk, grabbed the handle, removed the animal skin that wrapped the blade, and closed his eyes, slowly. Breathing deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old long knife. Because of its shape, it can also be used as a sword. The thread wound on the handle has been worn, but it feels comfortable to hold. . Between breathing, Richard's consciousness slowly spread through the handle to the entire blade, and the blood of the Silver Moon elf in his body began to flow slowly, absorbing the faint monthly force in the celestial stalk and infusing it into the blade. So the long blade edge slowly has a faint color, and it changes with the different monthly strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, Richard’s mind was slowly settled, because the feeling of holding the knife in his hand was a feeling of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but start thinking about what happened just now, but this time the situation started to be different. He was using this long knife when simulating street corner conflicts. When you feel the danger, there is enough time to induce the force of the crescent moon, and in conjunction with the power increase caused by the explosion, the instantaneous lethality is tripled. A field of feathers is enough to kill most of the servants present. The aristocratic youth, and then the bursting of the blue moon will also bring a heavy blow to Fokker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when he is really close to death, or even touched the blade of the Death Sword, Richard really knows the fear and knows the importance of power. If no one stopped Fokker in time, even if the Archimonde family pursued it in the end, the Joseph family had to kill Fokker, but Richard himself was dead. The dead can not achieve any wish and dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking finally calmed down, everything in front of him began to return to normal, and Li breathed out a long breath, slowly putting the long knife down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat at the window and began to rethink today’s encounters. Many doubts emerged one by one. I always felt that one of them was very abnormal. Then he I found out that I know too little about the family and the world outside the family, and I can't reasonably link each link. At this time, the deep feeling of tiredness swept through the weak body of Richard, and rushed to the heart, so that he could not help but fall on the desk and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, a small brass bell in the room shook under the power of magic, and woke up from sleep. After seeing the blind eyes, Richard discovered that it was already night, and the room was dark, and only the moonlight shining through the window lit a small place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brass bell is still ringing, with a slight squeaking sound, Richard opened the door in the past, but the butler outside the door did not inform him to go to dinner. Instead, take him to the basement of the main castle building to participate in the family's internal trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a misty Richard followed the butler to the basement of the main building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ramp here is different from the dark and dampness of the ground part of the castle, but it is dry and stuffy everywhere. After passing through the gates guarded by two heavily armed knights, Richard was taken into a large-scale underground hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall of hundreds of square meters is two stories high, and some crimson flags hanging on the walls of the rock are decorated. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five chairs on the platform at the end of the hall, Gordon sits in the middle, and Goliath sits on the right side of Gotton, and then it is Ai Lily. On the left side of Gordon, there is an old wizard who is old, and a black leather armor with a cold middle-aged man. There were many Archimonde people standing along the walls on both sides of the hall. Even Richard saw a few boys and girls who had seen it at the dinner party that day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
