			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the ten gold coins that the Cavaliers threw at Richard’s flight In front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the shiny gold coins move according to the original trajectory, then there will be a pen lying on Richard's face. Of course, this kind of thing will not happen. All the gold coins in front of Richard are like an invisible barrier, and then they fall to the ground one by one. They jumped and made a crisp, sweet sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the team didn't move, and no one's eyes glanced at the gold a little. Hundreds of gaze are concentrated on the opposite knight, and the horses under his seat seem to be stronger than the master's induction, not only refused to move forward, but even intend to retreat, and began to appear violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard caressed his chin, where it was just cleaned, and no beard came out, making him feel less comfortable. When Sharon Weir was hiding and hiding, Richard’s chin and upper lip grew thick and short. Although he has the delicate face of the elf, the long beard is hard like a needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the surprised Viscount, not far away, Richard thought thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier blushes his face and pulls the whip hard, but the barbarian warrior ranks up to ten, standing firmly in the same place, arms cast like steel, letting the knight How to use force is not moving. And the abnormal movement of the war horse, the Cavaliers almost have to lose balance and fall, this is absolutely not allowed! His hand touched the epee hanging on the saddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier suddenly felt that there was a rush of wind around him, and he hadn’t waited for him to look around, and a strong wind leaped up. He rushed from the moment! The horse was suddenly frightened, broke out completely, and made a long sigh, raising the front hoof. Gangde has come out of the crowd, the giant axe is sloping, and the horse is even opened with an axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war horse fell to the sky, blood and internal organs rushed out of the wound. This shocking scene shocked Shim and his knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who was thrown down by the wind screamed loudly, the wind bite his right shoulder, licked it and immediately tore it off. A large piece of flesh and blood. The Cavaliers themselves have a strength close to eight, although they fell to the ground, but screaming, there is room for counterattack, but just a wave of punches, several barbarian warriors have swarmed up and pressed him firmly on the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, how to deal with!" A tall barbarian warrior asked murderously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Him and his men and said, "If you dare to pull the weapon, you will cut your right hand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him's knights had their hands on the hilt, and Richard's words immediately made their movements stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Heim screamed: "What do you say?! Say it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Observing the habit of not repeating orders, the soldiers under his command are very quick and complete, and will not give him a chance to repeat. Hem’s scream was only halfway. A barbarian warrior used the brute force to open the right arm of the knight. Another barbarian warrior raised the battle axe and fell axe, so the knight’s right arm immediately The body is divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xim shivered and pointed his finger at Richard and said, "You...you..." But he can't remember Richard's name. Excessive anger, humiliation, and the fear of never admitting it, mixed together, so that he could not say a complete sentence for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not pay attention to Him, but said to Gangde: "The next time you remember not to cut the horse, cut the person directly. The horse is very expensive, and the life is not worth the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gangde nodded hard and said loudly: "I know, head! Especially this kind of person, is a price with the dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applause nodded and said, "You are smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I upgraded, head!" Gangde said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard looked up at him and said faintly: "What do you think, and dare to hire my slave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him’s face instantly reddish like a drip, screaming in a voice comparable to the soprano: “I am the noble highland unicorn The title of the highland unicorn comes from..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wait for Him to finish, and Richard repeated his words: "What are you doing? Also dare to expropriate my slave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am noble..." Screaming half, and Hem suddenly awakened, so his face was already red and almost red. Purple, he cried hysterically: "You dare to insult me! You dare to insult me!! A squatting pioneer, actually dare to insult a noble viscount with the blood of the royal family! Come, kill me! No No, I want to keep him tormented, just cut off his limbs. Who dares to resist and kill together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jazz screaming voice echoed in the empty desert, Knight has half his men out of the sword, but before faltering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a few hundred people, and they only had twenty rides. These knights are not as eyeless as their masters, and naturally know that both the quantity and the quality, the two sides are inconsistent. If they really rushed up, Richard would only order a counterattack, and this would kill a few minutes. The power of the Viscount of Heim seems to be insufficient to allow the little pioneering knight to wait, which can be seen from the broken arm knight on the ground that is still tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Don't give it to me! Kill them, women stay!" Hem was furious, wielding the whip, and concentrating on the guards around him. Draw it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the guards shouted and made a charge, and they moved forward. However, their horse speed is slower than walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pioneers once again disappointed the guards, and Richard did not withdraw as they thought, so as to give everyone a step. The pioneering knight himself does not need to step down, and it does not seem to be ready for the Viscounts to have a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard just repeated his previous order: "Dare to pull the weapon, cut off the right hand." And the soldiers under his command are immediately faithful. The command was executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guards of the Viscounts of Shim are among the martial arts and warriors with high ranks. They are not willing to be cut off the fate of their right hand, so they are surrounded by barbarian warriors. Was cut down by the chaos. After the fifth person fell, the guards finally gave up the resistance. And a few guards who have not pulled out their weapons are rejoicing their luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xim was completely scared, and he used his trembling fingers to look at Richard, his mouth and mouth, but he couldn’t speak. Two barbarian warriors pulled him from the horse and dragged him to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
