You and the old housekeeper will help me to release the news tomorrow. In this case, the number of candidates for the Cavaliers will be expanded to 50, and the conditions will remain unchanged. How much is needed, but once you enter the service, you have to work for me for five years. After five years, they have the right to choose to leave. Finally, it is the time and place of recruitment. The time is set after two months, and Location... Just put it in the Black Rose Castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Rose Castle!" Faschi whispered and quickly reminded Richard: "There Now occupied by the Archimonde Family Council. Are you sure you want to be there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee reveals Sen Han’s smile and says, "I remember that man. At the time of the time, I have never heard of any family council. Now, I only know that the Black Rose Castle is the territory left by the man, so it can only belong to me. I want to be In the recruitment ceremony, no one can stop it. If there is such a guy who can’t think of it, I don’t mind using blood to keep them awake! The guys who smashed the fire, it’s time to pay the price. I heard that Archimonde’s patriarchs have always been When it comes out, the Presbyterian Church only maintains the rules of the family. It is stipulated that it is not allowed to participate in other affairs. So what is the shit’s family council from where? Where did they come from, they will give me a place to go back? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi sighed and used a direct way to remind Richard: "I heard that behind the scenes, the family council is the Marquis of Soren, brother. Earl of Lia is also involved in it. Are you ready to fight with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl dare to take a nap with them?" Suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling Ellie, Faschi is immediately proud and screams: "The Earl of the Earl will be afraid of them? The Duke of Soram of the Holy Tree Dynasty is still legendary Strong, the count is not a mistake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, since Ellie is not afraid, what am I afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Richard’s decision spread through the channels of the Holy Alliance and spread throughout the alliance. For a time, this news became the core topic of discussion among the nobility, and even overwhelmed the civil war between the two great dukes within the Holy Alliance, and a small war that broke out on the southern border of the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, as long as you have the keyword knight, it will become a good topic, not to mention that Richard is also the royal architect of the Holy Alliance. The recent surge in momentum is incomparably strong. The second-order set of secret guides and the release of life have established the status of the first royal constructor of the Holy Alliance, and suppressed the original royal architect Lu Nuo. No more sounds can be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the people who are touching the nerves, but Richard announced the number of candidates to recruit the candidate, a full fifty ride! You know, Richard's knights will no doubt be a suit knight, not an ordinary knight, but even if you don't consider the personal qualities of the knights, it is equivalent to the second-order knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-order knight of a squadron, this power is even enough to constitute a core force of the Duke. Now, if it is less than a year before Richard first appeared in Fu Shide, he can already have such force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More interested in the nobility is the place where Richard is appointed. He did not choose the floating island, nor did he choose any of the old territory that is still in his hands, but chose the black rose castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that shortly after the accident in Gordon, the general who guarded the Black Rose Castle joined the recently established Archimonde House of Parliament and used the power of the family council to suppress the resistance of the Constitute troops and let the family The parliament successfully entered the traditional territory of the Archangel patriarch of the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard is in the Archimonde's family cemetery, and the family council has the Black Rose Castle. The two sides have formed a deadlock, and everyone claims to have a patriarch. All rights. Therefore, Richard’s decision is undoubtedly a declaration of war to the Presbyterian Church and the sharp movement of the free Archimonde warrior to the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the result of a formal collision between the two Archimonean forces? After two months, is the two sides a compromise or a tough war? This is a topic of interest to almost all aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone thinks that the madness of these guys in Archimonde will definitely resolve their differences with swords and tomahawks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a nobleman whose family history surpassed the history of the Alliance. He once laughed at the party and said, "Akmund knows what the parliament means? Do you think they think? A group of elders and patriarchs gathered together for a meeting. The people present were not smiling. They all heard that Gotton directly stunned a branch patriarch with his fist at the first plenary session of the so-called family council. As the end of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for who wins and who wins, it becomes the focus of controversy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a rising star, and behind the family council there is obviously the support of the old Akmon Soren and Goliath, tending to The number of nobility in the family's final victory party is even more. After all, Richard’s rise is still too short. What kind of cards he holds in his hand is also a mystery. Moreover, force is only a part of strength, and fists can solve most problems, but they cannot solve them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This controversy never yields results, so the nobles chose the most traditional way of deciding: the gambling to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether most of the nobles were arrogant about their high scores, some related people were not excited at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Rose Castle, a group of Eckmund elders convened an emergency meeting, and the patriarchs of the branch could certainly not stay in the old castle, so stay here now. It is them who presided over the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders were noisy at the meeting, had lunch at the conference table, had dinner, and couldn’t make any noise. During the whole day of the meeting, some people were really exhausted, but some of them really kept their eyes on the situation. They knew that there was no approval from the person behind them. These guys in the family council who look like ages and identities are long. It’s the clown in front of the stage, and what decisions are like fart. In the end, the family council passed a resolution deciding the most severe condemnation of Richard’s rude behavior in ignoring family meetings and retaining the right to take all actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution was passed, but how to send the resolution to the hands of the nobility has become a real problem. Through the royal channel, Richard can send the announcement to every corner of the league within a few days in the form of a notice. The family council does not have such a means, and they have no way to use the alliance. Because this requires cost. The funding for the family council is very, very, very doubtful. So the elders decided to continue the meeting the next day to study how to send the condemnation statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
