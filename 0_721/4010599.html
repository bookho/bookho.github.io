			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult,." The sudden change occurred, all the knights of the formation When I came up, if I didn't care about Richard, the eight-handed sword had been walking through Melin's body several times, but when they saw what happened, they all stayed for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great Druids of the Yongye tribe stood at the door at the moment, just like two sculptures. From their perspective, they just saw the last tragic scene. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline, the pride of the Yongye tribe, has fallen like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood ran down the hair of the forehead, pasted Richard’s eyes, and then continued to flow down, Richard’s body holding Melin’s body, eyes But staring in the empty space, the focus of the line of sight did not know where it was, and Richard was so motionless and had no expression on his face, as if he was in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult." Next to a knight, the knight slowed down and tempted Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a reaction at this time, slowly lowered Melin’s body and stood up, whispering like a self-speaking: The people I killed were still too few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned and walked to the house, and said to the two great Druids before leaving: " Take care of her body and bury it according to the highest specifications of the tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard strode out of the room and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard appeared on the roof of his home. He had washed away the blood stains of his body, and he stood neatly, standing so lonely, sacred The unicorn was summoned, rushing from a distance, jumping directly onto the rooftop, standing next to Richard, and suddenly a huge shadow passed through the sky, and the star also flew over, at low altitude. Suspended, the star shape shrinks a lot at this time, only 20 meters long, the twilight is also summoned, according to Richard's instructions, she also called Nolan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard, the holy unicorn, and the twilight and Nolan on the star, the star sings and then flies up and flies to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carrying capacity of the star is very small, and it shrinks the volume. Therefore, the speed is far faster than the full load. The speed can reach 120 kilometers per hour. The star does not know how tired it is. As long as there is sufficient energy, it can fly all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour in the blink of an eye, the star-shaped flying in the Yulin sea can already feel the obvious forest will, and now the forest will be hit hard, and there is no room for it. Adding suppression to Richard, and there are three beasts on the star, none of them are afraid of the will of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly pressed down the star, then jumped into the forest, and randomly found an old tree, and pressed his right hand on the trunk, dozens of light bands Shooting from the arm and instantly piercing the trunk, this old tree is immediately activated. The vitality of years of savings is activated and ignited, and then an extremely strong natural force is shot into the sky, and then turned into a little bit of raindrops, spilling the earth. At this moment, Richard’s will has cut into the forest will, and then said: “Slang, I am coming.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the sentence They are very dull, just like telling a trivial little thing. However, the twilight on the stars and Nolan feel that the voice of Richard is ringing in their ears. They are not ordinary strong people. Nolan has more than The strength of the profound, an incredible thoughts floated from Nolan's heart: "Where the forest will be, you can hear the voice of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, Richard has jumped on the star, still standing on the head, starburst Gently a red square, a streamlined body and quietly fly one hundred meters air, and then continue toward a predetermined place darting, muster the tree was Richard trees, it has been completely withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the proverbs suddenly became confused, and all the elves in the tribe heard the voice of Richard! The news of the defeat in the front has already been passed. Back to the tribe, as the main force of the war, the tribal tribes also suffered heavy losses. Nearly half of the elite warriors in the tribe were killed, eleven elders were killed and five others were seriously injured. The entire tribe wants to recover its vitality for at least 50 years. Wherever they can resist the army of Richard, and they can hear the voice of Richard, it means that Richard will be able to find it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the proverb tribe, the other surviving guardian elves mostly heard the voice of Richard, and Richard used the forest will as a carrier to spread his voice. Throughout the forest, the surviving guardian elves were all in chaos and panic, and the elves who came back from the battlefield felt that they saw the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, countless messages were intertwined and transmitted over the forest. The defenders of the demons did not hesitate to use their power to exchange information. They were unable to conceal their panic, especially when other tribes heard the same. The sound of panic is even more unstoppable. The content of this sentence is very simple, but it is not simple that Richard can let his voice spread throughout the forest. This kind of thing can’t be thought of. The more he thinks, the more he fears. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest camp has already returned to the Yi language tribe, but suddenly stopped, the big elders in the hall are extremely ugly, and the hands are still unable to control, trembling, outside It’s already a police whistle, and countless fighters are flocking to their posts, looking for enemies that are still thousands of kilometers away. The hall is still silent. The elder elders are bloodless, just looking at the big The elders have long lost their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Kara, the guardian spirit is desperately trying to avoid an idea, but can not let it pop out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the proverb can feel the pressure of the sinking, and he insisted on sending a gift to Richard, and indeed sent it. But in a twinkling of an eye, all the elves heard the declaration of Richard: Proverb, I am coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders know that they must do something at this time, and shouted: "What are you afraid of? The invaders’ army can’t wear the forest, go to the Jade Leaf tribe, to the world. The tree prayed, we need to see how this Richard is going to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the elders let the slang elves feel their spirits and immediately busy, after a while A magical image is formed in the center of the hall. In the image, it is the star in the sky. The three beasts standing above are also clear and abnormal. The world tree has the power close to the gods. The forest will equals it. The eyes, where the forest will be, are the horizons of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only a few people." A guardian elf can't believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other elf lost his voice: "No, they are fast, God, as long as three days can come to our tribe."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at his direction, he went to the four-leaf clover tribe. Should he first destroy the four-leaf clover tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very likely that this is a smooth road, there is no way to go around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noisy voice makes the head of the proverb elders violently hurt, can’t help I yelled: "Give me shut up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall was finally quiet, and his eyes were once again concentrated on the elders, and he was also speechless. Pressure, the elders stared at the image of Richard, suddenly screamed with anger, said: "It's really crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star in the image Underneath it, the soft light shines. Underneath it, Lin Hai constantly squats on both sides, but it directs all the weight to the ground, leaving behind a tens of meters wide visible trajectory behind it, so that the star can reduce energy consumption and speed up Speed, but so vast, will be discovered after more than a dozen kilometers. Richard not only has no intention of hiding, but also fears that the guardian elves do not know his destination. Obviously, Richard is neither afraid of ambush nor guardian spirit. They assembled troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tribes of the guardian elves are badly hurt, but Richard is relying on this person on the star, and wants to capture the proverb, as the whole forest is second only to The powerful tribe of Emerald Leaf, the proverb has been so despised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of slang elves are getting more and more angry, and if they want to spurt fire, they want to assemble troops, and they will fight with Richard in the tree of life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the elders of the proverbs closed their eyes, he was recalling, recalling every detail of the battle in the forest camp that day, Richard was in front of his eyes Killed the black robe, and the power of God, the elder is clearer than anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the elders finally opened their eyes, and the tired face was ten years old, and said in a low voice: "Notify the tribe, prepare... Migrating the Tree of Life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Migrating the Tree of Life, Why." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang elves suddenly became a mess, migrating the tree of life, meaning that the proverbs will be lost in the next few decades, The heavy price is second only to the annihilation of the tribe, so that the elders of the proverbs made such a decision, indicating that he believes that Richard is only able to kill the slang by relying on the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
