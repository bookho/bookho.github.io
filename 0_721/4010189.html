			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After winning the Greenson plane, Gordon used a low-level offer The sacrifice, plus the Space Magic Division headed by the Dragon Master, corrects the coordinates of the plane and adds a magical math lock to the fixed plane, but these are not unbreakable. The Schumpeterian family may not have this ability, and his allies may not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s face sank and made a melodious whistle in the air. Then the alarm bell in the city sounded, and a team of soldiers rushed out of the barracks. In accordance with the command of the commander, they rushed to the direction of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lina has used a full thousand people to firmly enclose the plane portal. As long as the enemy is inside, she will immediately give a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that she is very aware of the current situation of Archimonde, can first use the grace of the influence of Greenson, and the plane of the plane has shown signs of large-scale transmission, so The big hand, the young little Richard can't be found anyway. The most important thing is that the fixed plane transfer door at Noland's head is silent. It is reasonable to say that after the original magic lock is turned on, it should automatically send a start message to this side. The signs now only show that someone has opened a new plane portal and pointed to the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense was laid out, and Lina stared at the plane portal. She judged that this time it is possible that Mensa joined forces with Schumpeter and planned to recapture the Greenson plane. If this is the case, then this will be a hard battle, even a war that must be defeated. However, before the defeat, Lina intends to give Mensa and Schumpeter a profound lesson. It is impossible to win a victory from Archimonde without paying a terrible price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an extremely tense atmosphere, the plane portal finally began to fluctuate, and a team of heavy-duty soldiers armed to the teeth stepped out of the portal. They jerked the tower shield as tall as the whole person to protect the whole body, carefully maintaining a dense formation and moving forward. They are called ultra-luxury protection, unless it is a strong shot at close range, or with a magical saturation bombardment, it is possible to completely eliminate this team of fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they stepped out of the portal, they suddenly saw that they were surrounded by groups. At least one hundred hands were aiming at themselves, and they immediately jumped and slammed. Back to the tower shield, and close together, form a curved steel barrier, while protecting the portal behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lina has already seen the family emblem of Archimonde on their tower shield, so the heart is loose, telling the soldiers to remain calm and not to fire. But she did not order the removal of the line of defense, it may also be the conspiracy of Mensa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the stepping knight with the Holy Alliance royal badge. Their unique armor style is a short-term counterfeit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, and then she let go of her heart. She knew that it was indeed a reinforcement. The royal family would not know how to participate in the civil war. They appeared in place. On the battlefield, there must be an alliance with a certain family or power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the momentum of the reinforcements has been extraordinary, the luxury of the Royal Steps Knights has long been known, but the team that first came out of the portal The equipment of Kemond's reloading warrior is more than the Royal Step Knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did Archimonde become so rich? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors who were uneasy around the portal found out that they were reinforcements, and the military capacity was extremely strong. They even included the Royal Steps Knight, and cheered up! As each team walks out of the portal, they will burst into cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full set of 500 Royal Step Knights, it takes a long time to pass the portal. Behind them, there are two hundred bloody guards belonging to Agamemnon, and the coat of arms on the scarlet long cloak with the main pattern of the fragrant roots is very eye-catching. Later, it was a team of Archimonde fighters. There were only ten soldiers in this group, and the first batch was only twenty. However, the luxury of their equipment, the magical light of that, is enough to make people dazzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, five knights stepped out of the portal. They did not have the Mark of the Archimonde family, but they stood with the Archimonde soldiers. The five magical rides of the tall and big cockroaches make people feel cold in the first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Constructing the Cavaliers!" I don't know who suddenly screamed, so it was a bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic ride has a striking pattern on the chest, which is the mark of the structure. Can have the loaded structure of the ride, only the construction of the knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The built-in knight has almost become a symbol of invincibility and the spiritual pillar of Noland’s battlefield. In history, there are many unknowns in the situation in which the knights are dispatched and the victory is established. Therefore, as long as the construction of the knight has not been dispatched, the fighting spirit of the soldiers will not die easily. Seeing the formation of a whole team of knights, all the soldiers broke out with earth-shattering cheers! Since the knights have been dispatched, it is time to drive those big monkeys back into the depths of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of a small team on the morale of the Cavaliers completely surpassed the more than 700 elite warriors who were fierce like wolves. Although the latter can rely on the number of ordinary squadrons of ten squads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Lina is incredibly covering her mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect to wait for such a generous support. But her heart suddenly floated a layer of worry, did Richard climb the thigh of the royal family? It is not impossible to be the identity of his royal architect, but the danger of doing so is actually much bigger than climbing a floating island giant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s the followers of Richard. Among them, the tiramisu that appeared on the back of the huge magic ride made everyone lose their voice! His second head has grown a little more than half, the thick steel armor, the thick and terrible chain all declare the terrible power of the high-ranking ogre. And his magical ride is even more terrible than the ogre itself, and its body is always emitting a faint pressure, such as the same dragon to slowly pass, seems to break the portal at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is Richard, quicksand, Nyris and Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred unicorn of Richard instantly attracted the attention of Lina, and she almost screamed out. Even in Noland, unicorns are rare and hard to tame. Richard actually got a shot without a word! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped off the unicorn and went to Lina. He smiled and said, "Lina, this time is hard for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, no, nothing!" I don't know why, Lina felt heartbeat and some confusion when she looked at Li Qingqing's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard and Gordon are too similar, like to make her somewhat lost. It's not just the similarity of gestures and tone, but the momentum of everything that is mastered is very similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
