			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strong players in the outer battles who think of Richard as delineating for them The airspace, looking back at this time, I saw the colorfulness in the sky behind me, a spear throwing a spear with a gorgeous vindictive light, flying into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some dragons look down on these spears like toothpicks, not dodge, but the claws are hard to pick up, and the result immediately suffers a big loss, and some are injured. Some dragon claws were pierced, and several unlucky dragons were set by a dozen knights. As a result, seven or eight spears were thrown, and they fell from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong ones who are stuck in the designated airspace, each with three to five knights for fixed-point support, each strongman is like a fortress, forcing The dragons had to be dispersed, and they had to bear the constant attack of the knights underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who can move freely, except for Richard’s tyrannical followers, there is only one heavenly sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These strong people saw the taste and hurriedly fled to their original airspace, but several people were chased and killed by the dragons when they ran away. Shortly after the war, the Richards killed more than ten sacred domains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha face sinks in the water, shuttles back and forth on the battlefield, as fast as the wind, and his body is always a combination of demons and angels. With a low voice, the dragons fell from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landing dragon was immediately surrounded by the early-prepared Frost Warrior, and the heavy weapons in their hands were so powerful that it was a good thing to deal with the dragon. This time, the Ogre Lord was really able to catch the battle, running on the ground, roaring and turning a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Carcarol and Tanan and the faceless battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It roars and shakes the sky, but Tanan is extremely tenacious, and every time he rushes back, the faceless knight is like Ghosts appear from time to time on Carolol, and will disappear after two knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is glued, but Carolol actually still has the upper hand, its slam is getting more and more fierce, and the dragon's interest is followed by a bite, as long as no face Being hit, or Taran’s defense is a little slower, the metal dragons can immediately hit them and pull them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly stopped and stared at Carol, his eyes turned into erect, and then spit out a slogan: "Chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Carol suddenly felt like he was being occupied by a large net. Numerous forces were attached to him and pulled in all directions. Now every movement will be deformed and even the simplest claws will fall. As for direct flights. It will definitely become an S-type. If you want to revolve, it is possible to fly straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol roared, the dragon force burst, and instantly shattered countless traction fields, although more force fields were regenerated, but as many as many times The power of the god language magic will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the metal dragon was held down, Richard had seized the gap and issued a key order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hundred arrows and beasts that have been silent at the same time have their heads raised at the same time, and they have begun to shine in their eyes. Then three hundred arrows are sprayed at the same time. A brilliant trajectory goes straight to Carcarol in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal dragon looked away, and he suddenly found that every arrow that was fired was actually a flame of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screamed, ran away regardless of everything, even the faceless machine fell on its back, no need to slash the sword, just escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred profit arrows turn in the same direction, chasing Carroll, people are shocked, three hundred miles are still halfway, the beast Once again, he launched three hundred magical tracking arrows driven by the power of Shenjing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two arrows smashed in the rain, smashed the sky in an instant, caught up with Carocar, and then gathered like a group of birds to the forest. The body of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is constantly blooming with golden dragon's blood flowers, hundreds of flowers are in full bloom, it is an unforgettable picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal dragon is flying, struggling, roaring, but every struggle will make more arrows fall on the body, these are the source of strength The killer, that is, Carol's strong dragon body can not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first wave of arrows, Carcarol is already bruised and bruised, and then the second wave of arrows is raining again, and it is a dense flower of dragon blood. The sky blooms, and in the golden flower sea, Carcarol finally falls to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's figure flashed, and it appeared in the back neck of Carolol. The moonlight and the ruling were deeply inserted until there was no handle. Then Richard immediately pulled the knife and sent it to a hundred meters away. He escaped the legend of anger. The dragon, the last shock wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over." Richard said faintly, watching Carol's dragon body fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face appeared in the side of Richard, very uncomfortable to say: "You grab business, this is not authentic."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid there will be variables."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With me, can there be any variables."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at the faceless face and said, "This is hard to say. For example, someone just forgot to say the number of dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard rushed into the battlefield, or used a god language, or used a double knife to pounce a dragon, on the ground, naturally there are tiramisu and cold cream warriors waiting. they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is parked in the air, shrugging his shoulders and saying to himself, "What is there, anyway, it’s not yours, it’s better to die. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Carcarol as the head, there are nearly a hundred dragons killed, only a dozen heads fleeing, and Richard’s side killed twelve The domain, which also includes two strong men attached to the Akmon family, built a knight to kill five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Frost Warrior has lost a lot of money because of the direct fight with the dragon, and he died more than 60 times. This is the god of the frosty warrior. Before Richard lays a new kingdom of God, one will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast is intact, but each of the beasts can only shoot three rounds of crystal arrows. Now they have used two rounds and the actual combat power is consumed by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally prepared to use the three sacred crystal arrows to leave three legends, but now it is a two-shot exchange of a legendary metal dragon, count it up It is not a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Carolol’s dragon body lay on the ground and left a deep gully behind him, even if he was dead, that The body looks still full of majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sacrifice." Richard pointed to the dragon's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." No face to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to Faro, including Tanan, and those who are still alive, the Sanctuary are both sad and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who know each other are always in the dragon plane, and the living people are huge, less than twenty survivors, everyone has won It is equivalent to the income of a complete dragon, but it is more than a high-level sacrifice. The ordinary sanctuary may take several years to get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once-in-a-life Carcarol became a piece of dragon crystal in the hands of no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about one hundred dragons belonging to Richard, accounting for half of the total, so there are more than one hundred dragon crystals in the pocket. The dragon crystal of each dragon is a valuable sacrifice, and the dragon crystal of the metal dragon is the top sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a number of Longjing, according to the faceless statement, just barely forced her to ascend to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very curious about this, because it should be more than enough, so Richard can't help but ask no face, then no face to answer thoroughly Let him be speechless: because she needs extra grace to condense better equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the theory of no face, since Richard has two artifacts in his hand, then the great faceless knight enters the legend, naturally not too shabby, so She is ready to update all her equipment, from head to toe, to an artifact level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing to say, if the faceless equipment is all replaced with artifacts, then only use this point of grace, and indeed save to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless knight only needs Longjing, and a lot of materials are left to Richard on the dragon. This is actually a huge wealth, and the value is not in Longjing. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than a hundred dragons, Richard is ready to use the dragon material as a basis to dress up all of his own knights. About five hundred rides can be armed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, dozens of mages have been busy in the dragon plane, a large number of knights shuttle back and forth, acting as a coolie to transport building materials, and guarding the guards More recruiting mages are coming from Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward base built by Richard in the dragon plane is huge. Under the whole base is a giant magic array, which can greatly increase the magic power. This forward base is costly, and some facilities can even rival the magic tower. Therefore, the total investment is expected to be More than 10 million, it takes 100 senior mages to work in three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the base, as long as there is a legendary mage resident, even if the five-color dragon comes, it can also guard for a period of time until the base reserve magic crystal It’s exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has agreed with the two legendary mages to hire them to take turns to advance the base at the cost of a high-level sacrifice every three months, during which time the base The loot that was obtained was owned by the mages, and Richard did not take any share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to be on the right track, and Faro seems to have decided on the big picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his room, opened the magic map, and silently looked at the vivid continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the mark of the end of the day and played it in his hands. This is a habit of him. Whenever he feels that he lacks direction or motivation, he will take the mark of the end. Come out and have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you see a mechanical monster that changes rapidly, it’s like pouring a bowl of ice water on your head, letting Richard thoroughly wake up and understand the whole Faro. Both are in the process of counting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the magic map, Faro has indeed decided that the overall situation has not been conquered, and the basic situation has long been known, such as the south of the Principality. In the vast area, Richard did not free his hands to conquer before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical map, the real unknown zone, is the initial city in the depths of the Zuyuan highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the blank. No one knows what is hidden in that place, what it is, even the barbarians themselves are not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha searched the entire Faro, and did not find any records about the initial city, there is like a black hole, anyone who goes in, no longer Nothing has happened, and no records have flowed out. Even the name of the original city can't find a source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
