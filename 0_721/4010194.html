Just treat them as the coffins of the warriors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, more than a dozen torches burned. The trees in the fire made a painful roar, they writhed the branches and wanted to escape. But without the promotion of the Elf, they could not leave the land. It was only the pain of the burning of the fire that was too strong to force them to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green environment of the green surface is not easy to catch fire, but it cannot completely block the magical fire. From the depths of the forest, there were several angry whistling, and it was obvious that the elves who were hidden in the dark could not control their anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li stood silent for a while before waving: "Well, go back. Continue to cut trees today."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the soldiers today is exceptionally large, and nearly 20,000 trees have been cut down, only to stop. The soldiers spontaneously piled the rock into piles of wood, slowly lit, and then a dozen huge fires appeared around the city. From the evening to the night, the flames are still not extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard sounded the door of Lina and said to the Master of the Dragon: "Let's go with me to see the forest walking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people came to the wall in tandem. Richard directly blessed himself with a feathering technique and jumped out of the city. This was an extremely dangerous action, and the Dragon Master was taken aback and immediately followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side, stayed until the edge of the forest and stopped, waiting silently. Nights and forests are the world of elves, and the forest under the night is even more dangerous. But Richard and Lina are not afraid at all, and the elves are not a deadly threat to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange noise in the depths of the forest. It is a strange friction sound. The sound is getting louder and louder, and the ground is starting to vibrate slightly. A huge black shadow was removed from the depths of the forest. It was a big tree. Its roots have been pulled out of the ground and moved forward like a beast. But it is not a tree, because there is no human face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old tree walked in front of Richard and Lina, walked out of the forest, chose a place that he thought was appropriate, and began to plunge the roots deeply. soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this ancient tree, there are countless giant trees removed from the forest, walking all the way to the open space outside the forest, and then plunging one by one Go to the roots. After about a few hundred trees were removed from the forest, the forest was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid, hidden in the depths of the forest, seems to have run out of magic. The number of trees removed during these two days is far from the number of trees that have been felled. In the other directions, Druid is also driving the forest, but together they drive thousands of trees out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and kill the Druid?" Richard suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina is quite heart-warming, but when she thinks about it, she shakes her head and says, "The night and the forest are their world. At this time, we can't find him." Still don't bother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trying there is no harm." Richard laughed, then first plunged into the forest. Master Long quickly followed, she was not afraid of the elves and Druids in the forest, but worried that Richard was in danger. Even at the peak of power, the legal person has a repressive advantage over the warriors, but the battlefield is different, and the white blade is still the place where the magician is buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gradually, Master Long found that he had some difficulties in keeping up with Richard. Richard's movements are coordinated and stretched, and it will slide far away on the ground. He seems to be integrated into the environment, and any action is just right, without spending extra effort. The more I look at Lina, the more I am scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the footwork that Richard learned from the White Nights in the battlefield of the extremist, and is gradually integrating with his own dark world combat skills and sacred fighting techniques. He still can't do the extra action like the white night, and every move is simple and effective. But looking at Lina's eyes, it was enough shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two people turned around in the forest in the middle of the night for more than an hour, but they found nothing, and finally had to wear the dew on their heads and wandering from the forest. Drilled out. The elf Druid is the son of the forest, and it is extremely difficult to find them. From the face of Gotton's occupation of the Greenson plane, it has been seen that it has not been able to kill an elf Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Lina look at each other and see that each other is just like the wet chicken, and there are a few leaves on the head. Wolverine, so I was relatively smiling, and then it became a laugh that could not be stopped. After laughing, Lina felt a lot easier, and the shadows of the day had faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly turned to Richard and said, "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugs and says : "I am just helping myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked to the city, this is a long and short distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Richard: "Lina, ask you a question. You think, if it is... well, Gordon is here, how would he handle this? The situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be the same as what you do, cut the tree! If he thinks this forest is the elf's nest, then he will cut the forest directly Light," Lina said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the dark forest and said, "This forest is as big as it can never be cut."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big forest, as long as it has been cut down, there will always be a day to see the end. This is what he said to us when he decided to cut trees." Lina finished, look Looking at Richard, the mind said in a complicated way: "In fact, you are very similar to him. It looks like anxious. In fact, when you need it, you have more patience than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Richard is undecided. Under the cover of the night, Master Long could not see his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is being cut every day, day after day, never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became very patient, no matter when he was smiling, even the speed of walking became slower, it seems to be like this. A lifetime of lumberjacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral has returned, he brought back ten elite humanoid knights. In addition to the humanoid knight also encountered the unclear portal pass delay, which made Oral stunned for more than ten minutes, and the high channel cost, no other trouble. At the same time, he also brought a lot of supplies back according to the list of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, everyone thought that Oral was coming back, and Richard was about to go to war. But everything is as old as the elf poet has been in the week, and Richard still has no big moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are a lot of things to do in Richard. Even if you hide and draw the structure, you will be accompanied by Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab door is closed, who knows what they are doing inside. Flowing sand wants to smash the door of the laboratory, but of course she does not do it herself, but is prepared to let others do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are no idiots in the team, and even Nyris is not willing to step into such a trap. Liusha suddenly found himself in an unprecedented dilemma. As a god, go to eat a servant of a maid and slave girl? Of course not. But is Qi Qi the same as an ordinary maid? Liu Sha suddenly found that Qi Qi gave his positioning a subtle effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is impossible to understand the battle, it is the only choice to secretly give Richard some punishment. As for the punishment, the idea of ​​not letting Richard go to bed in the night instinctively came out. However, Liusha immediately denied the idea of ​​this idiot. If he really wants to do this, he will only be cheaper. How much more dragged Richard to bed? Is this a punishment or a reward? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand holding his little face, painfully tangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are not as leisurely as Richard, especially the eager Nyris, who has been in the Greenson plane for a whole month, he only really hits A moment, this can not be in line with his expectations. In the past, he participated in the plane war. When did he not enter the plane, he immediately entered the endless war? The shouts and blood on the battlefield always make him excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, it’s a month passed. Richard was deeply impressed by the unshakable spirit and did not hurry to complete two sets of wild barriers. Due to the calmness of the production, the set bonus effect has a small increase. In the spare time, Richard is studying the magical armed forces, and there will be breakthroughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of the second month, Richard took a leisurely footstep and walked around the city to see what the soldiers were doing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the small square at the entrance of the Armory, dozens of soldiers are releasing a piece of armor and applying grease on the side. In a wet climate, this is an important means of preventing armor corrosion. Although magic is easy to use, the cost is still too expensive, and when is the labor, it is an inexpensive choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard specifically asked Oral to purchase tons of premium oil from Noland for maintenance of armor. There are many similar military supplies, and the overall cost is still huge. In the era when Dragon Master alone supported it, this scene could not be seen. Gordon didn’t leave her much military expenses at all, and even the funds for regular updates of weapons were not enough. Where can I be extravagant to pay attention to logistics supply. In the concept of the Dragon Master, the so-called logistics, in addition to the arrow, is dry food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was watching the soldiers with their arms in great interest. Nyres rushed in and saw Richard’s eyes lit up and said loudly: Hey! Richard! I can find you! I can't do this anymore, we have to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at Nyres, Smiled: "How can you be so impatient?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, we have spent a lot of money, but we are always in the city." Nyris knows Richard's math and economy are very good, so he tried to convince him from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn’t it going back to a batch of rare wood last week? You can sell at least 100,000 in Noland! You see, our income is good, can It’s not uncommon to get 100,000 in the first month,” Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris once stopped talking, and finally said something crazy: "Speak straight, Richard, I want to fight! This wet weather makes me every The roots are sore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
