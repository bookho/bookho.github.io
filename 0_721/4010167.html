			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the conditions stated by Richard, the Masters Association is completely impossible to accept. In this way, the war is completely inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle of the line, Richard has shown an incredible war talent. However, the Masters Association is different from the ordinary forces, the sixteen great magisters, just think about it will make people feel heavy. Therefore, even if it was the aristocrat who followed the bloody land of Richard, he was not optimistic about the prospects of Richard in this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever nobles will also think that Richard is actually retreating, and the ultimate goal is to negotiate with the Masters Association and eventually share the same in the Sequoia Kingdom. interest. Just like what politicians do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next day, a paper statement by the president of the Masters Association, Theodore, smashed the guess. Theodore's declaration is concise but leaves no room for it: "The Masters Association will do everything in its power to completely destroy all those who destroy the order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha does not agree, just to the red All the nobles of the Shan Kingdom issued a request to borrow, and proposed free passage in the aristocratic territory in order to carry out a war with the Masters Association. Anyone who blocks the army of Richard will be attacked by Richard as an alliance of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few days, the raging fire began to burn in the Sequoia Kingdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of this war is huge, the momentum is fierce, and the wide-ranging involvement makes the war madmen like Iowa so excited! For the first time in life, fighting The priest felt that Richard did not look so pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association has gathered more than 30 large and small aristocrats to form a coalition of up to 40,000 people. The most striking thing is that there are kingdom knights in the coalition. . The Knights of the Kingdom is the most elite of the exclusive royal family, with a total number of two thousand. They well filled the shortcomings of the Master's lack of high-end ground power. Although the Knights from the deputy head to the Cavaliers all claimed to participate in the war as individuals, they have implicitly indicated the royal position to the nobility in the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the multi-year accumulation of the Masters Association, as a result, more than half of the nobility in the kingdom has joined the coalition, and many of them have participated in the Richard’s plan. noble. Although they also have interests in the business road, but between Richard and the Master Association, they are not optimistic about Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the three Dukes remained silent in this war, even the Duke of Glasgow, who had close ties to the royal family, did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Alliance of the Masters Association, Li immediately immediately sent people back to the Blue Water Oasis, monitoring all the aristocratic troops in Oasis City. Richard has already said that all the armed forces in Oasis City have been requisitioned, or they are allowed to give up all weapons and armor and horses to return to the kingdom territory. Those who dare to resist will be killed on the spot and will not be captured. If you want to stay neutral, you need to hand over all weapons and horses and keep your armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats and generals who stayed in Oasis City mostly fought side by side with Richard, and had long been deeply feared by Richard. Therefore, most of them choose to sit on the sidelines, but there are also very few generals who will take advantage of their own force. Richard and his generals are not in the Oasis City. There is only a girl-like sand, so they rebelliously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is personally in battle, leading the humanoid knight to fight against the rebels, just outside the oasis city, a hundred humanoid knights rushed back and forth, killing three times The enemy has collapsed into a military, and in the end almost killed the rebels, and they only paid a few casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, although the human-shaped knight is higher than the strength factor, it is more because of the magical flow of sand. The quicksand allows the nobility to understand that a powerful priest can completely reverse the outcome of a small-scale battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the situation in the rear, the sands led the troops left to leave Oasis City, leaving only a thousand troops that were slaves to change their status. The aristocrats united, the force was almost ten times that of Richard's remaining troops, but after the head was killed by the sand, the others were much more secure. It is very easy to kill Richard’s thousand defenders. The question is how to face Richard’s next revenge? In addition to the aristocrats who have run through the line plan, the blue water oasis and the remains of the original Oasis Parliament members Jinhui Battle Flag, the Devil's Gun and other big business groups are still eyeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stabilizing the rear, Richard assembled all the troops in his own territory and reorganized them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp of Richard, there are also kingdom nobles, but there are not more than ten, and there are really three people in the district. Except for the Baron Chaket, it is surprising that the Viscount Heim is firmly standing on the side of Richard. This is not enough. This is a chubby viscount who looks like a little bull in estrus. The foot is called to send the masters of the Masters Association to the abyss to feed the devil, even more excited than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount did not slog the slogan, but directly brought out all the soldiers who could be taken out of the territory, even the most basic guards did not stay. . Not only that, but the Viscount even deducted a hundred eagle-flag knights belonging to the Duke of Glasgow, using their own safety as a bargaining chip to obey their orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Him, the strength of Marquis Allek, although not publicly announcing the camp, acquiesced to Luofu to join the Richard side, and put himself in the blood of the blood All the forces were handed over to Richard. Because of the relationship of faith, Luofu has been firmly tied to the chariot of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard is the most powerful and most surprising ally, actually Countess Ekaterina! The countess not only stood openly on the side of Richard, but also personally led five thousand elite warriors armed to the teeth to arrive at the station where Richard was stationed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Countess Ekaterina is in the name of protecting the future of the child in the belly. In any case, she can't give up the hope of having a child with a unicorn blood. This is still a reason to say that it can be said that the Countess is still claiming that she appreciates the bloodline of Richard. For the sake of the future of her children, she does not mind letting Richard take advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of Countess Ekaterina directly led to the number of aristocratic allies surpassing Richard’s private armies. This is not in line with Richard's thoughts, and it is blunt to say that if they do not listen to the command, it is not as good as Richard himself to fight alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganization of Richard is very simple this time. He broke up the aristocratic forces into a number of two thousand-scale troops, each equipped with a knight with a scarlet armor. . Whether you are marching or fighting, just listen to the knight. Richard personally led some of his troops and began to plug in Lausanne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of ​​Wangdu and Lausanne, the Masters Association is still gathering troops. The war came very suddenly. The coalition forces had many members. At this point in time, only two-thirds of the nobility who was able to reach the assembly area, or the main force did not include logistics and engineering, and rushed, and did not mobilize all the war potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of Richard is less than four hundred kilometers from Lausanne, and Richard progressed extremely quickly, and it took only four days to advance one hundred and fifty kilometers. Along the way, there were six territories of aristocrats of different sizes. The private lords of the local lords, whether they were mostly or not, whether the lord himself had a good name for war, was in front of Li Bingfeng. In addition to a direct vassal baron of the Duke of Hamilton, one of the three major dukes, when Richard sent the transit notice, he received the symbolic borrowing cost with great ease and was able to be intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
