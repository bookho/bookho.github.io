			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontal defeat of the coalition forces obviously makes Sinclair feel good, she is riding a donkey The lion walked freely in the battlefield full of corpses, and the lion lion occasionally bowed his head and squatted one or two on the ground. This big guy is obviously very picky, just willing to bite the knight or the corpse of the priests. If it is not a clergy, then it is lack of interest for any guy below level 10. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the lions went, the people who were collecting the spoils immediately panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beast will not look at each other because they have already fought for the blood of Sinclair. When it is occasionally irritating, it will randomly take a picture. Man, and he is playing in the claws like a toy. Under the poisonous claws attached to it, it is of course impossible for any person who is being manipulated to have a living path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great magician came to the lion and reported to Sinclair about the results he had just counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2,800-strong coalition army was annihilated, and only escaped less than 100 people, and there was no prisoner in this battle. When Saranwell escaped, the remaining coalition forces began to collapse, and then the one-sided slaughter. The coalition soldiers struggled to resist the end, and the guys in the blood-stained land were originally a group of thugs, and their men would naturally not be merciless. The Sinclair side lost 3,500 people and suffered more than half of the casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair waved his hand impatiently and said: "Those who just make up the number die will die, and it will not be worth the pain to die!" What happened to my town bear knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were six people killed in this war, four seriously injured, and two of them are basically unrecoverable." The magician answered with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, there are only thirty-one who can still fight?" Sinclair finally began to frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. In the past battles, the damage was a little faster..." The big magician’s words were only half, so that Sinclair waved Broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pondered for a moment and then sighed and said: "It seems that the game time is over, it is time to be serious. The last time we discussed, Whether the so-called legendary powers of this plane are true or not. The boundaries of the sanctuary can be divided at will, but the legend is different. Only when it reaches twenty levels can it gain powerful legendary ability. The ability to have legendary ability is called Legendary powerhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the legendary powerhouse of this plane does not have the legendary ability, but just like their sanctuary, but it is just a title." Perhaps the 18th, and even the 17th level will be called the legendary powerhouse.” The great magician guessed that this was also the original idea of ​​Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Sinclair shook his head, grabbing the lion's mane unconsciously with his hand, and then gently scratching it, thinking and saying: "Enter After the bloody land, I have killed two holy areas. Counting today is the third one, and the big priest also killed two. The time is not long, the area of ​​this area does not seem to be very large in the mainland. How come there are so many 16-level guys? And this position is not as big as the imagination, even I think the difference with Noland is not very obvious. Now I have vaguely want to upgrade again. Feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sorcerer was surprised: "That's great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cinclair is promoted to the 16th level, then in this era when the strongman almost determines everything, the meaning is extraordinary. The chances of winning a plane war will increase greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sinclair didn’t have much happiness, but frowned and said, “There is nothing good! This can only explain one thing. The upper limit of the power of this plane is indeed Above the legend, and the legends of the legendary powerhouses are also true! Destroy this enemies, and then it is likely to face the true power of this plane. Even if I am a third-order construction The knight can't resist the legend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we should start to integrate into this plane, or at least avoid the country with strong belief in the gods of mankind , slowly develop. After all, the gods of this position are our greatest enemy." The great magician thought about it and made suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the strategic choices when entering a new plane, but it is often a choice in a helpless situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you first enter the strange plane exploration, even if there is a limit of power transmission, for example, the 18th level of the secondary plane can only transmit 15th grade. In the past, the higher the level will cause the instability of the temporary passage, causing turbulence in time and space. However, with the support of the construction technology, the transmission team can basically compete with the strongest plane, and at least there will be room for resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many reasons for the failure of the plane exploration, the direct intervention of the local gods is the most, followed by the plane creatures using human tactics, and finally It is unlucky to enter a resource-poor plane, and there is not enough magic material to build a plane transmission channel, so that it is alive and dead on the ectopic plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that Sinclair has encountered a new situation, they have come to an unscheduled plane, and this Faro plane comes from all the signs that are currently in control. Look, it is very likely that it is the highest level of secondary plane, which makes her not only dominant in personal force, but even at an absolute disadvantage. Once you are targeted by the strong face, the end will definitely not be better. The best strategy now is to lurk down, slowly accumulate your own power, and then develop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the great magician did not understand her mood. As the owner of the dark sacrifice, Sinclair was very sensitive to time because she could not The temple gained extra life. So she is not willing to spend ten years in such a plane, this is a real ten years of youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it looks like there is no choice, so her mood is very bad. So Sinclair smiled, his expression was fascinating, and he wanted a lot of men and women. The great magician sinks in his heart and knows that this is a sign of her poor mood, so she is silent and does not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another great magician was late, but he did not see him clean up the battlefield before, nor did he see him chasing the enemy soldiers, but constantly caught Some people are asking what. In the end, he rushed all the way and couldn't wait to say: "Adult, I am sure, there is news of Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee? Which Richard?" Relaxing all the way, let Sinclair almost forget the original purpose of his trip to the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard Archimonde! I just inadvertently heard the name of Richard from the mouths of several people, even though this plane is the damn indigenous language. Like a bird, but they mentioned that a sanctuary swordsman bought from him a magical device that can greatly increase the power, and the kind that is installed on the human body. Adults, isn't that the magic pattern?" The great magician was very excited and continued: "I asked some people and learned that he was still in the blue water oasis for a while. Recently, he was known for his reputation in the blood-stained place. The matter about Richard is not It’s hidden, because the total amount of his trade is not small, and the trading target includes a lot of big people. As long as Richard is caught, we can get the coordinates back!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
