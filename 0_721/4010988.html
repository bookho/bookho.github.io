			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen sat quietly for a while, sighed and called in the old priest who was guarding the door and said, "Notify us, if... .. and Arkmund have a war. Let them be conservative, the harvest is not important, the life of our main fighter is the most precious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old god official's face flashed differently, and he naturally understood that this order is actually a passive avoidance. However, of course he would not doubt the Chinese decision, but limped away and conveyed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro, the messenger at the foot of Richard’s foot broke out at an unprecedented speed, flying at a speed of more than seven hundred kilometers per hour. However, under such a full force, the messenger can only fly for two hours, and then rest for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has been successfully promoted to the 12th order, and at the moment it is developing a new messenger. The new messenger is faster, has more people to carry, and is more durable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger carried the 1,500-kilometer flight and stopped. Richard's figure flashed, and it was already a few kilometers away, and then it was continuously transmitted. He suddenly crossed the mountains and rivers and went all the way. After about two thousand kilometers, a new messenger is already waiting for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha embarked on the messenger, immediately drank the magic to restore the potion, supplement the magic of consumption, and keep yourself in the best condition. After several relays in this way, Richard finally came to the northeast coast of the mainland. Going forward, it is the dark area occupied by the reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger waited in the same place, and Richard himself was hidden in the void and dive into the dark area. Shortly after entering, Richard suddenly felt that there were several strange fluctuations, and then he locked himself on himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly fell to the ground, and the strong wind that swelled when he fell fell thick snow, revealing a black mechanical body under the snow. It is only the size of a finger, extending four brackets, three on the ground, and one pen straight into the sky. The slender metal frame that stretched out into the sky constantly evoked the kind of fluctuations that detected him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over and took the little mechanic up. As a result, under the influence of the King of Metals, this little thing can still be deformed without any problems, and it quickly becomes a fighting machine. A small barrel is aimed at Richard's eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then there is no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a finger, Li has squeezed it into a ball, then the fingertips ejected a fire, and the small metal melted and evaporated, and finally only in his palm Leave a little silver metal that is smaller than the tip of the needle. If it is not for Richard's eyesight, it is really possible to ignore this little thing that is no different from dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out an empty vial and loaded it in. Then the figure flashed, and within a few tens of kilometers, a similar detector was found by tracking the detection fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard directly melted it and then ran to the next detector. He has discovered that there are such detectors everywhere in the snowfield, and one will be found every few tens of kilometers. Countless detectors have been woven into a large net, no wonder any creature can hardly sneak into this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a much stronger volatility locked in Richard. Richard looked up and saw a small black spot in the distant sky. It was a few small fighters and dozens of miniature fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most confusing thing is that behind the fighter group is a small transport plane a few meters long with several mechanical beetles. It seems that the reaper cherishes the resources very much, and even he does not want to let go of this flesh and blood, but also sent a transport plane to deal with the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspect is flashing and is close to the Reaper’s fighter. If you change the other strong, you may be shocked by the speed of Richard's raid, but the Reaper is the same as the Brood War, and there is never a word like panic or fear in the dictionary. Their barrels were immediately adjusted and directed at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was interested in a delay, and when the reaper began to shine in the barrel of the machine, it suddenly slid to tens of meters. However, he still tens of dozens of green smoke on his body, and dozens of small holes have been broken on the robe. Richard’s conscious reaction is almost at its best, but most of the reaper’s attacks still fall on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and saw that most of the body was only blackened by the skin, and only a few places showed obvious scorch marks. It seems that only the small fighters can effectively harm Richard, and those miniature fighters can't help Richard's powerful body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard also found that if the beam was exposed for too long, even a miniature fighter could hurt himself. And if you are attacked by a small fighter, it will cause him no harm if you take a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the beam of the Reaper fighter does not have the upper limit of speed like the magical light, but is so fast that even Richard can't dodge. The several attacks he had evaded were because the fighters reacted slightly slower and had not moved since they attacked Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the general understanding of the strength of the Reaper fighter, Richard is an instant movement, appearing in the Reaper fighter group, grabbing one directly Small fighter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a force on both hands, and the fighter was twisted into a screw. However, immediately after Richard’s sudden warning, he immediately threw out the small wreckage in his hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, the small warship that was destroyed actually blew itself, and the huge fireball has reached tens of meters in diameter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-destruction of a small fighter, the power has reached the level of nine levels of magic, seeing the two sides shrink. He was carrying a beam of light that had been shot and grabbed another small fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard learned to be smart, and his hands were screaming for a while, and the plane was directly pinched into a metal ball. This time it really didn't blew, but this fighter was ruined, and I don't want to analyze any secrets from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took the one-meter-diameter metal ball into the space equipment, and then took a shot on the sword with the space function at the waist. The backhand took out the Great Flame sword. The sacred light flashed, and the few miniature fighters around it were split into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee rushed to the last small fighter, and then there was a slight pain. He snorted and looked back, but he saw that the miniature fighters that had just been opened were still floating in the air. The intact muzzles were aimed at themselves, and they continued to blast a beam of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two fighter wrecks that are close together, and the various metal parts are constantly staggered as if they are living. Battlefield repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, and the understanding of these reapers was deeper. This kind of injury is fatal if it is placed on the creature, but for the reaper, it seems to be a repairable damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard ignored the dead and not stiff reapers, but rushed to the last small fighter, and a sword pierced it. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Holy Sword was slightly shocked, the small fighter was shattered and turned into hundreds of parts. With a wave of hand, Richard swept the parts into the space equipment, then rebelled into the group of fighters and killed those miniature fighters one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship that was originally intended to process Richard was not good at this time and had already begun to escape. However, its speed is too slow, even small fighters can not escape the pursuit of Richard, let alone the transport ship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also shook all the transport ships and mechanical beetles into parts and earned space bracelets. At this point, the reapers of this team were completely annihilated. However, Richard has little happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fighters are clearly at the bottom of the entire reaper battlefield system. In the analysis of the Doomsday Seal, Richard can also see hundreds of war machines of all kinds that are far above them. But these bottom-level fighters have also left a scar on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's fighters are very strong, roughly equivalent to the armor of the knight. For the general sanctuary, it takes a little more to break their defenses. But how much can the sanctuary under Richard's hands be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, their attack power is good, the most difficult thing is the attack speed. The reaper's high-energy beam is in full swing, and even Richard can't avoid it. Other strong people are less likely to dodge, and only hard resistance. However, when the number of reapers is enough, a fire can make the legendary strong hate. It is the same idea to build a knight against the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the reaper is doing it more thoroughly and even more. The number of reapers is more, the attack is more fierce, the strike is more precise, and the range is similar to that of the knight. How to deal with such an enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleaned up the battlefield, melted the wreckage of all the micro-machines with flames, and finally got a piece of silver metal with fingertips. Richard looked at the metal and continued to sneak into the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconnaissance fluctuations that constantly reverberate in the air have become the signposts of Richard. He marched toward the most influential places, and after defeating two small groups of fighters that had come to intercept, he finally saw something different, a base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bizarre base. It is surrounded by a piece of rectangular piece of nail, which is actually a muscle-like tissue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
