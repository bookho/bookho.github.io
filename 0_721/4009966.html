			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s gaze, he saw Xiaofang Dan sneaking Looking at the face of the middle-aged man, he said softly: "The Baron, I had been fighting with your father not long ago. So the relationship between our two families should be closer than now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the little baron to answer, his uncle sneered and said: "A pioneering knight also wants to have a close relationship with the baron's family? Wait until you become a jazz! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha faintly glanced at the little baron's uncle and said, "The pioneer is not a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Developing the Cavaliers is certainly not a knight!" Baron uncle laughed and said: "When you have laid down your territory and you have been recognized by the royal family, you are considered a true aristocrat. The Cavaliers are standard aristocrats!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled, did not explain, since he could not understand what he meant, there was no solution. Necessary. Richard's gaze was cast on the little baron and asked: "Baron, you don't seem to like me to build a castle in the present place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, No... No, it’s not my business to build a castle!” The little bard replied with some confusion. Although standing in front of the entire line of warriors, he did not give him even a sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man who had never spoken before said slowly: "Mr. Richard, the location where you built the castle seems to be somewhat inconsistent with the location you have registered. If I remember correctly, the land should belong to the Duke of the Wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and said quietly: "Yes, Just a few days ago, the Duke had just sealed me as a jazz, and that land was my territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man frowned and said, "The land The scope is much larger than a jazz collar. This is a bit wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one are you?" Richard asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man waved his hand and said, "Who am I not important..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li The investigation directly interrupted his words and said coldly: "If you are not important, shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s face immediately flashed a wrath, his mouth Zhang, want to say something, but finally silence, just a face full of clouds. His heart was deep, and he did not jump into Richard's language trap, shaking his own origins and positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this time, Richard naturally saw that this middle-aged aristocrat was the key to the change of the attitude of the Baron family. The uncle of the Baron Xiaofang Dan is now obviously in power, and the little baron who is still a child is completely vacant. As for the Lord of the Month, who was originally prepared to stay for a period of time when he left, there was no trace of it. In contrast, this was the most intriguing thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron, there are almost no people on my territory. And I need to hire workers, wood and stone to build a castle. Can you provide it?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baron’s uncle once again grabbed the front and smiled and said: “I am sorry, Master Richard, our family now needs to make a major overhaul of the dusk castle. So the material that can be separated is very limited. You see, we don't provide it, but the price is a bit expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly smiled and shook his head and said: "Ten times the price is still a bit expensive, huh, huh. Well, I already understand what you mean. Where is Pierce now, hand him over, I will leave immediately." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that things will be so easy to end. The little baron was a little pale, and his uncle’s eyes were flashing and he was in doubt. And Richard stood up and began to appreciate the ornaments and antiques placed in the living room. The Fontaine family has been inherited for hundreds of years, and naturally there are many boutique collections, vases on the shelves and oil paintings on the walls, all of which are valuable products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a vase and flipped it in his hands. Looking at the crystal vase worth thousands of gold coins was thrown in the hands of Richard, the little baron finally could not help but screamed: "Licha adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; With a bang, the crystal vase fell off from the hands of Richard and smashed on the ground. Richard turned his head and smiled at the little baron. He said, "The baron, do you want me to have something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Richard, everyone’s His eyes fell on the crystal fragments of the ground. You don't need too much knowledge of identification to see the value of this vase, but thousands of gold coins are missing with this crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baron is incoherent and does not know what he wants to say: "Licha...you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How am I?" Richard asked with a smile. During the speech, his hand was gracefully passed over the mantelpiece, and it was a gorgeous workmanship. The expensive magic clock slipped from his fingertips and slammed on the ground. Fortunately, the floor was covered with a thick carpet, and the bell shell just broke into it. But with the subtlety of magical equipment, a little damage can ruin the inner magical array. If it is repaired, it will not be a problem that can be solved by a few hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that thousands of gold coins flew away from Richard’s hands, the little baron’s uncle finally couldn’t sit still again, stood up and pointed at Li Look at the loud voice: "A little jazz, do you dare to scatter in the dusk castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha snorted and said faintly: I don't think, I just don't feel too good. In addition, I am really just a little jazz, but don't forget, I am still a pioneer. This gentleman, even if I am wild in the dusk castle, What can you do? Use force, or intend to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baron’s uncle wants to growl, but finds that he can’t say a word. Really want to use force? The entire Fangdan family has only one of his eleventh-level swordsmen. The guards behind the little baron look fierce, but only five or six. It is not much better than a group of sheep in front of the real strong. You must know that the person brought by Richard can be in the lounge more than ten meters away. Don't say that Gangde, that is, the barbarian guards who started the Weilai, he is somewhat afraid. This kind of talented race, the actual combat power is often higher than the surface level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you use it, you will be killed in a few minutes in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the war, he is arrogant and ignorant, and he does not think that with the remaining two hundred veterans in the family plus hundreds of new recruits just recruited, Richard started the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baron’s uncle was stunned, and then he turned his eyes to the middle-aged aristocrat who had been sitting still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original preset scenes are not like this. In their cognition, although Richard is a powerful magician, he is also a An aristocratic family of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
