Obviously, the enormous will of the tree carrying the life has gone far beyond the limits of this elf warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To communicate with the extremely large living body of the tree of life, you first need strong strength to withstand the impact of the will, and secondly, you need talent support. This will greatly reduce the intensity of the will impact. Individuals such as the Elf Warrior who do not have the two conditions can only carry the will of the tree of life in the way of overdraft vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard said: "However, I don’t think you cherish the lives of these guardians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Their duty is to guard me and sacrifice for me." The tree of life is justified, and the elves do not have the slightest objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "So don't say anything about destruction and killing. Our principles and perspectives are different. And I am not here and here." You are reasonable. Since it seems that you have the wisdom that other trees of life cannot match, then you need to convince me now, how can you not cut you down directly, and take away the tree of your life tree and take it away. Things have great value for us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tree of Life is silent for a moment and says, “What proposal do you have?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It depends on what you can do for us. We get your life tree and you can get a lot of things, such as strength, powerful artifacts, extra life, etc. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Richard’s heart was loose, and Nyris also showed a slight smile. This tree of life does have extraordinary wisdom, but the more wisdom, the more cherish life. The tree of life is indeed a rare sacrifice, more than the ordinary high-level sacrifice ceremony, but it is obvious that a living tree of life is more valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior in this time has exhausted his life, and the tree of life has not hesitated to throw him away, and another warrior who has been captured, Load the will on it. The whole process took a few minutes, which is actually the time for life tree to think and weigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I know the purpose of your arrival?" The Tree of Life asked slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is to conquer and use resources, not to destroy and endless plunder," Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life is silent again, when Richard reminds him: "The elves are not your guardians now, but my captives, they belong to me. So if you want to consume their lives endlessly, then I will take your heart away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life tree can no longer be silent, with low The gentle voice said: "If you live on my body, you can absorb the natural breath that I naturally release, so that I can increase my strength more quickly. In addition, I will gather the life of the forest, and condense into a spring of perseverance. This kind of spring water can make life last, and it can ensure that the life with extremely low fertility is born out of the next generation. The newly created perpetual spring is enough for ten elves to breed offspring. Of course, if it is a more powerful life, it needs to be more More sustainable springs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the room were slightly moved. Nyris immediately rushed to ask the key question: "What is the scope of the perpetual spring, and is there a limit to the power? For example, can you feed a certain kind of holy beast? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life replied gently: "As far as I know, the Fountain of Perseverance has no restrictions on use. Even if it is for the Holy Beast, it will have an effect, but The true sacred beast may need a lot, and perhaps a decade of decades or even decades of accumulation of perpetual springs is not enough for it to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A move, attached to Neris, whispered, "What do you want to do with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris replies: "Let the mother lay eggs!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening, Richard was equally impressed, but continued to say quietly to the tree of life: "This is not enough, what else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tree of Life seems to have been determined to compromise after hearing that Richard’s purpose is to conquer and utilize resources: “Every ten years, I Able to knot A fruit. This fruit contains a full life, and if it is taken, it will increase the natural life of about ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person immediately moved. The fruit of the tree of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a legendary treasure in Noland. It is extremely rare, and it has gradually been forgotten as the Elf tribes have withdrawn from the Noland continent. So that in front of the tree of life, no one remembers that there is such a thing that will exist in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in Noland, the ordinary life tree inhabited by the small elves is unable to produce the fruit of the tree of life. It seems that the unique environment of the Greenson plane allows such a tree of life to produce the fruit of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the spring of perseverance and the fruit of the tree of life are already higher than the value of the tree of life after cutting, because they can be produced continuously. And if you want to take the tree of life to the sacrifice, you must divide it to pass the door through the plane. The book of Time of Sands can be used as a temporary altar, but the strengthening of its body is far from being in place. The loss of grace is great. It is better to cut the heart of the tree and transport it back to Noland to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?" Richard continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Tree says: "My delicate branches are a great material for making natural sticks. But I can't pick too much. Those special branches can only be used at most every year. Picking two, otherwise it will cause damage to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extra harvest, and Richard remembers again and asks: "Can you let We get rid of the oppression of the forest will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. As long as you take a piece of my blade, you can be recognized by the forest within my ability." The life of Green Sen is no longer affected. This range is about one hundred kilometers. If you want to expand, you need to grow again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang quickly outlined the scope in his heart. The tree of life and the gate of the plane are about two hundred and thirty kilometers apart. If each one is in the range of one hundred kilometers, it means that there is a dangerous zone of about 30 kilometers in the middle. Unless he is carrying his holy unicorn, it is Sher that cannot safely cross the 30-kilometer zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scope is a bit small. Is there any other way to narrow the scope of the forest will?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...deforestation." After the tree of life was silent for a while, it gave such a suggestion. “When the forest is cut down, the will of the forest will shrink accordingly. If you can cut down a one-kilometer wide passage, then in the center of the passage, it will be a safe zone. In addition, the person who has served my blade, the forest The resistance of the will will increase dramatically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and felt that this was indeed a solution. Then he asked the last question: "How many life trees are there in this forest, is there a world tree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three trees in the life tree Fifteen, as for the great world tree, I can only feel that it exists in a distant place. But I don't know where it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark the location of these trees of life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life silently refused: "Sorry, this is beyond the limit of my life's instinct. If I Speaking of their position, they will immediately wither. There is an invisible connection between all the trees of life, I have to follow the rules. I can only reveal that there are three trees of life around your city, and I am One of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer forced it, saying: "Well, it is enough to say that. Is there a tree of life now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree trunk of life is a little trembling, as if experiencing an extremely painful process, and exploring the depths of the canopy after a while A branch, has been drawn to the front of Richard. At the end of the branch, a fist-sized cyan fruit falls in a group of green leaves. The peel is nearly transparent, and there is a slurry full of green color. It exudes a faint scent, and it smells refreshing when you smell it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fruit of the tree of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing it is like seeing an extra life of ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back first and looked around for a week, seeing that some people are still staring at the fruit of the tree, and some are thinking. Even Scher is still somewhat eager to try. Pamir's face was a little gray, and he shook his head helplessly. His magic has gone to seven or eighty-eight, that is, he wants to do something and be powerless. Lina is watching Richard, and the Dragon Master and Red Dragon can summon, which will become the biggest card of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Nyris and Agamemnon also came back, and they glanced at Richard, who shrugged and said: "Lee, This thing is first placed with you! Wait until you go back and discuss the distribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has stated that his men naturally put out other thought. Richard did not deny it, took out the magic box with the shadow drill, and gently took off the fruit of the tree of life and placed it in the box. When the fruit was taken off, the tree of life was shaking again, and it seemed to be painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fruit was taken, the tree of life did not take back the branches, but shook the branches and said: "This branch can be cut off as a natural staff. Raw materials, the leaves above have the ability to isolate the will of the forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the leaves, gave each one a piece, and then took The next few hundred leaves are placed in the sealed box and ready to go back to the elite soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard’s trip can be said to be rich, he looked up at the tree of life and said: "If other Green Sens know your situation, will it not? Will you come back to take you back, or destroy you directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
