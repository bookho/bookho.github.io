Although their auxiliary magic is weak, healing therapies can still be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf is the first wedge, and the Three Goddess is the second wedge, and such as Luofu and Clark, who have invested in the Eternal and Time Dragon, and The man who has deep cooperation with Richard is the third wedge. Now add all the nobles who have participated in the long-term plan and benefited from it. Therefore, Richard feels that as long as he does not make big mistakes, there is no power to drive himself out of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard smiled and watched Philen and the quicksand talk happily. In the eyes of Richard, these three priests are getting more and more lovely. In order to promote cooperation, they even brought a group of precious magic materials, dozens of pastors and hundreds of knights. At the request of Richard, the three god officials said that these people can completely obey the dispatch of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At such a big price, it’s just the right to teach in Richard’s territory, not exclusive rights, it’s exactly what Richard now looks like. Not worth the effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard from Noland, for the time being, does not understand that for the Faroese gods, faith is the foundation of everything, in order to compete for faith, In the long history of measuring 100,000 years, the gods have been fighting. Even the gods of the same camp, even the same gods in the extremes, there are no examples of black hands. In the long time, for the power of faith, there are countless new gods rising, and countless ancient gods have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the temple of the three goddesses, the greatest credit is the development of enough new believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally seated safely, listening to the pleasures of several priests chatting there. However, suddenly his face changed, Huo Di stood up, his face was blue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests looked at Richard with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and pressed the instinctive mood to maintain the calm of the tone. He said, "The distinguished priests are very happy that we have just been in the league." I have reached an agreement. But unfortunately, I am afraid I need to use your strength now. My enemy has already appeared outside the city. It will take less than half an hour and the battle will start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Fioren was shocked and quickly asked: "The enemy? Who are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "It is the Iron Triangle Empire. Dear priests, if you are willing to stand with me in the future, then all the pastors and knights will be handed over to me in this battle, obeying my command. If you are not willing to participate in the battle, then you still have a little Time is leaving here. The war is about to begin soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairn's face changed, hesitated for a moment, suddenly gnawed his teeth and said, "Okay! We fight." And will fully cooperate with your battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairn’s decisiveness makes Richard feel Some accidents, but he immediately smiled and said, "Thank you very much! You will not regret the decision today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard strode out of the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is leading the three priests to the barracks. She needs to break up the priests of the three goddesses and compile them with the priests of the party. The priests themselves are still visible, but the priests they bring are weak, and they can only play a role if they are used intensively. Liusha and Richard have been tacit for a long time. Just now, when Richard saw that he was somewhat calm, he knew that this was a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the search for the three priests to participate in the war or not, Richard has begun to continue to command in the same time. So when he got out of the house, the whole area was boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of soldiers quickly wear armor, constantly running out of the military camp, assembled in the playground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who belonged to the aristocrats were in a state of rest, and now they are required to prepare for all operations in five minutes. five minutes? At this time, a knight even wears armor! However, the Richards have been in the army for a long time, and everyone has become extremely sensitive to military orders and time requirements. Regardless of whether they can be in place in time, at least everyone has followed the order and immediately moved. The entire military camp was in chaos, the knights were looking for their own envy, and the enemies were looking for horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in less than two minutes, a team of soldiers squashed the neat formation on the playground. This is Richard's humanoid warrior, and their reaction speed is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the gate, the elf poet rushed over and shouted loudly: "Master! What happened? Why is it so urgent? Who? How many people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s face is very ugly: “It’s the army of the Iron Triangle Empire! It’s less than ten kilometers away, at least three. Wan! You immediately inform Luofu them, let them immediately mobilize all the mobilized soldiers in the city! In any case, first find a way to keep them out of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Three thousand!" Oral was shocked, he did not dare to delay, and immediately went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the alarm that represents the most critical situation was ringing, and the bells that seemed to be rushing and screaming without any rhythm spread throughout the Blue Water Oasis City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the entire oasis city is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, from the commanding heights, you can see a blue smoke cloud on the far side of the blue water oasis city. After a while, the earth began to tremble gently, and countless iron rides emerged from the clouds of smoke, rushing to the oasis on the red land! When the black-clouded cavalry rushed over, there was another infantry queue behind, and you couldn’t see the end for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, this army of silent rushing began to raise the banner! If you have an understanding of the formation of the Iron Triangle Empire, you will see from the flag that this is a two-cavity wing and two complete main army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few huge bats flying from the blue water oasis city, flapping their wings to the top of the attacking team, hovering back and forth, and the death eagle of the blood-stained land Interlaced from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of infantry trots all the way forward, and in the long march, their speed is incredibly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army side parked a team of extremely elite knights, surrounded by several luxury carriages. This is the command car of Salenville. At this moment, the emperor of the empire is standing on the roof of the car, carrying an alchemy telescope in his hands, and observing the blue water oasis in the distance. After a while, he put down the telescope and watched a team of wolf-like warriors rushing to the blue water oasis, and could not help but show a satisfied and confident smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell handed the alchemy telescope in his hand to the beautiful female assistant and said, "The enemy is already in chaos. It seems that they did not expect that I will appear here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the command car, there are more than a dozen generals. One of the generals immediately complimented: "His Royal Highness is like a god! This time you can catch the little boy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell suddenly shook his head, Say: "Not necessarily so easy! Don't be too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals are somewhat disapproving, and it feels that Salenwell is overly cautious. This is rarely seen from this prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Saranwell suddenly decided to hit the blue water oasis, and the army marched day and night, sweeping and capturing all the people who might leak in the way. After two days of rapid marching, this suddenly appeared outside the blue water oasis city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the soldiers are exhausted, the blue water oasis is the place where the major forces are divided. There is no city wall, and the current fortifications are still in Sinclair. The temporary build-up after the catastrophe can be imagined. It is also an army that has less than 10,000 pieces of Richard’s elite to the 30,000 empire. If they can’t win, then these generals can commit suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville used the arrogance of the soldiers, even Richard did not expect that after letting the other party wait for a while, Jalenville would have a thousand miles to go straight. Refers to the strength of the Chinese army, was immediately caught off guard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in addition to the madness of Sinclair, few people would directly attack the indiscriminate settlements of the blue water oasis, but now The advantage has turned into a hidden danger of Richard. Although most of the forces in the city are in an alliance with him, they have to guard against robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky god is still looking after Richard, if not a bat accidentally discovered the army of Salenville during routine patrols, he may When the army arrives outside the city, it will find enemy attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops retreating from the fire rock forest are just a confusing enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general suddenly looked up at the sky and pointed to the sky and said, "His Royal Highness, those few are actually bats! How can there be big daytime bats flying in the sky? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville looked up and looked at the sky with an alchemy telescope, saying: "Sure enough! It's not an ordinary bat, it's mostly a certain one." The magician's magical pet. But the number is a little more... no matter how much, come, give me a shot! If the magical pet dies, it will be a heavy blow to the magician itself."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals took off the giant bow hanging on the horse, suddenly burst out of the sacred rank of the sacred, Zhang bowed the arrow, and in a blink of an eye several arrows screamed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats in the sky have slammed down, and only one of the largest forms of response is extremely fast, and instantly pulled up, letting an arrow of almost killing. The bat continues to climb and rises above the kilometer. In this way, even the magic tracking arrow can't threaten it, but it doesn't want to see the details of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards collected the bat bodies that had fallen and gave them to Salenwell. Salenville turned over and over to check for a while, but did not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue water oasis city is already in chaos, countless people are running around, the road is full of carriages. People who keep getting news want to escape from Oasis City. Although there is no danger in the bloody land, the vast and complex terrain is the best defense. Escaped into the depths of the blood-stained land, that is, 100,000 troops have been unable to search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
