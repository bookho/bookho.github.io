			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness is not a hindrance to the girl, she looks around and shows her face Confused, she vaguely felt that something was calling herself, and this thing seemed very important to her, letting her instinctively want to respond, but the voice was very vague, and now she woke up from her dreams. But I can't find the source of the summoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water flower sat alone in the dark for a moment, and the swaying in the heart gradually dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, not only the gods of Faro, but many powerful people with unique talents also sensed the existence of magical souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of Richard just passed by, and then he was overwhelmed by the great joy, and the hands that stretched out to the frame were a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the structure is picked up, the above light gradually dissipates, but it can still be seen that every line of the circle is halo. That rich spirituality and vitality is simply a spurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a big one, it’s called a silent voice, but this fact is so important that even the first time I began to doubt my insight, and once again carefully confirmed the structure of the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repeated inspections, Richard finally believed that the spirituality of the King of Iron was finally assimilated by the forces of construction, and it was completely transformed into a new magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a structure with a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Noland, this soul-like structure has a name, holy decoration, yes, any soul-like structure will be returned Into the fifth-order structure, which is the sanctuary, that means, now, Richard is already a holy constructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Constructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the spirituality transforms into a magical soul in the structure and vibrates the rules of the entire Faro plane, Richard is already a holy constructor. Perhaps Richard is a little worse than the traditional St. Architect, because he is not a legendary mage, but when he succeeded in making the fifth-order sacred costume, the original shortcoming turned into a daunting Wherever, it has not become a sacred architect in the legendary stage, and there are very few entire Noland history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the magical soul in the structure, it is supposed to be a detailed test of the specific function of the structure. The functions of the ordinary structure are precisely fixed at the design stage, even if the carrier and the structure of the structure are different, the finished product There will be differences in quality, but the fluctuation range is also limited, and it will not affect the basic performance of the structure. However, the holy structure cannot apply this law. Each magical soul is different, and the specific ability is also very different, even using the same There are also fundamental differences in the finished products of the drawings, just as St. Peter’s Armed Forces series, the seven angels have different abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, however, Richard’s heart could not calm down anyway, his thoughts fluttering around, and many past events, all of which were disturbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, all kinds of thoughts are set on Su Hailun, the legendary Master has too much influence on his life, perhaps second only to Gordon and Elani, that One night, the glorious shadow made Richard unforgettable, and today, Richard finally feels that he can truly stand in front of Su Helun, equal and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of ordinary legendary wizards, the identity of Richard Chad is much higher than the other, but Su Helun is different, she is always special One, the legend is just a starting line, a gate, and a vast world behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha decided that when the Faro war situation was finalized, it was time to go to the dark blue for the first time, to see the legendary mage, the day of fate. He once made a promise to explore the secret of the deep blue sigh of the six-level construction in the infinite plane, but until today, he really has the strength to make this promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, Li’s mood slowly calmed down and began to test the function of this structure. He unloaded the natural lord’s body and put it new. Load the structure onto yourself and begin to experience the new build. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit is derived from the king of iron, and after transforming into a magical soul, it also maintains the original ability to manipulate metal, but this manipulation is directly on the level of regular power. Execution is higher than ordinary metal abilities and does not know how many levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, this construct is equivalent to the power of the rule of the Iron King, albeit only a basic metal manipulation, and only a small part of it. But it does not detract from the power of this structure. As long as this structure is loaded, it is equivalent to an additional basic legendary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original natural lord of Richard’s body has been modified several times, and it has become an important part of everything. This structure allows Richard to have the ability to walk in all kinds of terrain and to make the special environment unfavorable to Richard. The impact is reduced to a minimum. In the field of extinction, it can be said that only the third-order natural lord has been playing a silent role, and the effect cannot be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After replacing the new structure, although there is a loss in the effect of movement and environmental addition, as long as there is metal in the surrounding environment, Richard will get Great convenience, and most of the known planes contain more or less metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This installation, because of its source of inheritance and its own characteristics, Richard decided to name it the king of metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly slowed up the construction, and a light cyan color appeared on his hand. At this moment, his heart suddenly moved, so he walked out of the room and opened it. The courtyard door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless knight walked into the courtyard and lazily leaned on the door and said, "I heard that you made a great thing, I specifically Let’s take a look.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, I know that it’s impossible to get through the seemingly omniscient no-face, just want to say something, suddenly the ground Shake, as if a giant is coming to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless knight screamed and said, "Look, some people smell the smell coming over, guess who is coming, the gods are still legendary ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is shaking more and more, such as the ancient mammoths of more than ten meters in the same head are striding, and that wild and fierce momentum is skyrocketing. From now on, when people rushed, they made people breathe badly, but Li looked at it, but could not see any monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not worry too much, but Enron chatted with the faceless knight, and even today, even the Faro gods sent him down, Richard Not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibration is getting worse and worse, the wildness makes Richard very familiar, and then Richard’s face becomes more and more weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the mountains and the sea appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Baroque barbarian are closed. They all rely on the nose to guide the way, and they come all the way to Richard. This scene gives Richard a feeling of deja vu, but now Richard is not the unresisting force. The young man is the great sacrifice of Uzzarazu, and at this moment he also wants to control the actions of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the mountains and the sea are extremely heavy, and the girl’s consciousness is still in sleep at the moment, relying on instinct to act, the momentum does not converge at all, if it is closed, Richard will also realize that there is an ancient beast that is coming to himself, because this breath is truly true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient spirits of the girl exudes a rich and pure atmosphere to such a degree that even the faceless knight can't help but admire: "It is a rare blood force." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looked a little surprised at the faceless, in the impression of Richard, she seems to know everything, omnipotent, rarely see her what Something moved, this is the first time I saw her with such feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pantheon of the Calando barbarian came straight to Richard, the little nose kept moving, and she eventually could not resist her desire for the magical soul. All the way to find Richard came here, and then directly hit the body of Richard, pushed him back to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her like this, Richard was a little bit dumbfounded and forced to knock on her head a few times, which made her wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got something, it smells good." The mountain and the sea plunged into Richard's arms and sniffed, then said "But it's still your taste is better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face like a smile, said: "This little guy is very bad in the future, be careful of her long After eating you, you still have to eat her now, so that you can be depressed later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face with pun, Richard snorted I will ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the voice of the Ogre Lord was heard not far away: "Master, have you made any good things and can eat?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a familiar voice, and he still found the source of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face seems strange, but at this time, she saw the splash behind the ogre lord. This time, even no face is not calm, said to Richard: "You are amazing, actually It’s not just luck to find so many guys with horror talents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This” Richard’s stunned, some initial memories creep into my heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is right, it can sense the fluctuations of the rules when the magical soul was born. It is a guy with extreme talent. Such a person is almost only relying on Excellent talent, plus a little luck, you can enter the legendary gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Splash may require a little luck, but it will be legendary anyway, and the Ogre Lord is equal to half the foot has entered the legendary door. In the end, it is the mountains and the sea. The full-scale of Calando seems to be a legendary strongman as long as he has enough to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with these three people, Richard feels that his talent is simply not good enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no longer a matter of luck to find so many powerful followers. It’s just a matter of follower’s talent, if you don’t consider it The mysterious demon, Modred, Richard has indeed completely surpassed Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a figure quietly emerged in the heart of Richard, it was sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the water is found, and the original followers are found, the sand is present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, the sands that had already had the name of dawn at that time must have been seen in the long river of time, and prompted Richard to choose these few Followers who did not stand out at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Richard has already known that the rules of time are the most fair and ruthless. If you want to get something, you will have to pay the corresponding price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard knows that from that time, the sand has been silently paid, the god of time and the dragon of eternal, able to In the long-term flow of time to understand the future of the sand, everything done is not without reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
