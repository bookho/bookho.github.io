			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, when the Thunderbolt received the magic pattern, it was obvious The extra magical scroll of the convection sand was very unexpected. Although the quicksand has repeatedly stressed that because the dignity of the god of courage is inviolable, the ordinary person to start the scroll of the magic is equivalent to touching the power of the true God, and it must pay a great price. But the more she warned, the more persecutive the expression of the half-orc with blood in the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Thunder Hammer personally selected 20 half-orc warriors for Richard as the last paragraph of the deal and a thank you to the three magic scrolls. These soldiers are almost one-third of the young and elite of the entire bloodstone tribe, and without these three reels, Richard's estimate is only a team of old, weak and sick soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to really get these fighters, you have to wait until the thunder hammer kills the fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the day has not been lit up, the thunder hammer has been staring at the stars for a long time, leaving the bloodstone camp, and embarking on the road of revenge alone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Thunder Hammer left the camp, Richard took the newly acquired Orc Warrior and cleaned the disabled party on the Mark site again, and completely occupied the spring eye. . With the precedent of Mark, and seeing that the Thunder Hammer and Richard are temporarily united, Hu Li, Karon and others have remained silent with great interest, and the default is the replacement of the blood stone camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha began to study the rumors of the red Cossack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Cossack is not a simple name, nor a person, but a code name for a business group, and is ranked in the entire bloody land. One of the top business groups. The business groups that can stand and flourish in the blood-stained land are actually more terrible than the fierce thieves, horses and even orcs, sand people and barbarians. If it is not more fierce than all the murderers, how can it survive in the blood-stained area, or even grow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Cossack is one of the largest slave traders in the blood-stained area, and has a powerful escort. This is a escort with more than 5,000 warriors. The number can be compared with a count, but it is killing in bloody places all the year round. Its combat power is far beyond the private army of ordinary nobles. In the slave business group, the most powerful combat power is not in the escort team, but in the slave team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important slaves in the blood-stained highlands are the barbarians and the sand people who are strong and war-torn, and occasionally the orcs will be caught. The masters of the slaves who have captured the slaves all the year round are like clouds, and they are all bloodthirsty guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His striker meets one of the external escorts supported by the Red Cossack. Said to be the external guards, in fact, most of the time they are doing the work of horse thieves. The knight wearing a red armor is also a little famous. He mentioned that Hawthorn Hook and his team are still known to many people around the bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palm of his hand, a small flame emerged, lit a few pages of red Cossack information, and then looked at it into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Cossack, it seems to be a good goal, and it just happens to have a big name. If you grab me a hundred horses, then I will simply kill Falling away!" Richard thought, waving a gust of wind and blowing the paper ash out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five days, the Thunderbolt came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
