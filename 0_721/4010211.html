At this moment, Richard suddenly had a slight lips and gave her a sigh of relief! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A colorless, transparent flame blows out of Richard's mouth and squirts straight to Sosler's eyebrows. Sussell’s heart suddenly had an indescribable chill, and the horror came to the extreme, screaming, and a short knife in his left hand, and the double knife crossed in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double knives have just been set up, the magic light is suddenly on the blade, the double-knife blade is shaking, then the two squeaking sounds, the short knife attached The magic is all bursting, and the blade is covered with cracks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel is desperately throwing a pair of knives that have been broken into countless pieces, and then completely refrain from ignoring it, directly throwing it down, rolling it on the spot, this Only the attack of the flame was flashed. The transparent flame was swept over the sorrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel was horrified, just propped up, but found that Richard did not know when he was standing by his side, the long knife extinction was placed in her Neck side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the castle, the old bear Peter’s face is extremely ugly, and a middle-aged man behind him is crying out loudly: “Does he come from a terrible domain? Battlefield!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are there so many territorial battlefields? He is only 14th level!" The Duke of Bear Peter yelled. Those who can stand on the battlefield in the absolute field are the strong people of the sanctuary, and some young people who are not afraid of death ran to open their eyes, but they all need family or division escort, and their strength must be at least 16 or 17 or otherwise The grade difference is enough to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart is amazed, although this is common sense, but he always feels that he has nothing to say. Richard's way of defeating Soleil is simple and straightforward, but it is incredible. Afterwards, it is the only way to spend the least cost and knock down Soslerle as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of combat is a common feature of the powerful who survived the battle on the ground in the field and succeeded. For monsters that can survive in places like the absolute battlefield, the level is not that important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his wrist and used the extinction to slap the face of Sosrel, faintly said: "You go back and practice for two years and say it! The time is long, no Urgent. I will wait for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard’s long knife was extinct, and he looked up at the Duke of Bear Peter and suddenly laughed. Dao: "I really don't care about Dario! If I change me, I can't stand there like I don't have anyone. By the way, Qi Qi is doing well in my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Bear Peter is thicker, and at this moment a face is swollen into a purple sauce, both hands clenched, and the whole body is shaking. No one of the bears dared to look back at him, fearing that he would be angered afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee once again pointed to the Duke of Peter Peter, sneer: "Remember! I am waiting for you in the Greenson plane, don't let me wait too long. Otherwise, you will regret it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he left, the entire floating island of 7-7 was still dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Richard was speaking on the floating island of the Bear Peter family quickly spread throughout the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility who heard the news reacted differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Duke of Mensa was ill-treated to death by the Duke that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joseph family is seemingly calm, but originally only read the book, appreciate the sunset, and prepare to survive the final stage of life. Things, silence for a whole night, the next morning, he left the family floating island, tidy, leading the soldiers to start investing in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the report from the courtier, Philippe just said: "The kid of the Archimonde family is finally showing his teeth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evaluation of the emperor quickly spread. Richard is even more famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many nobles are eager to hope that the Bear Peter family can be bloody, really hit the Greenson plane, try Richard’s tooth decay More sharp. Now Richard has publicly acknowledged that Sinclair was killed by him, and that the long knife was extinct in his hands, and that the venue of the battle was designated as the Greenson plane. This is one of the two most important planes that the Schumpeter family originally valued. If the coordinates of the plane are captured, they will not be able to find it. No one will believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what is disappointing is that the Schumpeter family has no movement since then. They did not convene the strong, nor did they mobilize the army from the planes and territories, and did not reveal any intention to fight against Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are helpless, and they also admire the thickness of the Duke of Peter Peter. In this context, Sosrel jumped into the field of vision. Originally, Schneider's double flower was only a higher-level character than the vase, and Sinclair had been in the plane war since very early, and her fame was far above Soller. After the death of Sinclair, the bear flower double flower was gradually forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after this battle, Sosrel once again became the topic of the aristocrats when talking, as the only person in the Schumpeter family who dared to challenge Richard, she got A wide range of praise and recognition. Of course, in addition to praise, the nobility will not forget to add: "It is a pity that the Schumpeter family does not have a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has no time to go Concerned about the movement of the Schumpeter family, he is only dealing with various matters at his own pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was about to enter the Greenson plane, he got another good news. Deep blue has made significant progress in the study of the Faro dwarf gunpowder, and the formula has been improved. The newly formulated gunpowder is more powerful and more stable. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a reward for Richard’s generosity and helping Deep Blue maintain a fiscal balance, the Grey Dwarf was a rare trip to send a space box with ultra-long-range transmission. It contains a cubic meter of new gunpowder with a thousand alchemy detonators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the gunpowder, took the magical material that he spent nearly half a million coins during this time, and returned to Greenson surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson Plane has been a month away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Richard did was to distribute the structure and immediately established a team of ten builder knights. This is already a small scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Richard spent a lot of time studying the characteristics and best use of the gunpowder in the Greenson plane environment. When Black Gold sends gunpowder, it also includes detailed features and instructions for use. The first use of these gunpowders is to deal with those rock and wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The properties of gunpowder are very stable and will hardly explode in normal times, but will be detonated when a severe impact reaches a certain level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first applied a small piece of gunpowder on the rock, and then let the heavy armor warrior slammed down, only to hear a roar! The heavy armor squatted back and bleeds with both hands. The rock tree trunk has a large pit, leaving only a small part to be connected. Another heavy armor went up to two axes and fell down the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but looking at the soldier who bombarded the gunpowder, the power of these improved gunpowder was greater than expected. In the next few days, Richard let go of his hand to study the usage of gunpowder. After repeated experiments, it was really derived from many ridiculous usages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final method is to first drill a small hole in the rock and then insert a thick steel bar such as a hole. A gunpowder is attached to the front end of the steel strip. In the end, a heavy armored warrior smashed at the end of the steel bar, and the gunpowder would explode in the center of the rock, and the power was enough to blow the rock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a logging warrior can blow up hundreds of rock woods a day, which is several times more efficient than when using a logging axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is finally assured that he will let his people do it. He put himself in the magic lab and kept on sleeping for days. He just painted the whole heart. During this time, only Qi Qi was helping and serving around. When the seventh day, Richard did not know how many times he failed, he finally succeeded in making a new magic pattern. Qi hugged up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard discovered that Qi Qi seems to have lost a lot of weight and looked a lot, and could not help but apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this structure? It costs a lot!" asked Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, this configuration failed once, that is, the material worth 300,000 gold coins was scrapped. Any small mistake, if you want to correct it, is thousands of gold coins. The small mistakes accumulate more, and there is no way to correct them. In the end, I can only give up the whole structure and start over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the material consumption of the entire structure is consumed, even if Richard does not make a mistake, it is more than double the wild barrier set. This is just a pose! Calculated, Richard's hand-held value of nearly two million magic materials, because the trial production of this structure has been nearly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now only hopes that this structure will be as powerful as its description. But in any case, Richard successfully mapped out the structure itself is a milestone, because it is a third-order construction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, one foot has stepped into the threshold of the big framer, and from the level of construction officially and the Holy Alliance Royal Architect Lu Nuoping. Moreover, the design of this structure is exquisite and complicated, and the drawing difficulty is far above the ordinary third-order structure. If it weren't for Richard's precise talent and solid horrible skills, there would be no way to master it in such a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the structure in his hand, and said for a moment: "The name is magical."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic armor?" Qi Qi repeatedly recited this name, and finally determined that she had never heard of such a structure, so asked: "Is this designed by you? Is it a few orders? Construction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
