			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of Licha ignited a blue fire and turned into a meteor. He even broke an eye directly and rushed into the giant beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the volcanic world, Tiramisu led hundreds of night elf warriors, and was struggling to push the reaper Metal ball, roll it to a new giant pit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of the crater burned with a blazing flame, turned out to be a giant melting pot. The temperature of the furnace flame is extremely high. When the pit is waiting, the night elf warriors who have reached the strength of the sanctuary have been completely unable to withstand and all retreat. Only the ogre sweated and screamed, and the giant ball rolled for the last few seconds and pushed into the furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnace slowly closed, the core temperature suddenly increased several times, and the metal ball melted immediately. Under the traction of the force field, most of the metal was taken out as waste, and only a small amount of silver ember essence was left and sent to another smaller furnace deep in the heart of the furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this furnace, the embers that can resist the destruction of the Star of Destruction actually began to decompose! During the decomposition process, the essence of the embers is constantly annihilated, but every time you annihilate it, it will release an indescribable amount of energy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus suddenly vibrates, and the seven giant crystal columns scream, and the frequency of launching the beam is immediately increased by half! The entire SF's hood has become more sturdy, resisting the wave of raging attacks of the reapers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven crystal columns suddenly merged into one, turning into a blazing white light column, banging on a reaper monster! The general body of the mountain was suddenly pierced by a beam of light, leaving a horror hole with a diameter of nearly 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another giant beast, after a bombing of a dark red fireball, Richard immediately flew 100 meters and hid a non-stop creep. Behind the meatballs. The fireball suddenly burst into a dazzling light, and then turned into a fireball with a diameter of several hundred meters. The pure high temperature and shock wave shredded the flesh and blood within a kilometer, and it cleared a huge space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the body of the giant beast, the power of nuclear bursting is greatly enhanced, and it is more effective than destroying the blue fire. However, Richard kept sprinkling a large blue fire. The flame from the Star of Destruction burns for a very long time, and when it goes down, it can burn a deep hole. And metal parts can't stop the burning of blue fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the black hole could not be launched in the dark side of the world, and Richard lost one of the most aggressive means. Otherwise, if you open a black hole directly in the monster, you can completely destroy it. Now, the release of Richard’s lethality is also limited in power. Even if it is a nuclear burst, I am afraid that even dozens of people will be able to burn such a huge behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harvester's behemoth design is the same as the Starship, with a decentralized layout, without any core or important areas. If you want to kill it completely, you have to bombard it and burn it until it is completely ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus is the best solution to the weapon of the void level. On the floating world, there are constantly followers who come in and out with the bombardment of the reapers, drag the wreckage to the floating world and throw it into the furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enormous power generated by Essence has completely transformed FS to become a war machine. Seven giant crystal columns will be bombarded every few seconds, each time bombardment Leave a terrible blank area in the Reaper fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the number of reapers is too much, and their constant bombardment makes vagrants unbearable. Floating islands flying in the periphery, each of which is a defensive node, supports the operation of the shield. However, the reaper quickly discovered this and began to concentrate on the bombardment of the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the screams of strangeness suddenly sounded in the void, and the giant beast in the distance shook all the way, suddenly squirting a piece of metal with a foot of ten meters square. Fly over nearly 100 kilometers at an unimaginable high-speed moment and bombard it on a floating island! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a huge kinetic energy bomb, instantly caused an earth-shattering big bang, the floating island directly destroyed, and only two floating islands nearby Small half. The whole floating world has been slammed back by the mighty momentum and rolled back several kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control room, no face sullen, full of artifacts suddenly burst two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is Richard! It's not reliable!" she complained, swaying the crystal floating around, and then squatting in the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven crystal giant columns turn an angle and then light up at the same time! The seven-color beam merges into one in the void, once again piercing the body of the behemoth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through-hole damage of several hundred meters in diameter is also a heavy injury in the monster. It kept screaming, squirming, trying to repair the wounds on the body, and it was difficult to launch a terrible attack just enough to smash the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant beast suddenly rolled up, and the body continued to break, and a hot fire was ejected in each split! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew out of one of the wounds and looked back at the behemoths that were constantly rolling. No matter how struggling the behemoths, they still inevitably fall into the sea of ​​fire and are completely ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief, and it was surprisingly difficult to get rid of this monster. He almost burned the inside of the body of the behemoth, and this completely killed the big guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hadn’t had time to breathe, and the other behemoth shot a few rays of corrosion. Richard cursed with some annoyance, activated the blue fire again, and slammed into the eyes of the behemoth and rushed into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this flesh and blood maze, Richard progressed rapidly, and the nuclear burst and destruction of the blue fire alternated. Sometimes even at the expense of consumption, the release of nuclear meltdown with the silence of the Three Realms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! Can you hurry up, do you need to do a lot of rotten meat?" No face is big in Richard's consciousness, loud volume I have to be a little dizzy in Richard. Apparently she was extremely dissatisfied with Richard's progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rotten meat you said is a mountain! I can only blow up a mountain at a time!" Richard replied. His nuclear burst and destruction of blue fires are extremely rare magics with range attacks and super-high damage, but the Reaper's behemoth is too big to be desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only six floating islands on your floating world now! Damn, another shot! Hello, you don't want a floating island." "Wu Shide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how do you make me get up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think I want to do what Helenen does!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the dark side! I can't fold the portal, I am not a star, I don't have such a strong ethnic space talent. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have the title of the space lord, isn't it? Oh, I forgot, you are the time lord. You can't fold the portal, you can always find something to fold? Do you want a few black holes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the dark side! I can't make a black hole!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like this, with no face In the constant quarrel, Richard once again killed a behemoth. When he rushed to the third behemoth, the war had set the tone. The reaper without the behemoth is not enough to break the defensive system of FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel beam constantly sweeps the remnant of the Reaper, and the energy of the fauna is always abundant. It flies at high speed on the battlefield, constantly collecting the reaper wreckage and putting it into the furnace. Decomposing the enormous energy produced by the essence of the embers makes the defensive hood of the faucet almost irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last behemoth was turned into ashes in the blue fire, the void was full of fragmented reapers. No face to face with the floating world is flying around the battlefield, collecting all the scattered debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li couldn’t take a break and quickly flew to the island, behind the blue star, his ultimate destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star screen blocks the invasion of chaotic rules and also shields the internal situation. Before entering the star screen, Richard suddenly hesitated. He was afraid that he could not find Su Helen after the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he smiled a bit, or walked into the star curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the star, there is an empty space where hundreds of plasma balls float. In the center of the space is a stone platform, Su Hailun is lying quietly on the stone platform, as if in the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, new plasma balls are generated and can't move in the air. In a small space, the energy is amazingly abundant. And Su Hailun's body seems to be gestating an energy storm, and there will always be a huge amount of energy coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just that, it still seems to be insufficient to stop the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush to awaken Su Hailun, but meditated, his eyes sweeping through every inch of space under the stars. Here, he feels that there is another breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
