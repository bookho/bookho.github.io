Martin smiled and said an answer that made Richard look pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, destiny! You appeared in St. Louis at this time. It is the arrangement of fate. It is also able to explode my holy book, which means that you have the ability to have destiny. Not all encounters are coincidences, Mr. Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, not all encounters are coincidences. But since God's prophecy is difficult to confirm my whereabouts, how can I believe this is fate." Richard said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said sacredly: "Destiny is not in the hands of God. Sometimes, the gods must also succumb to the arrangement of fate. In destiny In the face of power, we either resist or obey. Before the power is resisted, it is obvious that the latter is the right choice. It is an arrogant and worst way to ignore fate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not frowning. Martin's words seem invulnerable. The key point is that it is difficult to prove that it is wrong. If you change someone, you may refute Martin unceremoniously. The logic is also very simple, Richard can not falsify, Martin can not prove. However, Richard could not refute because he thought of the sand that might have been walking in the dark area at the moment. Including Vatican, it is believed that the flow of sand to the dark area is an inevitable fate and cannot be undone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is fate? Standing on the level of Richard, you can already look directly at the plane gods, but the arrangement of the eternal and the dragon of time is a fate in his view, because it is difficult to escape and cannot compete. But if you stand at the level of eternal and time dragons, will you also see the fate of the arrangement? Going up again? It's like a spiral, hovering upwards, never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pondered for a moment and said to Martin: "Thank you for your help, but you also caused a huge loss to me. So this time we are two Clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marstad shrugged and said, "It seems that you still don't believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can't believe you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then wish you good luck. Oh, yes, I almost forgot one thing! Can these pieces of sacred objects tell me after the crystallization of the divine nature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Richard, this is a strange request. Moreover, this seems to be suspected of blasphemy. As the cardinal of the Church of St. Hui and the candidate of the Pope, Martin reasonably said that he should turn a blind eye to such behavior. Why is it so enthusiastic? Standing in the position of faith, seeing you and not taking action is sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled: "I don't know if you condense God." The method of sexual crystallization does not care. But I am very interested in your efficiency. There are counts of sacred objects, and I have seen them. So the amount of divine crystals that you condense exceeds our method, then we There is a basis for cooperation. I will send some sacred objects at intervals, and you will condense them into a crystallization of divinity. We divide more than our original parts, how do you look?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes slightly and asked: "How much divine crystal can your way produce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About so much. "Speaking, there is a milky white crystal in the hands of Martin. It can be seen that the mist-like energy is flowing. It is the divine and radiant power and the divine crystal, which is about ten units." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said quietly: "I can only say that I try it, but I can't make sure. And what I can condense may be the divine nature of no attributes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's better, we don't lack the crystallization of divine attributes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The people who care about each other shook hands and even reached the deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin and the church secrets left in a carriage. They didn’t even have a driver, but the secret agent took on the role of a car. But if any robbers on the road look at the carriage, the ending is definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Martin squinted with his eyes closed and a pleasant smile on his face. The cardinal position of the secret ambassador is actually above Martin, but he is very respectful to Martin, and he does not hesitate to be a driver. At this time, he is respectfully asking: "Adult, do you really want to trade with Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin lazily said: "What's wrong with us? We can all benefit, and now the sacred objects pile up like mountains, and the warehouse can't be put down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The cardinal hesitantly said: "But those are sacred objects after all, we are God's servants, and they can be said in the process of dealing. Richard is not a believer, it seems to be contrary to the canon's plain text..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rule is dead, and that is not a god. As long as we are seeking benefits for our Lord, the principle remains the same, then it is ok. What does not matter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal said: "Yes, adults. Only you have the ability to master the rules flexibly. I can only do it according to the established rules, at least not Error."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin praised: "It is wise to do things within your ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, your mood seems to be good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie laughed and said: "That is when Finally, I sent out the book of the disaster, which is naturally a lot easier. And I have a hunch that Richard will bring us a big surprise in the crystallization of divinity."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said is...the holy book?!" The cardinal was very astonished. The power of the Holy Scriptures in Martin's hands is extremely powerful, and it is one of the seven artifacts of the Church of St. Hui. But Martin called it a book of disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Scriptures are just the appearance of it. Its true face is actually a strange thing called the book of the disaster. Hey! The dark Messiah must also be this guy. I saw this. I didn’t check it at the time. I actually took his trap and took the book in my hand. Now it’s hard for me to get rid of this trap and I can slowly pick it up in the future.” Martin said this In the words, the face was unexpectedly chilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The book of the disaster, has a great impact on you?" The cardinal carefully asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a very powerful force, and this kind of power we may play out is only a small part of it. But just because it is too strong, it has already reached Beginning to influence the degree of fate. In other words, because its holder has a strong force, it will stand on the opposite side of fate. Even if it is me, it will not change hopes for the outcome of confrontation with fate. So these years I have been careful and I have found the opportunity to send it out now." Martin was impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it not okay to send it directly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie shook his head: “This book of catastrophe has magical power, and it’s very demanding for the holder’s approval. To control it, and to transfer it, you need to meet the requirements of the rules. It is not necessary to simply send it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal is shocked at this time. Also happy, Martin confided such a big secret to himself, apparently he has already gained his trust. After sending away the book of the disaster, Martin’s chances of becoming a pope will increase, and his future destiny will naturally take another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So congratulations to adults!" Cardinal did not lose the opportunity to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie smiled and said: "The matter of divine nature will be handed over to you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he closed his eyes and began to think about things related to the dark Messiah. The cardinal is full of surprises at the moment. The crystallization of divinity is not only wealth for him, but also represents tremendous power. As a person who is in charge of the divine crystallization of the supervisor, the occasional leakage of one or two units of crystal between the fingers does not cause much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the Black Rose Castle, Richard came to a defensive secret room and began a piece of inspection on the shelf. Things. The sacred objects obtained from the Church of St. Hui are placed here, and even the scriptures that have been exhausted have been used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Richard picked up was the old holy grail, while examining and recalling every detail after seeing Martin. At the end of the day, Martin revealed the true purpose: the crystal of divinity. The divine crystallization of sacred objects can actually provide the strong one with the opportunity to touch the rules. This is an important means for the strong to assist in the breakthrough when attacking the legendary realm. Just wanting to do so is costly and has serious consequences. First of all, the divine crystal is extremely expensive, and the only way that Richard knows is to exchange it from the eternal and the dragon of time. It is natural to say that the cost of doing so is that at least eight of the ten strong ones cannot afford it. Even if the use of divine crystallization increases the power, the possibility of sudden legend does not increase much. Even if the breakthrough is successful, the range of legendary abilities obtained will be greatly limited and become similar to the attributes of the divine nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, this kind of legend that depends on the breakthrough of external forces, the ultimate in strength is to shrink. Martin doesn't seem to be the kind of mediocre guy. On the contrary, the young cardinal is unfathomable. Richard is very suspicious. Although he did not reach the legendary realm, he has already begun to touch the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
