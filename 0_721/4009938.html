			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s face changed immediately, she flew up from her lion In the air, I cut off an enchantment, but the huge impact of the heavy slap also made her face pale, and she could not fly back a few meters and landed on the ground. The rest of the six enchantments are easy to cross over and intercept, shooting at the horror of the great magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s face was twisted more and more, and she bit her lip, almost bleeding. She slammed her head and stared at the dusk castle with her grief. Everyone on the head of the city touched her eyes and almost trembled involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair jumped on the lion, grabbed its bristles and pulled it, and the lion screamed in pain, jumping ten meters, lightning To the castle at dusk. She no longer looks back because the fate of the great magician is destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six enchantments are almost at the same time, and the Great Magician’s body shines with intense magical light. He has given himself less than three seconds. There are more than 3 protective magics, but these magics are vulnerable to the enchantment that can directly shoot the heroes of the bears of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shining magical light, all the protective magic is broken, and under the ensuing enchantment, the body of the great magician is wildly erupted. The power was completely shattered, leaving only the remaining half of the head to fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other great magician quickly retreated backwards. Just when he judged that the target of the enchantment was not his own, he rushed to his colleagues. Adding a defensive magic is naturally futile. At this time, he has already refused to rush to other people in front of him. He only wants to retreat to a safe distance and get rid of the attack range of the city defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the seven heavy-duty shots he has seen with his own eyes is almost equivalent to the full force of the frontal sanctuary, even if he completely blesses all defensive magic There is no chance that the magic scroll will be superimposed. In a few consecutive battles, he has already had a new understanding of the power of this plane, and no longer does not put the plane indigenous in the eyes when he first came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the back of the city, his eyes staring at the battlefield, countless numbers are beating wildly, the capacity is big, almost let him advance Wisdom talent is also difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the many battles that Richard has experienced, the number of enemies is far greater than this. But the digital impact brought to him is not even one tenth of the moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Sinclair or her Majesty the Knights of the Town, even one-on-one situations are enough to threaten Richard’s life, so Richard’s wisdom talent In the analysis, the operations and calculations in their position have a significantly higher priority, and the amount of data generated is dozens of times larger than that of ordinary cavalry. And Sinclair himself has even reached hundreds of times! Everything about her is reflected in the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Richard felt powerless to control the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Richard is shuddering, suddenly hot and dry like a sea of ​​fire, suddenly cold as if immersed in the ice lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of consciousness, Hinkelel’s face is magnified, and even every subtle expression is clearly displayed. In addition to her, each town bear knight has issued a killing, constantly impacting Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
