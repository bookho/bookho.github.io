			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction conference of Richard once again made the floating island 7-2 The focus of the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference has just ended, and the snow-like invitations and stickers are filled with Richard’s desk. In addition to the arch-rival of the Archimonde family, almost all families are included. The high-ranking giants hope that Richard will be able to attend private dinners within the family and that real-life elders in the family will be present. Those with lower status hope to visit Richard at the right time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected old butlers, regardless of injury, forced to get out of bed, personally accept and organize all the invitations. And led the two literate attendants to record the private demands of the family, and then grouped the invitations into separate categories for the inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that there were even the Wellingborg family in the invitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the family with the highest status of invitations. The giants who rank higher, and even the royal family, do not need to be invited in this way. They are more inclined to send people with sufficient status to personally contact with Richard and make an appointment in person. In the position of the Wellingborough family, this is not necessary, but the action of inviting invitations represents a change in their attitudes. Among the supporters behind Archimonde's enemies, there was a vulgar family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler carefully placed the invitation in the center of the desk of Richard, and it was very strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the conference, Richard was still worried about how he could leave the Great Hall of Fame, so that a group of royal guards would squeeze into the East Temple and solve for him. Wrapped around. The leader of the guards was Prince Morton, who was the representative of the entire royal family on many occasions and the mouthpiece of Philip. Prince Morton announced on the spot that Richard has officially become a royal constructor from today and is directly responsible to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is unexpected and not unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 17-year-old boy became a royal builder. It sounds incredible, but a builder who can make a suit becomes a royal builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the team’s royal guards escorted Richard to leave the temple and took him to a quiet and quiet small building on the hill behind the Fauvist. Although this area is not a floating island area, it is also a royal territory. It is inhabited by some members of the royal family. It is not allowed to enter and exit at will. In the room on the top floor, a fine table of banquets has been prepared. When Richard walked into the room, the two people at the table stood up and greeted Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is a handsome young boy who looks less than twenty years old and his eyes are bright like morning stars. His initial feelings were ordinary, there was no power, but Richard felt a faint pressure from him. In addition, the biggest feature of this boy is that the contour is soft, beautiful and beautiful, and can not see the gender. If you put on the women's dress, it is a top-class beauty, and the appearance is better than the elves, and it is a natural victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to the juvenile, is a tall young man, roughly twenty-four years old. He is strong, but not exaggerated. The proportions of the body are flawless, and the powerful strength of the atmosphere is not disguised. Every muscle in his body can always be thunderous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s gaze fell on him, he only felt a thorn in his eye, as if it were shot by a small electric mans. What makes Richard pay more attention is the light lines of the chest and forearms exposed by young people. Such complicated and complicated magic lines cover the entire upper body. If it is not a fourth-order structure, it should be a certain type of suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, Richard! My name is Nyris, the fourth son of the moody Philip Emperor. You can also call me Neri."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is a gift, according to the strictest aristocratic etiquette, said: "I am honored to meet you, His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyre Si smiled and waved and said, "Don't be so restrained. I hate the cumbersome etiquette between the nobles! Etiquette is a waste of time in many times. Our time is invaluable! Where, you see, I am on the side. This guy often teaches me that it is no different from wasting God. It is a waste of fifteen years, which is equivalent to wasting a life torrent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li In recognition of the words of Nyris, he would like to use every second of Noland. There are countless things waiting for him to deal with, and every time I stay here, Faro will be ten days. The passing of can be full of grace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris pointed out to the tall young man and said, "This guy is called Agamemnon. It is a very bad guy. Most people can't beat him." He is the youngest son of the Duke of Iron and Blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon reached out to Richard and shook hands with Richard, saying: "Agamen Agriculture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"李察."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon's palm is not soft or hard It is very warm, but it feels like power all the time. With Richard's precise talent, he is not sure about his strength level. This is very rare. When Richard's two talents of precision and wisdom are promoted to the second level, there are few of the sacred fields of Noland who can hide power in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, through this handshake, Agamemnon conveyed a lot of information. He is confident and powerful, full of interest in Richard, and reveals appreciation and friendliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard’s heart is slightly stunned. This is not only because of Agamemnon itself, but also because of the name of the Duke of Iron and Blood. The residence of the Duke of Iron and Blood is located on the floating island of 5-5, adjacent to the royal floating island. Matching the position of the floating island is the strength of the Duke of Iron and Blood, not only within the Holy Alliance, but even on the entire continent of Noland, the Duke of Iron and Blood can count as a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon glanced at Richard, then revealed an almost invisible smile and said, "I like you very much, but I don't represent my family." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just met for the first time, and the other party throws out such a direct position, so that Richard, who has begun to become familiar with the aristocratic rule, does not know how to answer it. Finally, I have to say: "This... can be understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris laughed and patted Richard’s shoulder and said, "Okay. I don't care about this guy. He has very few words, and he often can't hear him say a few words all day. He just wants to compress a whole paragraph into one word. Come, eat first, the food should be cold. Wasting time is a waste of grace!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big room, there are only three people, Nyris, Agamemnon and Richard, and the attendants are leaving. The room, and carefully close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there will be no more guests, and Richard sat down and waited for the Prince of Nyres to explain the purpose of the banquet. Intuitively, Richard has a good impression on both young people. They are strong, sunny, and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
