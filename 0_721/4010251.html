This staff headquarters is not established for a long time, but it is to make you laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guests under the leadership of old Joseph , fish into the busy hall. Most of the people in the hall just look at the people who come in, and they are busy with the work at hand, and there is no meaning of salvation or interruption of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guest is standing at a work station and looking at the work of a young man who is in his early twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man’s workbench is the most common one, and he himself seems to have just graduated, because most of his operations must first After a period of thinking, there will be occasional hesitation when you drop the pen. At this moment, a partial topographic map spread out in front of him, which has indicated several possible marching lines, as well as the size of the troops and the corresponding intelligence of the enemy. As can be seen from the contents of the workbench, the young man's task is to calculate the type and quantity of supplies needed for one of the marching routes. Very specific and detailed tasks are the most basic part of the military plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest went to a workbench next to him, where he was sitting on a slightly older soldier with the same topographic map in front of him, but There are three marching routes that need to be calculated. In this way, a combat plan is split into the most subtle parts, and a detailed staff member completes all the details and then re-enters the experienced senior generals. Summarized into a complete operational plan that can be executed immediately for the commander. And when a genius commander has a whimsical plan, its feasibility will be the most rigorous deduction and test here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival guests are thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a system can't replace a genius general, but it can minimize the chances of ordinary generals making mistakes and maximize the efficiency of resource utilization. And the key to this system is actually the internal mechanism process, and enough talents to reach the qualified line. Genius may be rare, and qualified personnel need only effective training and enough experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now, the staff headquarters of the Joseph family has been running well, which will make any general of the Joseph family very difficult, at least you don’t want Count on what stupid low-level mistakes he will make. With this plane warfare staff headquarters as a guarantee, it is not a problem for the Joseph family to continue to stand at least in FS. And as the generals of the upper and lower generals gradually adapt to the staff system, the overall quality of the Joseph family army will leap to a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who conceived and created this staff headquarters is undoubtedly a true genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guests suddenly sighed and revealed the old voice, slowly said: "I heard that this staff headquarters is Raymond’s vision and established. It’s a pity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph’s face was dim, but he sighed heavily and said: “Since Raymond knows that his life may be very After a short period of time, he has been working to establish and improve this staff headquarters. His ideal is to leave the family with a foundation for continued prosperity after leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another guest asked: "Is there any other way? With our current solid relationship, if it is necessary to sacrifice, I can be a temporary sacrifice to the Joseph family's two intermediate sacrifices." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph shook his head and his face was more sullen, saying: "Raymond needs a very special kind of grace, and the probability of occurrence is extremely low. We I have calculated from the past history that the probability of this kind of grace is no more than 1%. I don't want to save Raymond, but the cost is too great, so big that we can't afford it, and hope for realization. Moreover, in the early stage, we had a lot of battles with Gordon, and the losses were heavy. It has seriously damaged the roots of the family. So many battles in the core plane have been affected. So even if I am willing to borrow sacrifices, I will gamble a little. Hope, but in terms of the reputation of the nobility, I was unable to repay it in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guests sighed. However, a middle-aged woman asked: "So what is the fruit of the tree of life, will it be effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should... there will be." Old Joseph answered very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why..." The middle-aged woman just said halfway, and someone next to me cautioned: "Nefarian..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman immediately realized that she had apologized again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph has recovered at this time, smiled and said: "Nothing, it is normal to fight for Nefarian. I did not expect to be in the Royal There will be a tree of life tree at the auction, and I don’t think that Nefarian will suddenly appear and grab it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefarian is from the Ossa family of the sacred dynasty. This family with the black dragon as a clan belongs to one of the seven giants in the sacred dynasty. No matter the foundation, strength and wealth, it is more than the Joseph family. Nefarian is the first strongman of the younger generation of the Ossa family. His strength is close to the legend. He personally came to Faust, and naturally he is determined to be the fruit of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another guest said: "I heard that the fruit of this tree of life comes from the green forest of the Schumpeter family. One, there must be a second one. If you can't buy it, then you can use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph looked very hearty and hesitated. I said, "I agree, but let's first look at what Raymond thinks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph left with those obviously distinguished guests The staff headquarters came to the war room at the end of the corridor, where Raymond had just laid down the thick file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several sets of comfortable sofas in the combat room. The guests each found a seat, and then the beautiful girl in military uniform sent red wine fruit, then Quietly retired from the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond saw that everyone had arrived, so he stood on the podium of the war room and magnified a map with magical images, pointing at the top of it. However, the very neat symbol of the army said: "You, all the adaptations of the troops have been completed, and the officers are already familiar with the new order system. Now this unit is ready to fight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following VIPs are immediately amazed. They are very clear about how incredible it is to revive and reorganize tens of thousands of troops in a matter of more than a week. However, after visiting the staff headquarters of the Joseph family, it seems that miracles are not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
