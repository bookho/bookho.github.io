			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a light and cold voice coming from outside the door: "Is it slippery?" I can kill no less than you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde changed his face and snorted, indicating that he was not afraid of water, but wisely did not say anything again. After the splash, the twilight came in, and then Oral, Sandro, and the Ogre gathered in the small hotel. There is a sense of soul between the followers and Richard. The place where Richard stays is their gathering place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural entered the hotel and asked: "Master, already in the battlefield, our casualties have not been fully counted, but should be in two thousand people. Above. The Sands adults are working hard to treat the wounded, and there is no way to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Good! Now go to the goddess of the hunting goddess Hi, please come over, and the Viscount of Heim, also come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde hesitated for a moment and finally asked: "Hey, today we are all desperate to fight back to them. It is not good tomorrow." Fight! There are 30,000 troops outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, they have a maximum of 25,000. And if they can enter the city tomorrow, they may even There are no one thousand five." Richard faintly replied. There are elite bats in the air. Richard has a very good grasp of the casualties of both sides, and the error is no more than 100 people. It is also impossible for Salenville to send cavalry into the city to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is more worried: "Our disadvantage is not bigger tomorrow?" The original strength of one to three is opposite in today's World War I. enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyebrows are wrinkled, and it seems that something is difficult to decide. After thinking for a moment, he said, “This is not a solution... but, first Let me think about it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the goddess of the goddess of hunting, Xiyou, was brought into the hotel by a humanoid warrior. As soon as she saw Richard, she blinked and smiled and said, "What is your business with Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the priest’s eyes, But on the body of Richard, especially the striking wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the goddess of the hunting goddess allows the hunters to hide their tracks in complex terrain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Xiyou eyes brightened, proudly replied: "This is the field where the goddess is good at!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Very good! After a while, I am going to go out to attack the enemy. Is the Xiyou priest willing to go with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sneak attack?" Xiyou was surprised. "You don't have to hurt." And we... our mana..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and took a magic box from the side of an elite humanoid warrior and opened it. Exposed in a row of neatly arranged pharmacy bottles, said: "Magic is not a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiyou took a sigh of relief and shouted: "Strong Magical Recovery Agent! So much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Faro, everything related to magic is worth a lot. Even if Xiyou was the priest who presided over the temple, he had never seen so many magical healing agents put together, let alone all powerful potions. With this batch of drugs, she will be able to return to full prosperity within half an hour. The only drawback of this medicine is that it can only be taken once a day. If there are any shortcomings, it is the price of a bottle of thousands of gold coins, which will make people feel that it is not a potion, but gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Xiyou to recover from the shock, and the exclaimed excitement of the Viscount of Hem: "Richard, you are a legendary general." It’s so easy to kill a sanctuary! How do you know that General Barry of the Iron Triangle Empire will appear in that street?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him’s eyes are hot I had to feel a little helpless, and I had to say, "Good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Heim shook his head firmly, then to the water, the twilight and Gangde and so on, said: "I have seen it, he, her, and her, as well as the two sacred fields, have ambushed in front of the street! Then, solve the battle in one minute! This is the famous ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but looked cold and said: "I am not letting you hide yourself?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill the enemy!" Heim waved his hand, the white face was full of flushing, insisted: "I am a nobleman, but also a warrior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided not to hear Him's nonsense. He threw a bottle of magic recovery medicine to the person who needed it, then unscrewed a bottle and poured it up into his throat. He tossed the empty bottle, put on the blood-stained top, and put the extinction behind him. He also mentioned the fate of his hands and ordered all the followers. He said, "Let me go with me! Let's go to Saran Wilhelm." The boy came to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A follower was silently preparing for the battle, and Gangde stood up and mentioned the scarlet axe. Feel free to move a few muscles. The wound on his body was thus opened a few times, but Gangde did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was neglected, but looking at this group of people who are full of iron and blood, the Viscounts of Hem also rushed, and he took a big step forward. Loudly ask: "What about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Richard took a serious look at Him, thought about it, patted him on the shoulder and said: "You bring a few people, and immediately return to your old man, telling him that several legions of the Iron Triangle Empire are now in the blood-stained land, and let him find ways to persuade the Duke of Glasgow to send troops and cut off the road that Allenwell will return home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, isn't this a runaway?" This is obviously not the answer Heim wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said solemnly: "No! This is very important. If you can safely persuade the Duke to send troops, then Salenwell will dare to stay here. Three days, otherwise he would have to consider the huge risk of the retreat being completely cut off. I think, if possible, the Duke will not let such a good chance. So, you are very important, if not you go, I am afraid the Duke It is not going to send troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very important?" Viscount Heim is somewhat doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a heavy shot on his shoulder and said: "Very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, Richard went out of the hotel, and a group of followers with bloody tastes also walked past the Viscount. Hem is a little embarrassed, he vaguely feels, it seems that Richard's very dangerous followers look at his eyes less contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, only the Him and his several soldiers were left in the hotel. A moment later, Shim suddenly turned to a soldier behind him and asked, "I am really important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-inspector has been tested and answered without thinking : "Adults are always important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red tide on the face of Him’s face faded, looking at the place where Richard left, suddenly said: "I am now I know, how important it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-brother was shocked and felt that he seemed to be abnormal tonight: "The Viscount? You ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him interrupted his words and said, "You, immediately return to your father, let him immediately send troops, bring all the people Rescue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The pro-brother looked confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Hem took a heavy shot on his shoulder and said, "Go! You are important!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heim went with the remaining pro-military. Only the remaining soldier was in a daze in the hotel. The pro-Binger wanted to remind the Viscount that he had sent several people to rush back to report for help. And not only that, but also spent a lot of money to remotely send the magic message back. Perhaps now, the first reinforcements from the Earl of Cang are already on the road. At the latest tomorrow morning, the army of the Duke of Glasgow will set off. The third road reinforcements came from the Countess Ekaterina. This woman is not only politically very creative, but also military power is directly chasing the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, five hundred cavalry sneak out of the city. These knights are actually the combat units of the hen's nest, including three hundred and fifty humanoid warriors and one hundred and fifty throwing soldiers. The horses are moving at an average speed, but the hooves are completely silent. This is the field of the hunter of the goddess of hunting, and it is also the place where Richard uses Xiyou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five hundred cavalry did not attack the squad of Salenwell, but ran to a small forest in the opposite direction. Five hundred empire cavalry camped here and prevented Richard's remnants from escaping from this direction. These cavalrymen have experienced a lot of battles and are well-hidden, but they cannot escape the eyes and ears of elite bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately a kilometer from the grove, Richard did not seem to have any orders, and the entire team stopped on its own. Sandru began to recite the curse, and in the increasingly strong sense of death, the black warriors silently walked out of the summoning array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiyou stared blankly at the black warriors who appeared one after another, and the body was shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly approached her and said softly: "Be careful, don't throw your treatment on these black warriors."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiyou nodded reluctantly, and suddenly covered his mouth and shouted: "God, what is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The death scent under the night sky was suddenly full and full. First, a humming horse head was swept out of the call, and then the knight's huge body barely squeezed out of the summoning magical array. This is an incomparably tall knight with a huge sword in his hands. Although the sword is covered with rust, only the size and weight of the giant sword can be seen as unimaginable lethality. The rich undead atmosphere emitted by the death knight is even more exciting. Xiyou subconsciously wants to escape. Although the gods of the true gods naturally restrain the undead creatures, they are also ineffective against undead creatures with excessive levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
