The Duke of the Wolf is about to go to war, apparently not going to deal with the issue of the Baron in the near future, not to mention the special character of the Viscount Him. But the Duke can not care about it for a while, but Richard can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the key position of the Baron’s territory, a baron of the small square, standing on the side of the Glasgow, is a great threat to Richard. When he got the ransom, he released the viscount of Heim. In addition to the force, there was nothing in the hands of Richard that the baron of the small Fang Dan could be put on the table. The court of the viscount of Hem may also be peaceful for a while because of the defeated armistice agreement. The weak state of the baron is expected to end soon, because the Duke of Glasgow will soon send reinforcements. Richard did not express anything on the spot, and immediately left the residence of Sir Shandon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his place of residence, Richard headed into the rudimentary magic lab, trying to complete the last small part of the spell penetration. However, he tried to unite his spirit several times, but he always failed. After almost a reimbursement of the entire structure, Richard simply stood up, stood in front of the window, looked at the lush forest outside the window, and every detail of the baroness of Fang Dan, who fought side by side, flowed through his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk castle is elegant and refined, and it shines in the hands of the former Baron Fontaine. Every detail in the castle is impeccable, showing the baron's taste and subtle care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that comes from the wind is fresh and the grass is fresh. It was the smell of the workers when they burned the shrubs, and it also gave the original scenery a feeling of war and smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fang Dan, your son really gave me a problem!" Richard smiled. "You handed Sisuo to my hand. Have you foreseen the situation today? But I would rather believe that you are an intuitive person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;If it was a cranky thought, after a long time, Richard only packed up his mood and thought quietly in his heart: "Well, Fang Dan, you guy won. I will protect the dusk castle you left behind. Will help your son to eradicate the cancer in the family. Just decide, who let me owe you a guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Li Cha Zhen did not feel that his true age was actually only two years older than Baron Xiaofang Dan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making up his mind, Richard’s mood was settled a lot, and he returned to the lab to complete the second-order spell penetration in one go and put it Loaded on the position of your chest. In the focused work, Richard quietly completed the transformation from the quasi-constructor to the builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what Richard needs to do is wait, waiting for the family of Him to redeem the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time is longer than what Richard expected, but when Count Earl, the uncle of the Viscount of Heim, took a full twenty When the fleet of trucks appeared in front of Richard, he knew why the count would be three days late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Viscounts of Him knows his own people. When he knows that the family messenger has lost his time, he has no fear of performance, proudly and arrogantly There will surely be a ransom in line with his noble unicorn Viscount status, which will open the eyes of the country knights. This time, the Viscount finally remembered the title of the nobility of the Cavaliers in the adjective suffix. Richard is a little bit sorrowful, can't help but swear, is the Viscount family very used to pay ransom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
