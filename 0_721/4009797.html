He sneered a few times and said: "Li Cha has left Faust in a week ago. It is definitely unknown. It is definitely to open up the plane. As for the coordinates of the plane, we should not imagine it for the time being. The Vatican’s great priest sent the broken sand to the side of Richard and followed him to develop the plane. Do you think it is possible to get the coordinates from the Eternal Dragon Hall?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha and Liusha... Everyone, don't you think of anything?" Raymond smiled and asked, he was not depressed, even confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Deshang’s face sank and seemed to dislike Raymond’s way of speaking. Although on the sixth floor, the Wellingberg family is undoubtedly much stronger than Joseph, and the strength of the Joseph family has been severely weakened by years of entanglement with Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Raymond did not really intend to let everyone guess, so he said it directly: "Lee adds sandpaper to explain their destination. It should be a low-level plane. The composition of the pioneering team will be around ten. In fact, we don’t have to go to the seat surface coordinates in the hands of Gordon or the Eternal Dragon Temple. We don’t even need to know that the original coordinates are What, just change their coordinates a little, you can achieve all the purposes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Deschamps eyes bright, It seems that Raymond doesn't seem so annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond immediately gave the answer: "It's very simple, we also go to the Eternal Dragon Temple to sacrifice! The proceeds of God are all used to change Richard's plane. The pioneering coordinates replace the original low-level plane with the secondary plane with the upper limit of strength above 18! This way we can not only get the coordinates of the new plane, but also send a special pioneering team to the plane. Competing for the territory, while finding and killing Richard. The rule allows the upper limit of the rank of the sub-level team to be at the fifteenth level. This is not too much for the consumption of our human resources, so as not to cause Archimonde Be alert, and the strength is enough to absolutely suppress the original team of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa thought calmly and said: "This This is a good idea, but it has been a week..." The sacrifice has always changed the future and cannot erase the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond quickly said: "He should be preparing for somewhere. We have been observing the activities of several important branches of the Archimonde family. Before the sacrifice, Richard certainly did not have the resources to prepare for the plane. However, our actions were faster and time was running out.” His answer was so confident that several other family representatives could not exchange their eyes. Joseph and Archimonde are enemies, and it is not surprising that they intervene and monitor each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa continued to indulge, "but the grace that Richard bears is not low. In this case, the sacrifices required may be about three times normal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we share a few, we can still get it together." The Count of Deshang interjected, then he turned to look at the representative of the Bear Peter family. Frowning said: "As for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bear Peter family had just sacrificed a few months ago, and the family strength was seriously affected by the turmoil in recent years. Loss, it is estimated that there is no decent sacrifice at all. But if you want to stay in this small circle that is similar to the secret alliance, if you don't contribute to such an important thing, you will definitely be kicked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when Deshang’s gaze swept over, the representative of the Xiong Peter’s family gritted his teeth and said, “People who want to kill Richard will be out of us! The benefits of the new plane will be equalized. We are divided equally.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Licha and quicksand are not so easy to deal with. Who are you going to lead?" Deschamps did not relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the Bear Peter family once again bite his teeth: "Sinclair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good That's it!" Deshang said with satisfaction. Then he discussed with the Duke of Mensa and Raymond the details of the three offerings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, the Duke of Mensa led a group of knights into the Eternal Dragon Hall, began a sacrifice ceremony, and prayed for grace. This time it was only a minimum-special sacrifice and a temporary appointment, so it is not necessary for the Vatican to appear. It is enough to be hosted by only one official priest. However, when the ritual ceremony began, the light in the Eternal Dragon Hall became more and more prosperous, and the divine power surged from the void. The power of the eternal and timeless dragon alone was close to the highest level of sacrifice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely rare accident, so that the priest who presided over the sacrifice was almost faint. The sacrifice of this scale was not hosted by her, but now the unexpected increase in the gods fell on her. Therefore, after the ceremony, she was extraordinarily diligent and personally sent the Duke of Mensa out of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This late-night sacrifice was a small talk, and it was also spread in the circle of nobility for a week or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, close friends congratulate the Duke of Mensa, thinking that the Mensa family is so much more divine, the position must be very solid, maybe not used for more than ten years Then consider the threat of Archimonde. At this time, the Duke of Mensa thanked him with dedication. As for the specific content of the sacrifice, he did not reveal it. Those who do not know the ins and outs of this ceremony, in fact, the so-called closeness with the Mensa family is also very limited, floating on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on the island of Samuel, Richard was ignorant of everything that happened in FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night is his last preparation time, so the inventory of personnel, inventory equipment, ready to deal with various accidents, all sorts of trivial things, almost no end. Waiting for a little clue, I found that the sky is already bright. When he was busy, Richard felt that it was not easy to be a lord, even if he was leading a team of twenty people, it was not as simple as controlling a complicated magic experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master Lina has already arranged the transmission array and can only run when it is started. With her constant care, the coordinates of the plane have been checked and confirmed, and everything is accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the transmission of the squad, Richard began the last confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a sacred sander who follows him on the road to the development of the plane, the soul guards the water, the earth warrior Gangde, two ogre thirami Su and three-pointed, the elf bard Oral. The wind is the wind, and finally the ten-level step knight of the squad provided by the Archimonde family. Except for Richard, quicksand and water, others did not carry any advanced enchanting equipment to save the mana of the transmission. The most important thing in terms of materials is the two large boxes filled with various basic magic materials. This is the essential material for Richard to make the magic pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything was confirmed, Lina activated the transmission array, and the turbulent magic emerged from the spar embedded in the circle and merged in the air. The violent power torn the space, and stabilized the cracks of time by ancient rules, a space door that was enough to accommodate a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
