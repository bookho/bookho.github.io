			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina picked up the magical stationery of the communication and carefully read it again, suddenly Showing a charming smile, said to himself: "The little guy wants us to loyal to him! Well, at such a young age, I dare to take over the mess left by the Gotton adults. The courage is big enough, I don't know how to do it. Ah, ah! Well, just if everything goes wrong here, go back once, anyway, ask for help, hey, hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is full of brains What I thought was that Richard discovered that it was not the reinforcements, but the help, what kind of expression would be at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at sunset, in the Archimonde family castle, Richard saw Achilles, Semma and Lina. The meeting place was Gordon's war room. When the three knights entered the war room, Richard was standing in front of the huge magic sand table, staring at the topographic map of Noland's mainland, thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three knights discovered in the first place that Richard’s station was the place where Gotton was used to it, and he did not know whether it was intentional or unintentional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a few minutes, Richard lifted his meditation and looked at the three knights one by one, saying: "Dark Pastor Asiri Sri Lanka, the blood of the Holy Knight, the horse, the dragon Master, Lina..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time Richard reads a name, the corresponding knight will be slightly covered. This is an attitude and a ritual, meaning that at least on the surface, the three knights accept the position of Richard on the station, even if it is temporary. However, as with the scale of their salute, no one knows how long the three knights will obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled and said, "I was already prepared, and maybe a knight could not see it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look so handsome, I have to come back." Senma replied lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The air of the floating world is helpful to the skin." This is Lina's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Achilles, who seems to never smile, said: "We have enough respect for Gordon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the truth!" Richard laughed. He took three sheets of paper and handed them to the three knights. Asiris swept over and saw a dense list of all the sacrifices that could be used for sacrifice. When they are put together, they are about to catch up with the specifications of a high-level sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the sacrifices originally placed in the castle warehouse. It was sent by my teacher, Su Hailun, but not long ago, on the floating island. The Akmons of those branch families rushed into the castle, wounded the housekeeper and the sorrow, and ransacked these sacrifices." Richard said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma put down the list and still said lazily: "Many people who participated in the day seem to be on the floating island..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master interjected: "They are running outside the floating island! Is it scared by us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the war room, you can see that the transmission array leading to the floating island has become a mess. Many members of the branch family are rushing into the transmission array and want to leave the floating island. Most of them carry their luggage, but there is definitely no sacrifice in it. The robbed sacrifices were taken away in the first place, and then through some channels, voluntarily or involuntarily, most of the final destinations were gathered in the hands of the real big men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after some time, many people will understand that sacrifices are resources for the giants and disasters for the weak families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma yawned and said, "Is it right for me to kill them now? I will run out later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris faintly said: "It doesn't matter if you run some people. Anyway, you have to kill a family in the future, just a little trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma asked: "So now, the three of us have arrived, can we start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows Richard said faintly: "No, let them run! This is my business, I will handle it myself. As for the lost sacrifices, they will naturally let them all spit out, plus interest! Now is not yet When fighting, the real enemy of Archimonde is not on this floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three knights look at each other, there are some surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha hands clasped in front of the magic sand table, leaning forward, staring at the three unruly knights, slowly said: "I know In the eyes of most people, including you, I think that I am very weak, not enough to sit in the original position of the Marquis of Gordon. The throne of Archimonde is built on the crater, if not absolutely powerful The force suppresses the magma in the ground, and it will be turned into a ash by the gushing flame! I admit that I am still far from being able to sit in this seat, but there must be someone in this seat, it can't be empty. It happens on the floating island. Things have proved that the empty throne is a disaster for all people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, in the future, I will have this position The power of rivalry may not last long! And, one day, I will return this position to Gordon first, and then rely on my own strength to kick him down!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon is a rough, wild volcano. And Richard has inherited the characteristics of many elves, which are more handsome, refined, and reserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are exactly two extremes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, in the eyes of the three knights, Richard seems to be coincident with Gordon. Gordon once said many words that are no different from Hu Bing, but in the end, the miracle will always be born in his hands. At this moment, Richard claimed that in the future, their incomparable Lord will be kicked from the throne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculous, but the three knights can’t smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard said: "Since you are back, stay for two more days! Two days later, I will hold my own assembly conference. I I don't expect your allegiance. I just hope that after this conference, you can have more confidence in me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regression of Richard is a fall of Gordon After another heavy news, although not as shocking as the Gotton, the entire Holy Alliance, but at least it was a small half of the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The No. 7-2 floating island is the center of the vibration, naturally stunned countless cockroaches, and then spread out in a circle. Those who try to leave the floating island are one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not everyone can leave the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission array is constantly flashing, and the light curtains are flashing, and the magic crystals are consumed. These magic crystals are naturally from the warehouse of Archimonde, which is exactly the storage of Gordon. This is also the ultimate benefit that the children of this branch family naturally acquired. They came from the transmission array and from the transmission array. No one thought that this transmission array was also consumed and cost money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
