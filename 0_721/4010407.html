			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness of Richard, seven links disappeared in a flash, Before and after, a total of eleven elite knights died in her hands. Most of them were the result of her last suicide attack. With eleven knights changing opponents' sanctuary strong, Richard felt very cost-effective. According to this ratio exchange, perhaps the elite knight in the hands of Richard has not finished, Shulan will be dead, but even in Noland, a sanctuary is also on the upper level of the pyramid, then in the rest This is especially true of Lan. The experience of every sanctuary is a legend. However, the elite knight is only the creation of the mother's nest. In this proportion, the mother's nest is equivalent to four or five days. Destroy a sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extremely fierce battlefield, Richard actually had a lingering feeling in his heart, but then a sanctuary appeared, attracting Richard’s Attention, the luck of this strong man is not very good, he met Tiramisu, blessed the war 傀儡 and the magic of the armed double-headed ogres, especially on this battlefield, and this The Hughland strongman is obviously also known for his strength. He actually blocked the ogre from all his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not have the time of pride and happiness, and immediately gave a very painful roar. At the moment he hardly blocked the ogre hammer, there were at least three The knife was cut into his lower back at the same time. It was the splash, the twilight and the Zonghu. The apparent cooperation between them was not enough, because anyone could afford the life of this sanctuary. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of Richard, the knights were built with a team of ten riders, and one ** alternately moved forward, and the offensive continued, at both ends of the wall The knights on the battle also gathered back and protected the back. Hundreds of knights were like a rushing battle. There was nothing to stop. Richard just continued to march forward, and the enemies in front must be eliminated. As long as the rear is forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of Richard is the wall of the fortress of the mainland, which is the highest point of the entire fortress, and is also the strongest of the Shulans to block the Noland The barrier, as long as Richard occupied the wall, it is equivalent to splitting the Shulan defender into two. At that time, the Shulan warrior in the foreground will face a double-sided attack, and the number of the wall is still on the wall. Among the numerous city defenses and fortresses, nine of the fifteen giants were placed on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, I don’t know who made a scream: "They are going to the Yonghui barrier and stop them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yonghui barrier is the high wall that blocks the Nolans. Under this high wall, there are numerous bones of the Shulan and Noland warriors. Even if it is Gotton, it stops at the Yonghui barrier. When Gotton retreated to the southern end of the bridge of the mainland, this high wall was named the Yonghui barrier by the Shulan people to commemorate the brilliant and cruel war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard has mobilized an unprecedented elite force, and has broken into the fortress from the weak rear. The goal is this high wall. This is another of the Shulan people. The spiritual pillar is also the place where Richard is in urgent need of conquest, because Gordon has never conquered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is moving silently, he doesn’t shout, but hundreds of orders will reach a single elite knight in every minute. There, all the knights, all followers have become a whole, their goal is no longer concealed, is the Yonghui barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard’s wisdom talent has been transferred to the limit, even the second consciousness is used to analyze the battlefield, and the instructions are given to every ten knights. They are all a small team. Each team has a special elite knight. All the knights in the team will follow the knight's knight movement. Splash, twilight and Zonghu have a clearer connection with Richard. Once Richard discovers the sanctuary, he will breathe the three killing stars in consciousness. Any one of the Sanctuary of Shulan will be surrounded by these three people, and there will be no way to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the sky from a height, you will find that the formation of the knights is undergoing the most subtle and complex changes with the topography. A team of knights is like a blade. The sawtooth is extremely sharp and efficient. It cuts the enemy pieces from the whole and then destroys them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of Richard is getting faster and faster, and the entire knight’s group is gradually increasing, and the frequency of attacks and killings is gradually getting faster. The way for the subordinates and followers to understand their determination, and he himself, followed the brigade on the move, continue to cut down one person who is close to himself with an unpretentious knife, there is no match under the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked unobtrusive, but he killed a lot of people, so it still caught the attention of the Shulan people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Shulan warrior rushed to Richard, wearing the costumes of ordinary warriors, but caused a little attention from Richard, so Richard was a little serious Some more, turned to look at the soldier, a knife like an electric stab, in Richard's anticipation, this knife will pick up the opponent's chest, cut his heart, although not immediately die, but enough to disintegrate him Fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when it was heard, Richard’s thought that he would kill was actually blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard was really surprised. He turned to look at this seemingly ordinary Shulan warrior, with a faint glow in his eyes. Where is the ordinary warrior? It is clearly a strong sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror on the face of this sacred domain is far more than that of Richard, who holds a standard sword of the Shulan warrior. At this moment, she was retracted to the chest. The sword was almost attached to her breastplate. This was able to block Richard's knife. Richard's movements were soothing and clear, but the knife was so incredible that he could do his best. When I got down, I was already scared of a cold sweat. Only when I really stood in front of Richard, did he know the horror of this knife, and he realized why so many good men in the army rushed to Richard, but they were cut across the same way as ordinary soldiers. inverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each movement of Richard has a strong deceptive effect, he is constantly changing the rhythm irregularly, suddenly and slowly, when the strong fight Instinct has long been formed, but if you stand in front of Richard and fight with instinct, it is almost equal to sending his neck to Richard's blade. Richard snorted and finally stopped and stood in front of the sanctuary. Good, if it is in the field of extinction, such a knife can kill a mouse, the sanctuary of Shulan is of course stronger than the mouse, but it is also limited, and certainly cannot be compared with the sanctuary of the main plane, Nolan The sanctuary of Germany has a magical structure, the sanctuary of Daxedas has a strong natural ability, and the sanctuary of Shulan has almost nothing. The totem pattern is only used by a small number of people, and its power is not very high. Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under the rush, this Shulan sanctuary can block Richard’s surprise, which can be said to be quite good, but Richard intends to He wasted time on his body, and his faint light was shining in his eyes. His body was flashing, his hands seemed to have blood and blood, and the brutal slaughter was slowly mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the barbaric slaughter looks very slow, even a bit of lazy taste, but with a long knife, there is a residual image, it looks There is a strong sense of unreality. The Shulan Sanctuary is almost silent. He certainly knows that this kind of scene can only explain one thing. That is, Richard’s knife is actually too fast to be able to fight. He can’t even think of it. Any way of blocking, can only scream in despair, put the sword on the chest, and hope that it can block Richard's blade just by chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how could his luck be so good, the barbaric slaughter gently bends, draws a beautiful arc, and gently slams the sword on his sword, and cuts the standard long sword of ordinary material into two. Paragraph, then the sword pierced his breastplate, did not enter the chest, the tip of the knife came out from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled sound, the sacred field of the powerful suddenly burst out of a bloody fog, minced meat and internal organs are sprayed out, in his A terrible big hole has appeared on the back, and even the spine has been shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp knife pierced his chest, but the entrance was only a small small wound, but on his back there was a horror of about half a meter. Empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha slowly closed his knife, his face passed a pale, the power of this knife is so horrible, in fact, Richard has spurred four lives, and The result of a dozen dozen hits in a single knife, and the superb effects of many lives are superimposed, resulting in this almost unbelievable killing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard sighed in his heart, knowing that his realm of skill is actually too far, if the knife is stabbed by the night, then the blade It will only stay in the opponent's body, and finally let him have only a thin knife in his body, but the internal organs will all be smashed by the horror effects of life. In the end, Richard can't control to the point of fineness like the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife, Richard himself may still be dissatisfied, but it is enough to shock most people present, the tragic end of the Sanctuary strong, not only The Shulans were deeply fearful, and even the followers of Richard also looked stunned and chilled. Many people asked themselves such a question in their hearts. If they stood on the opposite side of Richard, is it possible? Can hold such a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the strongest blow of Richard. After a knives, he also took a few breaths to lead the Cavaliers to move forward, Richard’s goal. There is only one, Yonghui barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard never hides his strength, the momentum rises and rises, and he continues to move forward with a crisp and sharp knife. The incoming enemy has turned over and overturned, and sometimes simply rushed into the Shulan Army. So he is centered, and a storm of blood and flesh will be blown up in an instant. Richard has a humanoid metal storm. Countless broken limbs flew into the night sky, then flew around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
