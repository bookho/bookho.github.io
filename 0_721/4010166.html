			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, the Duke of the Wolf sent to Richard through the magic transfer array A letter came. The letter mentions the Earl of Burr and tells the Richards Association to prepare to share the interests of Richard in the blood-stained land with the royal family. In addition, the Masters Association is still investigating the background of Richard’s origins and seems to have begun to The suspicion is just that no hard evidence has been found. They are prepared to force the 'teacher' behind Richard to confirm the true strength and background of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this letter, Richard sneered and said to the sand: "Without my 'teacher' or 'half god', it’s just us. It’s enough for them to try it out!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But according to the letter, there is also a positive side, the royal family is not ready to go to the bright face yet, but only Be prepared to intervene in the dark. That is to say, like the Count of Burr, the royal family and the three Dukes will remain silent. The war belongs only to the Association of Richards and Masters. Of course, the alliance is another matter, but at least Richard will not be with the entire Sequoia Kingdom. For the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, the atmosphere of Lanshui Oasis City suddenly became very tense. The army affiliated with Richard was mobilized and a batch of people left the city. The nobility speculated on the whereabouts of Richard, and finally came to a conclusion that was disturbing. The direction of the assembly of the Richards turned out to be the Sequoia Kingdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, Richard’s army has been training and phasing out. The troops who were born into slaves were reorganized from the original nearly 10,000 people into 5,000 people today, but the overall combat strength did not fall. The six hundred barbarian warriors inside are even more daunting. Within a few days now, Richard left only 1,500 people in Oasis City, and he took all the rest of the army and followers, left Oasis City, and marched toward the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Richard has always had an embarrassing group of gods, and this time is no exception. He transferred dozens of pastors from the three goddesses to the army, leaving only three goddesses to stay in the temple in Oasis. The incompetent aristocrats reconfirmed the movement of Richard from the left-behind pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is assembling his army to his territory, the border of the Sequoia Kingdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with a series of recent events in the kingdom, the nobility immediately linked Richard’s actions to the Masters Association! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small conference room at the headquarters of the Lausanne Lake Masters Association, three mages are sitting around an old round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is made of mahogany as the main decoration material. Because it is too old, the surface of the wood has a bright purple and purple luster. The conference room was small and the ceiling was very low. It didn't seem to be well maintained. The oil paintings on the paintings were somewhat mottled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the three mages sitting around the table are all dark gold robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, old demon instructor opposite Ryan, the president of the Masters Association, Theodore. Another dry and thin old man is the Hoover Master with the highest magic level at the Master Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president looked solemn at this time and said slowly: "We are a fairly big move this time, and the risk of taking it seems to be too big." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan sneered and said: "If we succeed, we can shock the nobility of the entire kingdom. The status of the Masters Association in the kingdom will be unprecedentedly strong. How can such a huge gain have no risk at all? And so far, everything is In our grasp, the old guy in Burr can give him some poison at any time and send him to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president frowned and said: No, it’s not appropriate. It’s better to let him accept the public trial in the secret court and plead guilty. This is better. Master Mone is very good at the magic of the soul class, and then let Monet manipulate him.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s sardonic smile said: “Don’t anyone in the court see that Burr is arrogant? What does it mean for us to do this? No one can lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president said quietly: "Even if a person can't lie, do it. This is between us and the kingdom." The last piece of fig leaf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent description!" Well drum a few palm, he praised the. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the president has no change at all, just as Ryan is really complimenting him. He flipped through the information in front of him and said, "Is there any problem with Richard? Has his origin been detected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Lean’s frown. "The trace of the initial appearance of Richard, which seems to be traced, seems to be related to an original ectopic invasion of the Baiyan Principality. So I found the great priest of the god of courage, Nei An in the kingdom temple, and asked him to ask for the gods. The gods judged the origin of Richard. He had already promised, but somehow, the connection between Nei and the priests suddenly became very weak. The great priest has not been the god of courage for more than a year. This time, although he launched the highest level of ritual, he still could not communicate the will of the god of courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodore the president nodded, Says: "It is said that similar things have happened in the church of the god of time and the god of stability. The great priest of Sinai also cannot get the god from him. The situation of Xerxes is better. The church in the last half year is big. The priest has also received a god, but the content of the god I don’t see any anomalies, I just ask them to find ways to increase the number of believers as soon as possible, and then there is no sound.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyan frowned and said, “This is a bit of a hassle. The investigation of Richard’s affairs can only be put aside first. However, although the guys in the blood-stained land have rumors, I still think that the power behind Richard is estimated to be at most a big magician, not a legendary mage. There are a few strong people in total. How could it be that a new legendary mage suddenly emerged without knowing it? This time, if Richard is smart enough to let the enchantment equipment and the interests of the cross-line business road come out, if he Don't let go... Hey! Young people who don't know how to advance and retreat will die a lot every year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Theodore tapped the table and said: My suggestion is to immediately put the association into a state of emergency, and all the troops and combat mage will enter the state of readiness. We need to beware of the Duke of the Wolf, although Richard is not his core vassal, the title given is only a jazz, relationship It doesn't look too close, but Richard is in name after all It is his vassal. Of course, the other two dukes must also guard against, and the king, he is the real old fox. This is the mobilization order, you see, if there is no problem, then it is decided. Of course, I still keep My opinion on this war is that we must control the scale. And you should not forget that I am firmly opposed to this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President put a page The document was pushed to Ryan and Hoover. Ryan’s heart was a glimpse, and the document was already ready. It seems that the president’s content and final conclusions of today’s meeting have long been known. This old fox is not simple. Although the personal level is one level lower than that of Ryan, but the mind is unfathomable, it is not so easy for Ryan to control the power of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
