The most powerful intruders have tried to enter the area of ​​the will of the forest, but they have left uncomfortably under the blow and oppression of the forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident has greatly increased the confidence of the tribe's elves. However, what worried the elders was the leader of the invaders. This is a very scary, very calm and patient guy. He is not in a hurry to move, but just keeps on speeding down the forest. This is a means of fundamentally weakening the will of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the intruders have made so little progress so far, the trees they cut off are compared to the trees in the tens of millions of square kilometers. Can be completely ignored. However, if the elves attack, they will inevitably suffer fiasco, which is completely different from the situation in which the invaders have attacked and defended each other in the past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party seems to have lost patience, arrogant and tough, and seems to be planning to flatten the entire forest, this red/naked/naked brutality It is even more frightening to let the ancient trees of the war completely wither than the invaders of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Zhu Bu is too young to run to participate in the battle, his loss is more deadly than the huge damage of the tribal power in a short time. Fortunately, he captured an important man of the terrible opponent. This was the result of the war ancient tree Urano paid a dozen children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders comforted themselves so much, but the restlessness in their hearts was not reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tree of Life is beginning to fear...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders suddenly thought of a problem: those Is there really no way to deal with the will of the forest from the invaders who are out of the door of the devil? Although in the past few decades, they have relied on the forest will to compete with the invaders, but this time he always has an ominous premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a cold heart, and immediately decided to spur the tree of life tomorrow, leaving this lively land, the entire tribe moved to the depths of Linhai! As for the opposition of the Druids, he has decided to ignore them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fades slowly, and the light green light in the sky is another day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lin Haizhong, Richard stood on the canopy of an old tree and looked at the giant tree that was striking up to hundreds of meters in the distance, showing a smile. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty kilometers from the Elf tribe, Richard’s team took the last break. Richard patted the head of the holy unicorn and asked, "Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Unicorn has already shown some fatigue, listening to Richard However, it was very dissatisfied with a long sigh, and the hooves slashed the shovel and became more energetic. In the past two days, it has always been against the will of the forest, and it has been a great success. Without it, it is impossible for all of them to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone is a strong man who has been killed for a long time, knowing that the great battle will come, so they eat and rest, stabilize their minds, and strive to adjust their status to the best. Nyris also put away a smile, the beautiful face of the unbelievable with a murderous, silently wiped the legendary axe in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that didn’t have a break was Richard. He checked the preparations of the soldiers one by one, especially the 黛 ,, almost nuanced. When Richard went to the next soldier, he looked at his busy figure and couldn't help thinking. Is this the leader? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what a leader should have." The voice of Agamemnon suddenly sounded next to Yan Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shocked and found that Agamemnon seemed to know what she was thinking, and that feeling made her panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the battle begins, don't leave me within ten meters." Agamemnon once again groaned. This time, Mei Mei bit her lip, and although she was reluctant, she nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understands that war is not a game, and cannot be burdened by others because of her own waywardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the game is approaching, but Richard’s heart has begun to have some tension. This embarrassment is different from the past. The level of combat strength of the participants is greatly improved. However, he has largely lost the soul connection that the commanding ability relies heavily on. His followers can be a whole, but what about others? This small-scale and high-intensity battle, the command has been secondary, and the key is the tacit understanding of the ability and cooperation of the strong players on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in the near future, Richard felt that he had lost all the feeling of mastery. This made him very uncomfortable. He found that he now hates this small-scale strong war. The war that really belongs to him is the strong one who uses the low-ranking soldiers to live and kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how uncomfortable, the war in front of us must still be played. What Richard can do is to make the preparation work meticulous and meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The break time is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha mentions the fate of the twins, hangs the elf knife that is not easy to carry on the back of the holy unicorn, and then faces the people, calmly said: Play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Shel, Splash, and Twilight, who are good at concealing action, set off first. Others spread out and advanced to the predetermined area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest has ushered in a quiet morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the tree in the crown of the tree of life, several elder elders are arguing fiercely. One party is a full seven Druids, while the other is only an elf elder and a Druid, which seems to be weak. The focus of the quarrel between the two sides is whether or not to migrate the tree of life to avoid the intruders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven Druids have a strong opposition. On the one hand, the support of the great elders with the ancient tree of Urano is not as weak as it seems. The ancient tree of war, Urano, is only in the tribe of the tree of life, but above any elder elder. On the other hand, the elder is the only elf who can communicate with the tree of life. If he wants to forcibly evoke the tree of life, no elf can stop it unless he kills the elder. But when the elders died, Zhu Bu. Ling Feng was still in the hands of Richard, and no one in the entire tribe could communicate with the tree of life. For a long time, the tree of life will stop releasing the breath of life, and will not secrete a spring of perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the tribe will go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the migration of the tree of life has serious consequences, and each migration consumes a lot of energy. The perpetual spring will not be secreted for at least ten years, and the release of life will be halved. The elf and the tree of life are symbiotic relationships. The elf tribe is the guardian of the tree of life, and the life of the tree of life is absorbed by the elves, which can speed up the elf power. The Fountain of Perseverance is even more important to the elves, and it is the key to raising the low fertility rate of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every other year to years, the tree of life will secrete a small spring of perseverance. The elves who drink the spring of perseverance will surely be able to conceive in the next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more powerful the tree of life, the more perpetual springs are secreted. Because of the nature of the tree of life, it will continue to attract some natural enemies, and must rely on the guardian elves to resist the natural enemies. If the guardian elves are not strong enough, the tree of life will not grow. The stronger the tree of life, the stronger it will be to attract natural enemies. The two sides have thus formed a wonderful relationship of mutual dependence and mutual help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the elders clashed fiercely, the forest gradually became bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher plundered from the crown of an old tree, and the swords of his swords were stained with blood. The body of an elf warrior hangs upside down on a branch, and blood is pouring from his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the kilometer, the splashes have put up the guide of the eternal sleep, and the figure has once again become looming, and does not go to the scheduled battlefield. Behind her is the body of a small team of genius hunters. They have just returned from hunting, and the prey on their shoulders is still warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further afield, the twilight is hanging on the canopy, and the feet are firmly pierced into the trunk, fixing the body. Her right hand grabbed the throat of an Elf whistle and made him unable to make any sound. The short knife in the left hand pierced his heart deeply. Twilight seriously looked at the face of the elf who was close at hand, and the expression seemed innocent and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of life is constantly being introduced into her body through annihilation, so that the twilight feels warm. The elf man in front of him quickly dried up and gradually became a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvesting the essence of life is tantamount to a big meal for twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life is too big, it is difficult to survive the tall tree species around it, so hundreds of meters around the tree of life is a green lawn. The elves like to take a rest in this area. The Green Sen Elf is also a race that enjoys enjoying life. At this moment, they are scattered on the lawn in twos and threes, enjoying the joy of life in their own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, without warning, a large cloud cloud condensed quietly, covering the elves who had passed half a rest. Then a group of electric light was dumped from the thundercloud, turning the vast region into a thundering world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight-level magic thunderstorms, coverage and lethality have risen sharply in the Greenson plane, and the numerous lightnings that landed have no locking effect, but Any elf below level 10 is a one-shot kill. Elves below the fifteenth level must be seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a thunderstorm, the elves are in a panic, and the death and injury are heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intruders armed with different shapes and teeth appear in the vision of the Green Sen. The elves suddenly panicked, and a small group of elf warriors rushed to the invaders fearlessly, but they were hit by a group of fears, and most of them fell into extreme fear. Two warriors who resisted fear became alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon swept the giant sword in the hands, and the two elves warriors even took the weapon into eight segments, not forgetting to praise: "The timing is perfect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feared elf warrior has almost no resistance, and the royal guards like the wolf-like tiger suddenly rushed out and cut them down one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
