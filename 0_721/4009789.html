			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the team stayed in the town of Giant Wood, including the town The only hotel. Accompanied by the Dragon Master Lina and the mayor, Richard rushed to the death camp in the depths of the forest overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde training camp is located deep in the forest and consists of seven scattered communities, the nearest one being nearly 100 kilometers from the edge of the forest. There is no road to walk at all. Even if the mayor of the giant wood leads the way, the three people spent a full three hours. When they arrived at the first training camp, it was already midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This training camp is trained as a warrior, or a warrior who also uses strength as a core element. When entering a training camp through a row of sloping wooden fences, Richard was a bit hard to believe that this small village, made up of dozens of simple wooden houses, was the famous death camp in Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Schiller, the head of the death camp, stood in front of him, Richard finally confirmed that it was indeed his destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller is a medium-sized man with a short grassy hair, no magic armor on his body, and only a humble knife on his waist. The scabbard is ash, as if it was not scrubbed. His clothes are clean and have no other features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, standing in front of Schiller, there is always a feeling of being needled, and even his eyes have to be smashed. In the end, even the eyes were slightly sour, almost shed tears. Just then, a gentle magical fluctuation shrouded Richard's body, offsetting the feeling of acupuncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cold voice from Dragon Master Lina: "Schiller! What do you mean by this, are you impatient?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller laughed casually, his face relaxed and casual, saying: "Nothing, just want to see what the young master who is ready to pick the best warrior under my command is like. Master Li. It looks very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master Lina sneered a few times and said, "What is the strength of Master Licha? What do you think is this death?" The training camp is yours? You are just a matter of doing things. Are you staying in the forest for a long time, and even your brain is broken?" Her words were so straightforward that she didn't leave her face in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Schiller’s face passed a layer of black air, although still laughing, but it was as dark as the lead cloud before the storm: “This is Goley. The land of the Earl of Azerbaijan. And Lina, how do I remember that you are not my opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air immediately filled with a strong smell of gunpowder. Richard quietly watched the two men bickering, and there was no expression on his face. It was just that the right hand seemed to inadvertently bounce the sleeves of the mage’s robe, a flash of light on the lace that barely noticed, and a magical array attached to it. The "Element Curse" has been ready to start. But between the conflict between Schiller and the Dragon Master, this magical array can play a big role, and Richard himself does not hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina suddenly smiled slyly and said, "I am just a mage, how could it be your opponent of this dark guard? Do you want to change? A few people come, who do you want to choose? Modrede forgive you for not dare, how about Feng? Or Achilles? Or else two steel blocks of Kailan and Caper? Or are we together? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller snorted, his face was even more ugly, his eyes turned a few times, he wanted to say something, and he finally stopped. Of course, the 13th-level knights of Gordon are not monolithic, but they are always united when they are foreign. And there is a layer of meaning in the words of the Dragon Master. Even if more than half of the knights are not Schiller's opponents, but any two of the knights join forces, Schiller will have to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
