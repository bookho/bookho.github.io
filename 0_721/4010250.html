Even so, but younger In the voice of Ruyi, there was a faint uneasiness, and there was also confusion in his eyes. He is very talented and wise, but he has already roughly guessed what the elders mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhu Bu, you are very smart, you should know that in this forest, the real protagonist is not our elf and druid, but the world tree and all The tree of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." The young Druid nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf elders slowly said: "Our elves can hardly leave the tree of life. Once the tree of life is lost, our people are hard to multiply, and the soldiers will not change. Strong, Druids will even slowly degenerate. It can be said that the tree of life is the pillar of the elf's existence. And what can we bring to the tree of life? We can only guard them and drive away their natural enemies. Say, the elf can't leave the tree of life, and the tree of life doesn't necessarily need our elves. Do you understand now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you mean, we are attached The tree of life has chosen to give up on us?" Zhu Bu looked shocked, this news for him, it is too shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We and the tree of life are not a close two-way connection. Now, this tree of life has clearly found a more appropriate and more powerful guardian. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Druid screamed: "Invaders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder elders He nodded heavily and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does the tree of life do this? It will break the original structure of the forest, is it...it wants to be the world tree?" In a sentence, Zhu Bu could not help but suck a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we are all trying to become strong, the tree of life wants to be a tree of the world, what a strange thing?" The elders seemed to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhubu slowly lowered his head and said, "I just... can't accept the intruder and become the guardian of the tree of life."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders sighed again and said, "This is reality. Our role in the tree of life has become dispensable. I think, what we need to do now is Like the tree of life, which proves its value to Richard, it also proves our value to the Tree of Life and Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" Zhu Bu jumped excitedly. Get up and say: "In this way, have we not lost even the last dignity and faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders smiled bitterly and said, "Dignity? When we have survived, we have lost our dignity. And what about faith? The tree of life we ​​have been faith in has now abandoned us and chosen a new guardian. In fact, it surrendered to the invaders. The source of our faith has done this. What can we do besides following it? Leave the tree of life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu . Zhengzhu Spirit, he is Druid, it is clear that the tribe left the tree of life, alone in the forest deep end. The entire tribe will surely wither and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which dignity and belief you just mentioned are more important than the continuation of the life of the whole family?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this heavy topic, the young Druid certainly can't give an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I don't stop the people from going to the sermon of the goddess." The elder elder looked out the window and said slowly: "Since we have Losing faith, then if the people are willing, it may not be a bad thing to choose a new kind of faith. Even if it is a belief from the opposite side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young De Ruyi is silent. He can feel the loss of life in the tree of life, and know that the tree of life almost concentrates all the vitality of life that can be mobilized on Richard. This is a clear fact that the elf has been abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between dignity and survival, Zhu Bu himself can make a relaxed choice, born with pride, so that he is not afraid to face death, but That only refers to him. If you want to add Kampot, Yidi, the elders and even the whole family, Zhu Bu feels an unprecedented weakness. This is not the decision he can make. He has not had the courage to let the whole family accompany him to the destruction of no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has returned to the base city with his spoils and captives. Since meditation has been delayed for a few days, at this moment, Nyris and Agamemnon in the base city have already done all the preparatory work, just waiting for Richard to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to Noland, Richard’s preparations were lengthy and surprising, and it was not completed until one day later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team continued to step into the portal, and then appeared in the transmission array of the Eternal Dragon Hall. This time, Richard brought a lot of special things, several green elves, and several living crows. However, after getting out of the transmission array, Richard immediately discovered that the crows are like humans, and they need to consume the same magic crystal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard couldn’t help but sneak a sigh of relief. It’s obviously a huge expense to bring these things to Faro. Li sighed and ordered the green scorpion captives and woodpeckers to take care of themselves and walked to the family floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floating island of Archimonde, the melodious bells began to sound, and a total of seven sounds were heard, representing the return of the founding patriarch of Richard. The number of bells means the power position of the characters who come to the floating island. The seven sounds are the welcome bells for the patriarchs. Obviously, at least the Akmons on the floating islands now regard Richard as the patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bell rang, at the door of a room in the castle, Faschi exclaimed, and immediately retracted the door and threw the door down. He was locked up in a hurry, then leaned back against the door, and his heart slammed. She is very skeptical that Richard will keep his promise, as long as he has not met, even if he has not seen himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi is now unable to meet Richard, because she is back empty-handed. Ellie did not let her bring the structure back, and did not intend to fulfill the idea of ​​becoming a Richard companion. The count was unremarkably hesitant, but placed Faschi in a very awkward position. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But considering the lack of a strong town on the floating island, and Faschi felt that he was awkward to Richard, so he received the report from Richard. After the magic message, I still came to the floating island with a hard head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard does not seem to care about her returning, but after talking briefly with the old butler, she put herself in the family library. Start looking for something in this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard returned to Noland, the Joseph family’s floating islands came to a few mysterious guests, dressed in ordinary aristocratic clothing, face and There are no robes and hoods, but that's because their faces that are exposed outside are fake. Several mysterious guests were introduced into a dedicated war room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already two large magic sandboxes, one of which is a seemingly ordinary aristocratic collar, and the other on the sandbox is an unknown plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the map layer of Noland, you can see that several huge arrows are coming from several directions and merged into the territory of a noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the sand table, standing a young man, thinking about something in the sandbox, always adjust it, so one of the huge arrows corresponds Moved. After repeated adjustments several times, his tight brows were relaxed and he was very satisfied. Then he took out a stack of thick lists and began a careful inspection. Listed on the list are a team of formed soldiers and war equipment. Each item is followed by a dense label. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it with concentration and occasionally coughed a few times. The bright magic light shines on his face, but leaves a few small shadows in the handsome face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond, I don’t know when, he rushed back from the family plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of footsteps in the long corridor, and the Duke of Old Joseph walked along the promenade with a few guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two warriors did not know where to appear, stopped in front of a group of people, the weapon was squirted, pointed to the ground, and the burly figure was almost completely blocked. The channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Joseph took out a token and inserted it into the wall of the institution, and pressed his hand on a crystal jade wall, a moment later jade The light of the wall turned soft and pale yellow, and the two warriors disappeared like a blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph took the guest behind him and continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few guests were not surprised by the arrangement of this alchemy technique. Although Joseph is the patriarch of the family, the appearance cannot be regarded as the only way to identify. . The wizard's illusion, the phantom of the warlock, and the camouflage of the assassin's killer can make a flawless look. Therefore, in the truly affordable giants, the family is heavily tested by magic, or the scan of the body's blood, and the appearance is completely ignored. The most advanced test is a direct examination of the soul, which is almost impossible to make mistakes, but it is not something that can be done with money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical instruments that can do soul inspections are mostly legendary and can reach the level of artifacts. For example, Archimonde's family cemetery, if there is not enough strong Akmon blood, can not enter. Without the corresponding strength, if you climb up in the volcano, you will feel the burning pain, but you will die immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph took the guests through a large gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hall with a thousand square meters, and nearly a hundred or young, or young people are busy. The magical images on the surrounding walls continue to outline a magic map of different planes, each with detailed force distribution and running route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a raised high platform in each corner of the hall, sitting on a few old generals with a murderous murder, and their desks are equipped with more than one The magic video device can continuously adjust the switching content according to their needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is divided into four large sections by the aisle, each of which is neatly placed with semi-independent workshops, and young people wearing military uniforms bury their heads In front of the workbench, desperately trying to figure out something to the map. On many workbenches, there are also magical imaging devices that can project a miniature magic map. Such a workbench is half as large as the ordinary one, and the people sitting are obviously more experienced and more experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
