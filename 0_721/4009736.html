There is only one request for me. If you feel that you can win, then... then please take me two months. Two months is enough. At that time, Stevenson will be cleared of dark blue, and I will lose the qualification of the teacher because I can't afford the tuition. In fact, the teacher's attitude is obvious, it will only Leave you a student. My family has already sold me to Soram, but I don't want to be tied up with Stevenson. As long as you help me through this difficult time, I will... Like Irene, I will try my best to survive in the dark blue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth." The mountain and the sea stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little bit smirking, and the atmosphere of seriousness and dignity was ruined by her. He tapped on the mountain and the sea, and then continued to stare at Minnie. This little trick is that Richard can do it, change another person, and most of them have not touched her head, they will first find that their arms are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? I have taken care of you, and what good is it for me? The result that can be seen now is to increase the Soram family. My hatred," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini straightened her body and showed her tempting curve, then seriously said: "I can put Stevenson so far. I am told you all about the preparations. I also know about the material and financial support programs of the Soram family. In addition... During the period of receiving me, I am... yours, what can you do? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth." The mountain and the sea slept very hard, and began to make a soft snoring, but did not forget to evaluate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn’t help but raise my hand and want to knock on her head, but still let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini immediately screamed and said: "Is the hatred between you and Soram still small? I don't care much about it. Not to mention the eternal family. The interests, there is no eternal hatred. Such a small matter, the overall situation is insignificant, even if they only look at the face of the Marquis of Gordon, they will not specifically ask. If Stevenson loses the game, only Give up the blood to learn from Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz himself can only make two or three three-level magic lines, and even the big builders are not counted. By his words, Stevenson is at all However, the threshold of the second-level constructor. Only when he becomes a dragon-roller, can he create a specific three-level magical structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "But in any case, can he not be a builder? This ending is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not the same. The Soram family has invested too much for him. If Can not become a big package as teacher, then life must be under family control service, there is no status at all. "Minnie reasoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood up: "In any case, you are still a constructor and a wife of a big aristocrat. This ending is very good. It is much better than staying in the dark blue, so I can't help you, let's go. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! No, why? I don't want to be his wife, the paper marriage contract sold me to the Soram family! And you also have Responsibility, because your Viscount of the Archimonde family, my father sold me to the Soram family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his eyebrows and said faintly: "So, do you want to pursue my responsibility?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini's face changed, then she lowered her head, and her tears could not stop flowing. She whispered, "How can I investigate you? As for my father, he only wants to have another Acker. Mond called. Ok, I know that I have a lot of sorry for you in the past, but this game is equally important to you? If you still can see it So, as long as you like, I will be yours in the future. Is that okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has opened the door to the residential area and said, "I have no interest in what Stevenson is doing, and it is the same for you. So I can't help you, sorry. I have passed me now. The time for meditation, please go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini double carrying her luggage, walking out of the gate of the residential area, and behind her, the heavy metal door is heavy Closed and made a low vibrato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! I hate you!" Minnie screamed at the metal door, then fell to the ground and burst into tears with her knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with a thick metal door, Minnie’s voice is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth..." The mountain and the sea said vaguely, then felt that they slept very uncomfortably, propped up their bodies and barely opened their eyes, only to find out Minnie has disappeared. "Hey? Her, are you driving her away? She can tell the truth afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silent for a moment, sighed, Then nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really worried!" The mountain and the sea stood up, stretching the body hard, but the eyelids could not hold up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed again and said, "Some hatred is unforgivable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mountain and Haydn were sober, and this time they tried to open their eyes and looked at Richard seriously. They said, "You are not like a 13-year-old guy. It looks like a 130-year-old man!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helpless and had to explain it again: "Maybe I have encountered a lot of things since I was young..." He now has a general understanding of wisdom. Role, but this is a reason that cannot be explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea yawned with a mouth shut, and interrupted him: "Know, know! You have said it several times, nothing more than a national enemy." I hate my children's love! Norland's men are these routines! So, you come to be my man, what are the enemies and I will help you report, how do you see it? According to your Nolan, my sister, I Someone wants someone to have money and money, and the background has a background!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
