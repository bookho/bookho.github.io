However, the Duke of Mensa should have been thundering, but this time it was suddenly silent, but the movement of the troops in the territory was unusually frequent<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Peter Peter is an angry anger on the floating island, and his army is constantly mobilized. The army of the Bear Peter family is also mobilized. However, they have not been able to restore their strength and are obviously unable to stop the strong march of the Anan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Peter Peter continued to issue various orders, but one half of them were not effectively executed, and some were still put on hold. Now the family has been quite vocal about the Duke. In particular, when someone asked the Duke of Peter Peter to prepare for Ying Qiqi and let Men Sathorn and Bear Peter also reveal the sound of the Duke’s doubts at the Family Presbyterian Church, it’s getting bigger and bigger<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to unwritten conventions The giants of the seven-story floating island must send troops to prevent the new family from entering the shishade. The sixth floor and even the higher giants should stand by and participate appropriately according to their own interests and preferences. In the past, this means giving material support and At the regular meeting of the House of Lords, I expressed my preference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the understanding of Richard, the scope of this appropriate participation is obviously very broad, so it was only fifty shortly after the completion of the mobilization of the Anan family. The famous knight and one hundred elite knights joined the Annan family's marching sequence from the Black Rose Castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news came out of the floating world As a result, the sharp strength of the Anan family is almost equal to doubled and who is willing to come up with so many costume knights and Anan family. In particular, Richard’s death fights, especially in the case of Richard’s construction of the knights, are more frequent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the giants’ question, Richard’s representative on the floating island An extremely tough announcement in the House of Noble It is said that only the two families of Mensa and Joseph give up the intervention. This intervention refers to all direct and indirect behaviors. Richard will give up supporting the Anan family. Otherwise, Archimonde will not hesitate to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; Joseph is still good, they didn't intend to intervene on a large scale because it didn't have any benefit to them, but Mensa couldn't sit still. The family's army had already mobilized the Duke of Mensa to publicly say that he would die. Out of the nobility’s reputation and honour, there is no room for Men’s retreat. So the Duke of Mensa made an impassioned speech in the House of Lords, once again emphasizing his position and saying that he will mobilize all the troops<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone wants a war, then give him a war<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the strong Duke of Mensa, the messenger left by Richard only left the House of Lords with a few laughs. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, Farotong’s plane to Norland’s plane was built in the Black Rose Castle and opened to the Greenson’s plane portal. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on this day, the eternal dragon palace and Archimonde signed a one-year protection period officially expired, the Dragon Knight began to evacuate the floating island of Archimonde for a time to float The guards on the island seem to be extremely empty. There are only a few dozen knights in addition to Faschi. In addition, they can rely on the defense of the six-layer floating island and various defense facilities.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard does not intend to add more guards. In the future, he may also bring Faschi to the floating island. It is a symbol of its own value. It is the qualification of sacrifice. It is not safe or not. Depending on how many guards on the island, but the strength of Richard's overall strength<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gordon and the thirteen knights are still I am afraid that there will be only a bunch of old, weak and sick on the floating island. There will be no idea that anyone will dare to play the floating island. As long as the structure of the built-in knight is not damaged, no one will be bored to capture his floating island. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the crazy Archimonde, there is no way for the giants to use the top-level sacrifices to jump to the floating island rankings to damage the fringe facilities of other families’ floating islands. There will be no <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation will change dramatically in the coming days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anan The family finally began to enter the vassal. In a series of battles, they showed a powerful force and a formidable battle. Every step of the advance will leave blood-stained footprints. However, people did not see it in the army of the Anan family. The figure of the Knights of the Knights and the Knights of the Frontiers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people speculated, Richard walked out of behind the plane in the plane of the Black Rose Castle. Also followed by more than a dozen riding knights and hundreds of knights, these knights are not elite but All reached the thirteenth level, the latest creation of the 9th-order mother's nest<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a super elite cavalry of more than 2,000 people gathered in the Black Rose Castle. Nearly a thousand of the troops in the army were also attached to the cavalry of Elliott and were also borrowed by Richard<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Ellie’s troops are not as good as the Knights of Richard, but they have a high degree of military literacy. On the other hand, Richard is also going to take a shock to see the oldest soldiers who have followed Alice’s longest time. See if his self-proclaimed King of Archimonde has enough leadership to the strength of this family name<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, two thousand iron rides rushing out of the Black Rose Castle directly Throwing to the territory of the Mensa family<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, Richard led the iron rider out of the ghosts and the soldiers were inconsistent and full of people to appreciate his style of use < Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland is not a Faro Richard and will not have a one-way vision on the vast battlefield. The elite bat can indeed provide him with an unparalleled advantage. The reconnaissance of the Saskatchewan sanctuary is also difficult to stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the situation has developed into the eternal war of the two great giants of the League Will not be publicly involved in the quicksand and her guardians are not accompanying<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard and Mensa really started to fight, they only saw his really shocking side on the battlefield<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The troops entering the battle Richard became an incomparably sophisticated machine that relentlessly harvested the life of the enemy. The command of Richard seems to be passed to every knight in the first place. The result of this command is to let the distinct Mensa army Excellent and still in the battlefield of the main battlefield has become the defeat of Mensa. Under the same military force, Richard often defeats Mensa with a few back and forth attacks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Four days and nine wars, Richard will win every battle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menza’s casualty figures are expanding at an alarming rate and Richard’s costume knight is also riding Riding down the two sides is a different strategy. The Mensa family always hides the core of the family. The Cavaliers do not seem to care about the casualty figures of the knights. They only defeat the opponents at the fastest speed and maximize the blood loss of Mensa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast land, Richard With the tens of thousands of majors of the Mensa family, as long as Mensa dare to divide the soldiers below 10,000, Richard will fight without hesitation and defeat the opponent. If the Mensa is too heavy, Richard will ignore it and instead use the cavalry. Super-strong machine power is destroyed in the territory of Mensa's home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa had once thought of a pawn in the Black Rose Castle but was discouraged. The Black Rose Castle is now connected to Richard’s private plane. Who knows how many troops are hidden inside, even if the castle is now stationed? Five thousand warriors are not tens of thousands of people who will be able to attack for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, direct attack on Archimonde’s traditional territory and family symbolic war will not be done from Li The alliance between Ali and Alizee further expands the group of madmen who will become civil wars after becoming a floating island giant. For the outsiders, they will only be more crazy. The local lords of the peninsula and even the distant Goliath have the possibility to participate in the war. It’s hard to say that it’s easy to get into the city of Ashan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I’m letting Richard’s activity in Men’s territory estimate and so on. The countless rich territories of the family have also turned into scorched earth. It’s not worth the loss.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the war continues to break out four times in five days. Richard is still invincible. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four games In the war, Richard lost nearly a hundred cavalry, including more than ten costume knights, while Mensa died in the thousands of the most elite warriors. All the experienced generals in the family lost in the hands of Richard. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the Mensa family army war dead have already passed the most powerful and most combative force. There are also more than 10,000 soldiers who can’t recover even if they have a wound. The formation of the Knights of the battlefield Mensa is still unscathed at this time, and the damage of the construction of the Knights has exceeded 30 rides.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mensa still dare Take your own Knights of the Knights and Richard to fight hard. The remaining number of Knights and Knights of the Knights can still swallow the Menza family's knights and Richard has already set out that he is not afraid of losing the Knights. The attitude of Mensa can't be done <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mensa people suddenly found that they would fight like this. All the elite troops in the family will be spelled out at that time to build the Knights. Matching a bunch of second-line troops will also greatly reduce the combat effectiveness<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They realized that Richard had lost blood to Mensa at the expense of the elite and the knight. In the incomparable battlefield command of Richard, the battle-to-loss ratio of both sides reached an astonishing number of blood loss. The speed of blood loss has been severe enough. From the very beginning, Richard’s gaze was not on the makeup knight of Mensa but only wanted to destroy their living power<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
