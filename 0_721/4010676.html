She wanted to take this sentence back to Neris’s face and put it in his mouth, forcing him to swallow the powerless words, but Meck Si Hao is a strong sanctuary and a noble blood. He can't do anything that ignores iron. It is Mecks' heart, and he really has to admit that Neri's appearance is indeed a level higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she is the kind of woman who needs to eat by her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s attack was unusually hot, and it just hit Mecks’s weakness, so she couldn’t help but counterattack, The anger can only be swallowed back into the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gimbee finally stood up, pulled Mex back, pressed it in her seat and said softly in her ear: "For the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex’s eyes spurt and roared: "But you heard it, what he said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "For the empire." This time, the Earl of Golden Baye added a tone, and Meek snorted and no longer refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of Mex, the Earl of Kimbey was sitting in front of Nyres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris sneered: "This time for what, don't tell me that it is also for the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kimbey said with a smile: "Four princes, this time is for your destiny, because I think that compared with sleeping with no one, you will feel that you are staying next to our Miss Mex. Heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count gave Niris a surprise, he wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t smile: "You are a joke..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a joke." Kimbee said calmly: "I heard that the standard of the second batch of turbidity is determined by the blood, the more powerful the blood. The more people, the easier it is to be selected, Your Highness, your looks and blood are all temporary choices, so do you think you will be missed?" Speaking of this, Kimbe Ye paused and smiled: "It is turbid. If you are an adult, you can also remind him at the appropriate time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris stood up and was shocked and angry: "You...you are mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold Baye also stood up, first elegant One ceremony, I said, "I originally thought that in the dictionary of the real aristocracy, there is no such thing as despicable, because it has already been integrated into our blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese turned cold and said, "I have never been threatened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The temperament should not be a vocabulary in the aristocratic dictionary, are you willing to become Uncertain playthings, IMHO, because of the blood of His Royal Highness, I am afraid that it will not be long before he will be killed by the undecided. In addition, I have heard some bad rumors, it is said that I am not sure about you. The mother is deeply hated, and with the temper of squatting, if there is a reason, she will choose to annihilate the whole family. Even if there is no suitable reason, the reason can always be found." The Earl of Kimbeye finished and sat back. Hands crossed fingers and leisurely, and looked at the four emperors gracefully. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s face is blue and silent, although the Earl of Kimbe Bay is already openly coerced, but Nyris is unable to attack, the other party’s words Red/naked straightforward, the reality that he always wanted to escape was brought to the skylight. Once the election of such a damn thing really fell on his head, Count Kimbeye may be his only retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, seeing that Nyris was not ready to speak again, Count Kimbey stood up and calmly said: "His Highness, now still In a few days, you can think about it again. Although there is no war, but we have a throne in the Millennium Empire, it is not too late to keep your mother. It is not too late, we should go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris stood still, not moving, like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexus suddenly moved in front of him, reached out and touched his face and smiled: "It really grows good, I I like it, I will set you up this time, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Earl of Kimbey leaves, Nyris grows a sigh of relief On the stone table, his punch was extremely heavy, and he did not use it to protect himself. His hands were flesh and blood. He let the blood flow for a while. Then he stood up and packed up the wound and the stone table. Blood, left the courtyard, and walked into the Royal Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the night was already deep, and the library was quiet and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris was alone in the library and finally turned to a very old book with the cover of "God's Legacy: On the Blood ", he found a table to sit down, through the light of magic lights, began to look through this thick and big book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, in the chapter "The Fusion and Variation of Blood Veins", it is written that when the Golden Moon River encounters the Dark Ray Titan, it may have a double blood. Offspring, there is a small chance that a descendant with a higher level of unknown blood will be produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is written by a legendary figure: Russell, in his time, Russell was one of the few legendary mages in the entire plane. One, but what he remembers for people is not the tyrannical magic that is enough to straddle the major planes, but his pioneering achievements in blood theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest work of his life is the "God of the Gods" in the hands of Nyris at the moment, this book systematically tells the birth of blood, Rich or thin, and many problems such as fusion and variation, although many of Russell's theories remain at the stage of conjecture, they still do not detract from his greatness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred years later, Noland’s understanding of the blood did not advance much on the basis of Russell, so many ancient traditions, like The pure blood marriage of the Kemond family is still common in most families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "God of the Gods", the fusion and variation of the blood is a different chapter. In this chapter, Russell gives more than ten A variety of blood combination and promotion programs, many of which are mentioned in the blood of the program, have not appeared in the Russell era, this is not Russell’s nonsense, but because he is a master of prophetic magic, so In the long river of fate, Russell glimpsed many future pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many blood fusion and promotion programs listed by Russell has been confirmed, and the ratio is already high enough to make people crazy, so for those The bloody collocation scheme listed in the book, even if the chance is small, there are always people who are willing to pay for it and try it. The Millennium Empire is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Nyris leaned back, no matter whether his head hit the window sill or the bookshelf, raised his arm to cover his eyes, he Now I feel like I am a stallion for breeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek's golden moon river, the Queen's dark Titans, combined with Nyris's dark Lei Titan, will have a greater chance to create a powerful descendant of the bleeding vein. In any historical family, the blood heritage is It is a top priority, but Niris, one of the parties, will not feel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he accepted the education of the prince from an early age. He did not naively think that breeding is the end of the matter. If the breeding is successful, waiting for him will be more red/naked. / With the requirements, if the breeding is unsuccessful, the potential of his pure blood thunder ruin, at least the starting point of the legendary strong, will be the goal of many people to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s bloody fascination is too early, his power is not strong enough to protect himself, but the Dark Ray Titan is also the "God of the Gods" The blood of the listed name, the pressure can not help directly into the second stage of the blood, can not be hidden under the eyes of many of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Philip, who could have given him shelter, died at this time. In a twinkling of an eye, Nyris was like a piece. The fat meat placed in the wilderness is surrounded by hungry wolves, and the Millennium Empire is only the first to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dawning, the night outside the window is extraordinarily deep, and Niris, who is sitting in the library, suddenly has a chill, and feels the night’s forest. cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Richard has appeared in the Black Rose Castle, carrying a large number of knights, and once again entered the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard appeared in the long-lost Lanshui Oasis City, there was a roaring laugh in consciousness immediately, and then the iconic gross voice of Gangde: "Hey, you are finally back. If you don't come back, I may not be able to enter the Iron Triangle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no time for Richard. Answer, another soft and soft voice followed: "Lee master, I think I should be with you, always working for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sound sounds strange, and it is hundreds of kilometers away from Richard. Richard has to think about it, only to remember that this is the voice of Zonghu. After the son of the god accepts the soul contract, he can also In a certain distance, Richard directly communicated with consciousness, but in Richard’s memory, Zonghu should be a very unruly person, and the nature is moody and likes to betray, how suddenly it becomes so gracious, and even some Charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
