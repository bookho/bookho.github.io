			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of annihilation came and hit Richard’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male voice in the tower is the most screaming, as if you are experiencing an unprecedented **! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slap-like male voice rang again, this time revealing deep exhaustion, even the sound is intermittent, like an old man who has just been over-indulgent. "What a perfect annihilation light, this is the ultimate destruction, and the ultimate beauty! This is the miracle of the whole world... Damn! How can it be like this??"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still floating in the air, staring at his chest. There is a small hole in his clothes, only the size of the pinhole, which is the trace of the light of the annihilation, and the true size of the light of annihilation. Through the hole, you can see the sparkling radiance inside, that is the fate crystal plate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of annihilation did not penetrate the fate crystal plate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard seems to understand something. It's no wonder that I have tried several times before, and I can't break this fate. Since there were two crystal plates in the first two, Richard never thought about the problems. Now I understand that this piece of fat crystal plate can't even wear the light of annihilation. He wants to be able to crush it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this fate of crystal is the real will never be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, the voice also reveals an uncontrollable shock, trembling and screaming: "Destiny fulcrum! Actually it is the fulcrum of fate! The world's strongest substance There is no power to destroy the fate of the fulcrum! This...this thing really exists! How can it be on you? This is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He sneered and said: "Nothing is impossible! Today is your end, accept the fate, dear world's first great thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li The hands raised and the blue arc of countless jumps suddenly appeared around the body. Hundreds of blue arcs converge in the middle of Richard's hands, suddenly igniting a deep blue light spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real name of Richard’s destruction is constantly running, and soon reached its peak. But this time, this is no longer the end. After seeing the light of annihilation with his own eyes, Richard has a new understanding of the rules of destruction. Although it is not as pure as the light of annihilation, it is not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the destructive power continues to be purified, the power of additional rules becomes stronger and stronger, and the blue brilliance finally reaches the critical point of excitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, there are faint hymns echoing, and there seem to be countless devils roaring, that is the rule resonating with the power of destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very thin dark blue beam spans the void and hits the reaper's metal tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep blue sigh! It’s a deep blue sigh! How can you use this! This doesn't...no..." Sharp voice Suddenly, it is like a hen caught in his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue sighs of blue light disappeared, and the metal towers made a lot of squeaking sounds, the surface was suddenly covered with cracks, all the reaper battleships coming in and out They hovered in the air, lost all their power, and never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing remarkable about the deep blue sigh, but the power is so great that almost the entire reaper's base is scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly didn’t give the reaper any breathing space. He sent it several times in a row and rushed to the metal barrier. There are now large cracks in the metal barriers, all of which can be rushed into the entrance. Richard was about to step in and suddenly looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, a huge portal has emerged, which is actually the portal of the Shadow Legion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the current Richard, the Shadow Corps has long lost its threat. The real name of his redemption is like the sun. Under the light of the sun, the powerful shadow will melt like snow. If there is any change in the Shadow Legion, then Richard can destroy the formed army by simply launching the real name of Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know why the Shadow Corps appeared at this time. Before that, he did not feel anything like a beacon around him. Moreover, shadow creatures have a very limited impact on the reaper, unless the reaper with flesh and blood is damaged by the shadow creature, and the pure metal warship is immune to the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware of the Shadow Corps." Richard still sent a message to the faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, they don't dare to get close to FS."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and no longer managed to transfer the metal directly into the portal of the shadow creature. A crack in the barrier, all the way to the end, and then a heavy punch on the metal wall blocking the road ahead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch is silent, but within the range of hundreds of meters around Richard, all the metal parts that can be dismantled are disintegrated into countless parts, Tintin Dangdang When the land fell on the ground, Richard immediately removed a hall from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land units of countless reapers poured into the hall, but they are no longer dangerous to Richard. A large tetrahedral shadow appeared in Li Zhou’s body. Most of the high-energy beam was deflected on the top. The powerful metal kinetic energy bullets were also shot into the mud, and they could not move forward in the virtual shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is walking like a stroll in metal barriers. Wherever he goes, the reapers are disintegrated, whether they are fighting units or buildings. For parts. And after becoming a part, they completely lost their vitality, and no one can be combined into a new combat unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle, the voice rang again, and with the progress of Richard, it continued to linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, these are my latest combat units, They will definitely take you... damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at me these cute little babies...oh, no!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Why, why can't my little babies move again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard finally replied: "Because I know as much about you as the Reaper. Even more than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's impossible! I am their designer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course maybe! Because I am their enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a dialogue, Richard opened a thick wall with a blue fire and finally entered a huge hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is a few thousand meters, and it is a small world. Inside, there are precision machinery for unknown purposes, huge crystals shining, and chaotic runes of countless rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the hall is a transparent drum that runs through the ceiling and floor, filled with a light red solution. In the middle of the solution, a solitary brain, a human brain, floats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the brain and said, "It seems that this is your true face. Are we chatting or directly ruining you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice rang again, this time it was no longer a sharp madness, but a low-pitched, unspeakable elegance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, there was an image of a human middle-aged man. He was also a wizard costume, and every detail was meticulous. The man has deep blue-gray eyes and a large secret silver ring in his left hand. The pattern on the ring is very familiar. It is the symbol of the scholar wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Richard a mage ceremony and said, "Re-introduction, I am Plato, Plato. Solomon. It is also the first construction of Solomon Castle." And the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solomon?!" Although there is speculation, when the conjecture becomes a reality, Richard is still hard to avoid shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has always been an endless hostile relationship with scholars and wizards. Richard has tried every means to find their weaknesses, use all means to counterattack and attack their power. But Richard has to admit that the scholar mages are indeed the most difficult enemy. They are actually somewhat similar to the current Richard. The magic of the surface is not strong, but the real combat power is extremely powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the scholar mages, the rich knowledge is a certain degree of rule power, which greatly compensates for the lack of their ontological power. If it is not the indifference of the scholars to the entire Noland people, only knowledge is a worthy university student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the pioneer of this path, Solomon himself is a true master of the past. It now appears that Solomon's creation of the sacred magical suit is just a negligible part of his accomplishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as far as the current relationship is concerned, the more Solomon’s achievements, the more difficult it is for Richard to be happy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, the radiant radiance of the two eyes squinted and scanned the image of Solomon in a real field of view, saying, "Solomon Solomon, so I should be very grateful. You, and the scholars of Solomon Castle, have given me gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you got it wrong. Now those guys in Solomon Castle and me It’s all the same. They may have gone a little bit faster than the average person, but there is no essential difference, it’s still just a reptile.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solomon waved his hand in disapproval, just like driving away an inconspicuous mosquito and saying, "They don't know what I am doing. I am not interested in their tricks and cleverness. I said, I have already The first martial art of all living beings has been reached throughout the ages: I control the reaper! And you can control the fascination here, and block the attack of the annihilation light, even standing in front of me, this is the soul of life. Two greats! So you, already have it with me Qualifications."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon extended his hand to Richard and said, "You can attach to me and work together to accomplish an unprecedented great cause!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the brain floating in the solution and sneered and said: "What great work? Is the so-called great cause, is it like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon smiled, and even Richard had to admit that it was an elegant human being, his smile had the charm that ordinary people could not match, perhaps from his wisdom. Perhaps from his madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon looked at the crystal container and said, "Life is not in form, but in the soul. The reason why I keep my brain here is to commemorate ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commemoration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, to commemorate my previous ethnic identity As for now, what kind of life form does not matter to me. In the eyes of the devil, I am a demon; in the eyes of the elves, I am an elf. Of course, in your opinion, I am still a human being. I can be all races. In fact, I am not of any race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
