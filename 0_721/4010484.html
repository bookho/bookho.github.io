			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his hand and the crowd calmed down, waiting for the fate of the verdict Most people in the eyes are desperate, but the number of fully armed fighters is even more than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may also have mad believers in the Highland God of War, it doesn't matter, you can come out and come to my right hand, you are just ordinary people, and Those priests are different. I don't ask you to change your letter, but the price of being a devout believer will be turned into a slave. Other people can continue to live here if they swear to abandon the beliefs of the gods of highland. I can get the identity of the civilians. I can guarantee this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard immediately provoked a shackle in the crowd, which is an unprecedented condition, any People have not heard of the conquerors. In the history of Faro, religious wars are even more cruel than the alien wars. When a religious city is captured, often the residents of the city will be killed to eliminate from the roots. Another reason for the believers of the other gods is that the mad believers are basically difficult to change, but the beliefs of the shallow believers cannot be distinguished. I don’t know if they are true believers or if they are false believers.  of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of changing beliefs is too long and uncertain, so slaughter has become an efficient way in the eyes of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of many gods, so too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, someone started to walk out of the crowd and headed to the area delineated by Richard, who would follow their way to the belief in the Highland God of War, the rest Most of them, there will definitely be mixed with other crazy believers, but I don’t know much. However, Richard is from Noland. A war of gods has been going on for countless years, and it has been fighting with other plane gods for countless years. The main plane, where the knowledge of fighting the gods has become a perfect system, is systematically passed down among the majority of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha waved his hand and a team of knights ran out, escorting the rows of priests to the crowd, one by one, the tall knights ran around the crowd, constantly high Calling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest of the people, along with the pastors to recite prayers, who refuse to read, are regarded as mad believers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests recited the mysterious prayers. Under the threat of the knights and guns, some people began to follow the chanting, and the number of people was increasing. Slowly, the energy that could not be seen by the naked eye began to rise and gradually filled the crowd. The sharp eyes of the knights swept through the crowd over and over again, and constantly grabbed the mad believers who refused to recite the prayers. At this moment, a young woman suddenly screamed in pain, fell to the ground, desperately The ground was rolling, and after a while, it was actually spurted out of her seven scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around her are in a state of utter disappointment, and they all retreat. People naturally know what it means. This is a punishment for God. What she did, she will recruit to the god of war in the highlands. God's punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People remembered that she had just recited prayers just like everyone else, but just casually followed, how suddenly she was recruited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to read, no one can stop." The sound of the knights like a thunder is constantly echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people continued to swear and screamed, and they suddenly discovered that this prayer was not as simple as imagined, in the crowd, an elderly old man again Falling on the ground, the body burned with fire, followed by a strong man, and in this way, one by one, the mad believers fell, they all incured the anger of the high gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not pay attention to those painful mad believers, but looked up at the sky, his eyes have passed through the sky, falling in the gods of the void, Shouted: "You also like to call yourself a god, in addition to punishing your own believers, what else can you do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Richard is like a thunderous spread Not only did the people in the square hear clearly, but also echoed in the godland of the highland God of War. At this time, the voices of the whispers in the country always sounded, but the contents were all cursing and reprimanding the gods of highland. This is the content of the prayer, but under the influence of the pastor, if the fanatics recite the prayers, their voices will be heard by the God they believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland God of War is not a tolerant god, it is constantly insulted by hundreds of voices, and the temperament of God is unbearable, let alone militant The Highland God of War, so he would rather lose his power and also lower the punishment, burn those who are mad believers to show their divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony is that the deities of the gods can only fall on those who are mad believers, as the false believer Theodore said, the belief is a noose One is tied to the believer's neck and the other is held in the hands of the gods. The deeper the faith, the tighter the noose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Richard has understood that Theodore is a very extreme false believer and leader. His theory and methods are very useful, even if they are a genre, but sometimes they are biased. He designed this. The set of prayer rituals is very effective, using God's hand to identify the mad believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony is still going on, from time to time, some people are burning, and there are also mad believers who go to the designated area on their own, and some people rush to the knights and pastors, and want to go with them. They immediately fell under the sword of the Knights who were armed to the teeth. Such a huge power gap, even if they burned all their fighting spirit and soul, did not leave any damage to any Cavaliers. Finally, the ceremony came to an end. Richard made people take those mad believers away and said to the rest of the people: "Congratulations, from now on, you are The civilians of the Crimson Principality, and soon, you will know what this identity will bring to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard becomes magical Abnormally bright and clear, but people still leave the letter suspiciously, until they go to their homes, still do not see the deadly sword or magic attack, which puts down the heart, hurried back home, and then lost their loved ones The family began to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard transformed the temple of the God of War into the altar of the Eternal and Time Dragon, and held a sacrifice ceremony here. The sacrifices were those sacrifices that Richard brought back from the battlefields of the extermination. The sands still used the book of time as an altar and presided over the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice was carried out in a low-key and rapid manner. For the first time, Richard chose the top sacrifice to make a sacrifice, and the result came out to make Richard feel helpless. The choice, Richard first gave up the time-like grace, but chose the special equipment class of grace, in fact, Richard now does not lack equipment, the only thing missing is the level of equipment, the reason for making this choice It is because this special equipment is rare and says that there is a description: "Choose me means extra gift to the host."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I saw this explanation, Richard was speechless. I don’t know why, but there was a slight increase in anger. This is indeed an option that he urgently needed recently. However, he did not expect it to appear in this way, and it was so obvious. A large number of strong people are quite vocal about the Eternal and Time Dragon. Now Richard finally understands that the secrets that he has hidden are likely to be snooped and used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No strong person would like this kind of manipulated feeling, and Richard does not like it, even though he will definitely choose this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichaqiang suppressed his unhappiness and reached out to touch the ball of light that represented special equipment, resulting in a broken piece of bone falling from the broken ball of light. Richard is in his hand, and the remaining time force transmits the use of this piece of bone to Richard’s mind. This piece of bone can be used to repair most weapons and it is possible to upgrade the level of the weapon, but it is best. The use was still on a weapon made of animal bones, which made Richard immediately think of his own barbaric slaughter. Now most of the time he uses the knife as a short sword, and Richard takes it out. Savage slaughter, try to put the bone on the knife, the bone piece melted, and then immersed in the barbaric slaughter, this savage knife gave a low roar, trembled a few times, the blade became more slender and slender, The short knife has become longer, almost no more than a long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the change, the whole knife reveals the dark gray of the sky, and the breath is deeper. It reveals the smell of rust, and Richard looks at it and finds it. This knife has added two attributes, sharp and armor. If it is against the barbarian, then these two attributes will become powerful sharp and powerful armor. After adding two attributes, the barbaric slaughter has been promoted. Legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the legendary legend to the legend, but consumed a top sacrifice, which makes Richard can not help but frown, now he can only expect this god to be as Explain that it is possible to allocate additional divine grace to the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the flowing sand outside the light curtain of the altar suddenly shook a little, revealing the color of the accident, she did feel that a lot of grace is flowing to herself, far beyond Normally presided over the ceremony of the top ceremonies, and another part of the grace of the continuation of the book of time, constantly strengthening this mysterious artifact, but left to Richard's own grace to reluctantly a high-level sacrifice, this is the top offering The sacrifice, the sand has not interfered with the content of the sacrifice, how can it become like this, but before the end of the sacrifice ceremony, it is not to be disturbed, and Li is in the same time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice continues, and Mr. Li Linlin has sacrificed nearly a hundred sacrifices. The total value is about the same as the top two sacrifices, but that It refers to the price of the sacrifice. In fact, the total amount of God's grace is much higher than that of the two top sacrifices. However, the number of sacrifices is high and the rank is low. The final result is that there is no truly useful and sacred gift. There is no blood pulse ability, no strong skills, no powerful fifth-order construction design, and no heavenly guards. Richard has been living for several years, a pile of piecemeal materials, and a quasi-legendary weight. Hammer, this two-handed hammer is unusually large, the hammer handle is up to three meters long, and the hammer head has a few tons of weight. At the moment of slamming, it can also release a very strong impact, so heavy hammer, Richard That is, Tiramisu can get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
