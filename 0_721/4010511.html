			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mza’s strength is much less than bloody, bloody after all It is a player selected by the Presbyterian Church. The characteristic is that the attack is extremely heavy and difficult. The Presbyterian’s plan is to let the bloody use Richard’s weak state to kill the opponent at the beginning of the battle, so that Richard will not speak on the battlefield. What Richard said was not always good afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is indeed a spike, but it is Richard’s second killing of blood, which makes everyone shocked, but Mza’s strength is inferior to bloody, but Richard Obviously it is not the state at the time of the first battle. In contrast, Richard’s losing face is even bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mzati carried a heavy axe gun, this heavy weapon is powerful, but not flexible enough, the general strong is rarely used, dare to use I don't like brute force, it is the real master. Mzza stared at Richard and shouted: "You are a Nolan, and here is the holy temple of Calando, let me send it here." You are on the road, sacrifice your beast with your blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already a little stunned at the moment, not listening to what Qingmza is saying, just watching The opponent, said to himself: "It is another one who wants to drill the mountain and the sea camp..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mza heard a big laugh and said: "Can be The Son of God is the father of the world, that is the dream of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With you... also with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single sentence provoked Mza's fierceness, and he snarled suddenly, rushing to Richard if a giant bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His axe swayed on layers of cymbals, this is the fluctuation of power, no need to directly hit the opponent, as long as it is within the scope of 涟漪It will not be lightly impacted, but on the five fingers of Richard, the magical light will be continually beating, one by one or assisting himself, or smashing toward the opponent, while the electro-optical light is on the same body, which has already driven the magical armed forces and began to walk around. Struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the elders sat down on the side of the stands to find an inconspicuous place to sit down and look at the showdown with no expression, the confidant elders also make up Come over, sit down next to the elders, and then say in a slightly incomprehensible voice: "The elders, this battle is still to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, since it has already started, then continue to fight." The elders said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...How is this state of Richard...how could it win?" When the elders watched the battle in the field, they felt that one hundred of them were Lose, and Mza has already released words, and Richard loses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders said slowly: "That's not necessarily, keep watching, although Richard's chances are not big, but there is still a chance, if he can Seize the opportunity to win this battle, then in the next ceremonial battle we will give him a chance, a fair battle, and the opportunity to win rewards. If this battle wins, you can also learn from the South. The elders of Calando, who have been busy making money recently, have not respected the Snow Mountain Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders don’t know what to say, they have to concentrate on watching The battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is really different from the previous one. Richard can no longer sway the unpredictable knife, and there is no way for people to track In his body, his strength in all aspects has dropped dramatically. It seems that the knife has drained his energy. Now Richard can only rely on dazzling magic skills and fighting with Mza, and he can only do it when he is not allowed to do so. Avoiding the opponent's attack, after blessing a lot of magic, and constantly harassing and weakening the opponent with small magic, Richard's speed is only equal to Mza, the power is even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mza has the hunter's instinct, and soon after the war, he sharply captured Richard's movements and stabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the gun is about to hit, Mza knows that Richard will be dodging, so he wides his eyes and keeps a close eye on Richard’s movements, but here At that time, he suddenly flashed a glare in front of his eyes, and then his eyes tingled. It turned out that Richard had a very small lightning bolt that was shot at Mza's eyes. Although Mza had a temperament protection all over the body, he was not afraid of such a small size. Lightning, but this lightning is still glaring, and it irritates his eyes, his eyes are involuntarily biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mzza yelled in his heart, and sure enough, the axe was empty, and Richard had escaped when he was blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of magic constantly flow from the hands of Richard, the usage is mostly ridiculous, except for the lightning that is as small as a toothpick, but also falls on the body only A small flame that will sting a little, a reluctance to make his footsteps slow, and a bluffing super huge hollow ice cone, etc., are all ridiculous things, sometimes even weaker than the magic apprentice's zero-level trick. Some, but Richard is taking advantage of Mzaza’s little influence. Every time he escaped from his gun, even one time, Richard suddenly did not hide or scream, holding a knife and standing, his eyes staring at Mza, and the infinite killings rose to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mza suddenly thought that Richard had to send out a knife that the ghost god couldn't stop. He took the gun back and stunned and prepared to pick up the move. He knew that Mza had retreated, and Richard also stepped back and ran away. Mza knew this. When he was deceived, Li Mingming couldn’t escape. Only then did he get scared. Actually, he really frightened him. Mza was only angry with blood, roaring like a thunder, and strode to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the last battle is fierce, then this is a bit funny, Richard is extremely flexible, and unexpected means emerge in an endless stream. He is obviously weak. However, Mza is not able to beat him. Soon after the two started the battle, the side of the field began to have laughter. The young soldiers pointed at the scene and kept commenting on how exciting it was. The attack was so stupid, and so on, and in their words, Mza was getting more and more unkind, and Mza was so angry that he was going crazy, but he was attacking in any case, it was a little bit of luck. How can I not hit Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is now, the only magic that Richard has released is that a cloud of more than ten meters is condensed over the duel field. There was a thunder of lightning, but there was never seen lightning falling down. It was obvious to what extent the magic power was lost. Even such a simple magic was so reluctant. After a few minutes, the first lightning was dropped in the dark clouds, but However, it is fine, not to mention the barbaric warriors who deal with the powerful, even the bigger World of Warcraft is not dead, this lightning fell, the scene suddenly sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mza was stagnated by lightning, and by this opportunity, Richard escaped from his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a louder laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, let the confidant elders look stunned, could not help but say: "This, this Richard, what is this, he can never The mistake was not made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders turned to look at him and said, "Look at Richard's eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders looked at it, and suddenly they were shocked. The atmosphere was different from the sneer at the side of the field. Richard’s eyes were incomparably clear and cold, and he was concentrating on observing every small movement sign of Mza. Then, in an instant, the reaction is judged. Regardless of the magic or the dodge, Richard is the same focus, and nothing can affect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder is more and more scared, but then he thinks of something, frowning and saying: "Even if Richard never makes a mistake, how can he win?" Is it possible to expect Mza to be exhausted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder sighed softly and looked at the field, slowly saying: "With your strength, how can you not even see this point, your heart is already chaotic, even if Richard is dead, It’s no big deal, but it’s just that the beast is coveting a bloody battle. I’m in front of you, you don’t have to worry about it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder is stunned and then repeatedly Yes, he has always been worried about the threat of Philip, and he is not very comfortable with everything that happened in the ceremonial war, so the heart is indeed chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t expect that the elders suddenly sighed and said: “Even without the armed forces of heaven, it’s no big deal to think about it.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders are once again stunned, but this time they don’t know what to say. The elders only said this, they stopped talking. The elder had to continue watching Richard and Mum. Struggle in the battle, looking for something that has not been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like like Richard, he dances with the blade. It’s still a few minutes, but ten minutes, twenty minutes, or even an hour, he still Still focused, there is still no wrong judgment, which is extremely scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the six emperors who watched the battle in the distance showed a smile and said to the Chinese: "You are right, this Richard... If I have the same strength as him If that, then I am definitely not his opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of China is uncharacteristic at this time, saying: "But your strength is above him, far from him. Above, so don't worry about this kind of thing, his way is here, whether it is losing or not, you don't have to think about him at this time tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Six Emperors said: "This is really a good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter outside the stadium has been sparse, and there is only a little excess The young warriors are still smiling tirelessly. The real strong people are more and more serious. Obviously, they have the same judgment as the six emperors. In this way, Richard shows the powerful on the other hand. power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still lightning falling in the sky, and now the bombardment of lightning has made Mzahave a clear reaction, sometimes not paying attention, the protective vindictiveness is not enough. Mza even showed painful expressions, and sometimes it hurts a few times. These lightnings still linger on the barbaric warriors. However, the elders who watched the battle suddenly looked up and stared at the thunderclouds in the sky. Don't turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
