			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole part of the summoning circle, her layout is almost perfect, only Secondly, the part that Richard personally laid. Richard, who has wisdom and real talent, has inhuman ability in the field of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the summoning of the squad was completed, Qi Qi silently packed up the tools and walked alone into the city. Nyris, Agamemnon and Richard stood together and watched the figure of Qi Qi disappear at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect this big beauty to have such a side, it's not easy!" Niris praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon rarely accompanies: "Really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Richard I don't admit that Qi Qi's focus and seriousness are really rare. This kind of concentration has been difficult to explain with personality, but must have other powerful forces. Just like driving Mad Richard to study and practice madly in the dark blue for five years, it is the picture of Elani disappearing in the fire. And Luo Qi's quiet face hides another powerful spiritual power, perhaps fanaticism, perhaps faith, perhaps something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Richard!" Nyris suddenly hooked Richard's neck, tightened hard, and the slim arm became as hard as steel. Said to him evilly: "You listen, I think from now on, I have officially become friends with Qi Qi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s mad, it’s not good, it’s funny and funny. This is not the first time he has become a friend with Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Neris’s arm was loose, but the next sentence made him laugh: “Li Cha, Qi Qi is not simple, but now it’s a Good woman. So, don't give her the opportunity to betray you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha carefully tastes the words of Nyris, and his heart is growing. The way to truly love a person, as Nyris said, is not to test, nor to give her the opportunity to betray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took three days, and the undead summoned magic array built by the power of many magicians was finally built, and in order to maintain the operation of the summoning circle, every day It takes 50 magic crystals. Such a huge summons that consumes so much, makes everyone full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fourth day began, Sandro began to launch the summoning circle. In other planes, this summoning ritual needs to be done at night, while the green sensation without the sun in the sky does not have to be restricted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a magical crystal being lit, a magical lightball is condensed above the summoning circle, and a pale mist is gradually formed in the circle. The undead atmosphere of the silky chills is gradually spreading. After a while, the first undead creature came out of the summoning circle, and it was a lich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich only reveals the fierceness of the moment, and is immediately controlled by the power of the summoned squad, surrendering to the level of the caster who is still lower than his own. The lich drifted away from the summoning circle and began to summon a low-order undead creature, then drove them to the depths of the forest. In the summoning circle, a bone horse stepped out and a burly death knight sat on the horse. After the death knight lifted a thick sword full of rust and greeted him, he instigated the bone horse and headed toward Shandui's fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another undead creatures emerged from the summoning circle, surrendered to the will of Sandru, and then proceeded toward the depths of the forest. An hour later, there were six undead creatures summoned by Sandru, and there were more than 20 undead in the tenth to fifteenth classes. There were hundreds of low-level undeads below the tenth level. Most of them were in groups. of. The Summoning Faction is still in operation. Sander’s spiritual power is very large. It seems that he has not reached the limit of burden, and the undead still go out from the summoning circle one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Shandru, who is only thirteenth, everyone is speechless. Even Richard is the first to see that Sandru uses such a large-scale undead call. Those who saw this scene will understand why the Necromancer will be hated by everyone before the advent of the plane war era. If you give the Necromancer enough time, then no other profession at the same level can compete with the Necromancer. Like the current Sandro, with so many summoning undead, it is not a problem for one person to deal with an entire adventure team below fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the summoning circle, as the undead gradually deepens into the forest, the magical light gradually expands and can be seen as a smoky forest image. That is the scope of the undead search, and the places they explored will appear in the magical images on the summoning circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru sat in the summoning circle, patiently manipulating the squad, directing the emerging undead creatures to explore the dead end. He put water and vitality medicine on his side, and there are many foods to eat. Obviously, he is ready to fight for a long time. The forest will appear within a hundred kilometers of the city, and according to the plane of the first tree of life, the other two trees of life are likely to be more than two hundred kilometers away from the city. Undead operations are not fast, and the slowest warriors are less than five kilometers per hour in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want to wait until there is a result, I am afraid it will take two days or even longer. Richard adjusted a team of elite warriors to protect Sandru, and he returned to the city and continued his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark forest, a chilly and humid wind blew through. The quiet forest is now dead, and all kinds of small animals that are infested hide back into their nests. A terrible breath that never appeared before shook it, only curled up in the deepest part of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These undead walked among the forests, and the wildfires in their eyes seemed so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has come, and the green scales are floating in the forest and continue to move forward. The undead are tireless, and they can go on until the fire of the soul burns out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the forest, two pairs of eyes are watching a walking beggar in the distance. Immediately, the faint voice rang, and a few meters had not yet been transmitted. It was blown away by the wind in the forest and would not be captured by the cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder, what is that? I feel incredible evil from it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Another slightly old voice said: "It should be a dead spirit! It is the most evil thing that has never appeared in our forest before. It must have been summoned by those invaders. Damn, great forest. The will cannot deal with these undead that have lost souls!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lush crown of the tree, a huge long bow is drawn, entwined with natural breath The long arrow aimed at the cockroach. This is a young and strong shooter with a strong light in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder, although it is evil, it is not strong enough, I can completely eliminate it with one arrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An old and dry hand held the bow of the young shooter, the elder then said: "No, don't be so anxious, patience is a virtue. We need to continue to observe and see what they want to do. The undead is not moving fast, and we have plenty of time to prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Druid has an old but wise face, he stares into the distance The embarrassment of walking, slowly said: "If we can find their true purpose, then we may be able to lay a trap for this, give these invaders a profound and unforgettable lesson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
