			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Licha is standing in the library of Theo. A book looks at the collection of the great jīng spirit king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Richard quite speechless is that more than half of the legendary big jīng Lingwang collection is related to art, from literature, poetry, painting, Until the sculpture, everything is included, and the Theo. Yang is itself quite successful in many aspects. His paintings and sculptures are mastered. Several peaks are taken to Noland to fully auction the price. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Richard, the sword of the great jīng spirit is really bad. Although he is a 23-level swordsman, he also has a strong The legendary skills, but the swordsmanship is very flashy, and lacks the concise style that only existed after the war. Obviously, there has not been much actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee can even say that his legendary powerhouse can win the Olympics, such as Tiramisu, mountains and sea. Such as water, even the possibility of killing opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the art in the library and private showrooms of Theo. Yang, Richard realized that the great king spent all his time Where to go, if he is willing to take half the time to practice the sword, the result will not be different when facing Richard, but at least it will not be slaughtered so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawks wandered around the palace of the great king, this is a very rare opportunity, if not followed by Richard, he has a chance to explore A palace of the great king, every detail here is very attractive to the goshawks who are eager for knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goshawk is not there, Mina sticks to Richard, and does not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the feelings of Richard, Mina raised a copy of her hand and said: "His Royal Highness, this is normal, this Theo is a man of more than eight hundred years old. In his current position, there is no pursuit at all. Art is the best thing to pass the time, not only him, I heard that the whole jīng spirit empire on the green continent. This is true of the upper layers, but in fact, in the later stages of the spirit of the spirit, the pursuit of art is also a tradition, almost every strong will spend a lot of time on art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You know a lot, but this is why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his own success caused Richard’s interest, Mina smiled and said: "Higher Jīng spirit is different from human beings. They are born with strong blood and long life. Ordinary high-class jīng spirits will have a life span of four or five hundred years old. As long as they are above the legend, their lives will surpass more than a thousand years. Such a long life has no Sufficient challenges naturally require something to pass the time, so almost every higher spirit loves art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be not enough challenges? Richard is really curious. In his life, almost from the dark blue, he is fighting all the time. When one plane finishes playing, he goes to another fight. The battlefield is not enough. The war with Dakso Das is even Continuing into the abyss, in short, the rise of Richard's history is entirely a history of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jīng spirit empire established by the higher jīng spirit almost ruled the entire Noland in the heyday, how could there be no challenge, just to maintain the battlefield and open up the battlefield The plane is enough for them to be busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina smiled and said: "The high spirits are totally different from our human beings. They are born with strong life and long life. Human beings are much lower, they are not very eager to open up new planes, and we humans are different. We instinctively want to put everything we see into our own pockets."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and nodded: "It is true, but in this way, the strength of the Qing Empire's jīng spirit empire may be even worse than I expected."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mina’s eyes turned and said, “Is this not a good thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing the high-level jīng spirit in the Cangqing mainland, Richard will not be surprised to see the large number of crafts in the private library of Theo. In the private warehouse of a big jīng spirit king, Richard found the main material that can make five pieces of fifth-order structure. From the richness of the collection, the jīn of the green continent The g spirits really have to go far beyond the legend of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard did not move the private possession of Theo Yang, nor did he move other possessions, but only took away the strange collection of poems, that is In the poetry collection of Yongge, Richard actually read the power of the rules from it, and also under the guidance of the power of the Farah, he browsed the world of the dream of the poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is very interested in this collection of poems. As long as he has time, he can extract the eternal spirit of the eternal song in this poetry level and create a new one based on the scale of the eternal song. Fifth-order construction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Li told the dark night that the spirits took a box of leaves of the world tree, and then led the army to continue to the heart of the jīng spirit empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under what Richard had expected, a quiet forest would have encountered several crusades composed of several tribes, but this 30,000 people Although the spiritual troops are considered to be large in the eyes of the higher spirits, if they are in the eyes of Nolan, it is not the case. Although Richard’s dark night jīng spirit is only 5,000, it is the lowest of 5,000. It is also a 16th-level dark night jīng spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, this high-ranking jīng spirit failed to attack the army. After the attack on Richard’s death, the jīng spirits dropped thousands. With the body, he had to retreat, and Richard continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, almost did not bring any damage to Richard, but the strength of the nearby high-class jīng Ling tribe was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard ushered in a real opponent, the super strong man of the spirit empire, St. Jīng Ling Wang Kathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When St. Cassie walked from the sky, Richard, who was quiet all the way, suddenly raised his head and said, "This is my opponent." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know that your opponent is a super strong, then no matter whether the goshawk or the splash will not compete with Li, how can you play with the high spirits? Lack of practical experience, the strength of the super strong is always there, the goshawk and the splash are all fierce, but if the two are on the same, it is possible to give the big jīng a king an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also vacated, standing in front of St. Cassie, blocking his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Cassie glanced up and looked at Richard and said, "I am St. Jīng, the king of Cassie, and come to see what qualifications you have. Jīng Ling Wang Ting asked to exchange things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Cassie's figure is tall, the body more than two meters is extremely well-balanced, his waist hanging With a pair of swords, the long hair of the golden sè is braided into a long braid and dragged behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard called out the relevant information of St. Cassie and said: "St. Cassie, the night language jīng spirit origin, was originally a killer, and later turned into Juggernaut, but still good at using double weapons to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Cassie’s eyes are different, and he said coldly: "You are really very careful, but this will not stop your failure."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happens if I lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Cassie said: "Speak what you want to exchange, Leave the twigs of the golden world tree, and then I will send someone to send them back to Noland, but all humans who set foot on the green continent will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "It’s better than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, St. Casey slowly pulled out the double sword, the momentum Quietly distributed, covering the range within a kilometer, the spirit of this holy jīng spirit is silent, except for the goshawk water, other people have no feeling at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina looked at the two people in the air and couldn’t help but whispered to the Goshawk: "Is that guy very powerful? I didn't feel his momentum." Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk did not answer, but reached out and pointed his finger at the distance. In the direction of his finger, a leaf was slowly falling, just in the meter. When Na's gaze caught the moment of this leaf, it suddenly split into two, and the incision was very smooth and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina suddenly grew cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation in the air ended with the attack of St. Cassie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Jīng Lingwang is just a simple spur, but the speed is incredibly fast, if it is changed to the ordinary legendary strong, only this record depends on the ultimate speed to win The spurs are beyond the speed of their instinctive reaction, unless they are pre-arranged passive protection, otherwise it is very likely that St. Casey will kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a soft bang, St. Cassi’s double sword was actually held by Richard’s cross-knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked relaxed and freehand, but the Santa Claus face that has been indifferent has suddenly changed, and he shouted: "The holy moonlight, how is this knife?" Will be in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
