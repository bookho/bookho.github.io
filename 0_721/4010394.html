			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two warriors like the goalkeeper, they have not arrived from the day of Richard When you are in the capital, you are still guarding the door. Now you are still guarding the door. In the future, you will continue to guard the door. The real field battlefield has no room for them to participate. It is also in the low-level existence in the days of the sun. Compared with Noland. Here is a more cruel and realistic place, but also a more hierarchical, real strong as white night, if you can not see the bottom of the sanctuary, you can even kill directly, as long as you give a reason to say afterwards, even compensation Can be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their relationship with Richard is quite good now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, these sanctuaries, which are not the strong, are the most common and lowest-level people. They have shortcomings, helplessness, and flashes. Richard now believes that people are not perfect, so he is willing to become friends with imperfect people, forgive their helplessness, appreciate their brilliance, and slowly, Richard’s friends are more and more. It has spread throughout the day, and there are even strong people who have come from other fortresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still drinks, and every time he returns, he will drink it once or twice, and those who are willing to drink with Richard are becoming more and more More, a street in front of his room has been drawn out, and an independent small square has been built with tables and chairs and huge umbrellas turned into a small open-air bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter of the stone platform at his door was originally unremarkable, but now he is loaded with a delicate railing, and there are several big magisters. Several vines were planted under the stone platform. In the environment of the extant battlefield, any fragile life could not survive. These vines survived by the magical infusion of several great magisters, so they survived. Now in the capital of the day, Richard’s residence is a rare place with green embellishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard appeared and started drinking, this small square was like entering a holiday, burning a happy atmosphere everywhere, but every time, in the square The people who drink alcohol are divided into two batches, and the ones that are small are distinct, and the ones with a small number are really strong ones. Among them, there are many heavenly sanctuaries, while the other side is like a city gate guard. People, their number is naturally far more than those who are strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, those who are really strong will not be able to afford these ordinary people, nor will they be willing to mix with them. It’s quite a bit of a sneak peek at the entrance of Richard, but since Richard has said that anyone can come here to have a drink with him, those strong people naturally won’t start to catch people, because it will only make Richard feel unhappy, no one. The strong willing to offend a builder at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real strong is the mainstay on the battlefield, the key to resisting the Dax Sodas, and the ordinary sanctuaries are not completely useless. They are still working, fighting, but playing far. Not as strong as the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard is equal to both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the two sides is different when drinking with Richard. The strong people are very respectful to Richard and even have some flattering taste. They all hope Richard can give priority to his own construction needs, even if he does not know what to say, but he hopes to leave a good impression on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ordinary people who disregarded the strong, but they all talked and laughed with Richard, joking without any scruples, and even some fierce If he wants to pour the wine of Licha, Richard will not be polite with them, he will be gambling, and if he loses, he will drink it. If he wins, he will press the brawny and take the bottle directly to their mouth. inverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Richard has been drinking with these ordinary people for a longer period of time, and only those who do not want to ask for him in the construction, It will be so open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or this is just no desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have been drinking for a long time, everyone has seven or eight points of wine, and Richard swayed and waved goodbye to everyone, and got into his room. The snoring sounded, and the strong people looked at each other. Some people stood up and left, and some people showed a sly look. They all knew that if Richard was so drunk and asleep, it would be impossible to remember. Who are they, what they said, no impression, how to give Richard a priority of one or two for the structure they need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong people are leaving one by one, the ordinary sanctuaries are still in the same place, and they have been in trouble for a while before they are scattered all over the place, many Ordinary look at the backs of those who are strong, spit out the mouthfuls of water, they can know the unrecognized ability of Richard, any slight movements falling into the eyes of Richard, will be remembered by him, even if Richard does not remember It doesn't matter if you live. They have already remembered these people. Afterwards, they will tell Richard that these ordinary sanctuaries have regarded Richard as a true friend. They don't want those who have a clear purpose for Richard and are resentful. The guys got the help of Richard. Although these ordinary sanctuaries are not strong, but the savvy of being a human being is better than the strong ones, they certainly know the dark mentality represented by these strong expressions. So I don't want them to be strong anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard put everything he saw aside and was sleeping asleep. All his consciousness was immersed in the depths of his blood. The magical world tree that just broke through was almost occupying the entire space of consciousness, than the rest. The four world trees are almost twice as high, and the Archimonde blood is expanding to form the heaven and earth of the consciousness space. The sky is the bloody fire net, the ground is the flowing magma, and the Akmende after the expansion. The blood is still able to wrap the magical world tree, but the blue leaves and the roots of the top of the magic tree are obsessively explored by the blood of Akmon, waving in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acmemond and the magical world tree faintly constitute the opposite, although the Archimonde blood is still dominant, but it can no longer suppress the magic star The power of the world tree, the magical world tree, can be seen from the real name of Richard, but the power of Desmassen is obviously above the Salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is screaming, his chest is soaked with a large stain, and the thick beard is full of hops. He is lying on the bed, even the boots. Do not take off, feet directly on the bed, not waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long I have slept, a crisp magic ringing sounds in the room, Richard’s ear moves, the snoring sounds, but the magic bell keeps ringing Finally, Richard made a long sigh of relief, and then stretched out a big lazy waist, slowly opened his eyes, in a box in the corner, a delicate magic clock is constantly jumping, making joy The tweet, the magic clock has long been covered with a thick layer of dust, I don’t know how long it will take until the scheduled time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the magic bell, there was a somewhat lonely smile on the corner of Richard’s mouth. This magic clock set the time when he came and threw it in In the corner, when the magic bell rings, it means that one year has passed, and it is time to go back and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year of the dusk land is about the equivalent of Faro’s one year and one season, and Noland will spend more than forty days. For a long time, in front of Richard’s eyes, a familiar face, flowing sand, water flower, Gangde, Tiramisu, Agamemnon, Nyris, Oral, Twilight, etc. Suddenly, they have been separated from them for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the strong is destined to be lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, it’s time to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li Tengeng jumped out of bed, he rushed to the bathroom, removed his clothes, and hit a large basin of cold water. When he poured himself down, the ice-cold water suddenly made him wake up, and the spirit was also Excited, Li recalled a white gas, straightened his chest, went to the front of the mirror, but stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in the mirror is a man with long hair and a beard, with a slap in the rough, how can he still have a half-point in the past? Perhaps only the beautiful eyes with obvious elf characteristics, but also vaguely have a shadow of the past, seeing himself in the mirror, Richard stayed for a long time, only to recognize that this is indeed himself, if the style, it is and Gordon Something like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed, at least now, he knows how Gordon’s appearance came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whistled, grabbed the elf knife, and cut the hair with a knife that was more than a meter long, and scraped the beard, in the blink of an eye, mirror The Chinese have become a handsome and beautiful young man, but now Richard has already taken off his delicate temperament, but he has brought a smothering murderousness like a white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up and leaned in the mirror, looked at himself carefully, and took a long knife after a while, carrying a large one in the corner A small two boxed magic box, walked out of his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door, a middle-aged Sanctuary strong man is putting a letter on the stone platform at the entrance of Richard, he is full of faces Xi Xi and He, when they were in the letter, their hands were shaking. He might have encountered the bottleneck of strength. Perhaps he had enough money to buy a piece of construction. In short, Richard is now his greatest hope for improving his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard went out, the Sanctuary strongman inadvertently glanced at Richard, his eyes fell on his letter, he Feeling that the position of the letter was a little uncomfortable, I sorted it out and looked at it again. I couldn’t help but sort it out. When I saw this scene, Richard smiled and said nothing, just carrying the bag. Going, when Lawrence lived, he shouted to him: "The old man, I will go back for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the Lawrence Ducks : "Fast, don't waste my efforts, do more, and remember the list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One mentioned that fifty years ago The list, Richard's face immediately turned green, said: "List, I have forgotten." Then, before Lawrence chased out, he hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
