			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the hurriedly, Niris said: "Richard, Don't blame me for a lot of things. But if you are a builder, you have to make a name for it. It is best to hold a press conference often. If the conditions are ripe in the future, it is best to hold a regular press conference in Faust. However, You have to wait until you can make a fourth-order build to get the honor of holding a regular launch conference. Even Luno doesn't have this qualification now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard nodded and began to seriously think about what kind of construction design he could bring out for auction. His ideas on the design of the structure are often unconstrained, but can be closely integrated with the goal, so the design of the non-standard structure, even the first-order structure, is very distinctive. Inspired by Nyris, he has a deeper understanding of the market for the decoration. Although the parts are not enough to be used as the theme of the conference, it is enough to enrich the content of the conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Richard’s thoughts, Nolan’s officers rushed to inform them that the plane of the plane had stabilized and that the plane could now be transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the last lessons, Richard first sent a team of heavy armored infantry with a tower shield into the portal before scheduling followers and others. A batch of people enters the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Mori. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master Lina is leaning on the sofa, lazily looking out the window, occasionally touching a fruit from the silver pot in front of him, stuffed into his mouth. The fruit is crisp and delicious, but Lina bites her mouth but feels boring. The fruit that can be eaten here is such a kind, even if the taste is good, eating it every month, it will be annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the room is dim, like the sky outside the window. The water of the big group flew into the room from the window, and it became thick and thick, and it was uncomfortable to touch it. Lina felt that there was no place in her body that was dry and her underwear became sticky. The magic climate regulator is too expensive for the status quo of the plane, even if it is installed, there is not enough energy to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for the big magician, the harsh natural environment has not caused much trouble to the body, but it still affects the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and looked out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside the window is blue and gray, and there is nowhere to see where the clouds are. Only a group of cold and cold mists fall from the sky. Looking at the past, there is a group of green everywhere, only the difference between shading and darkness. It seems that this plane has no other colors, and even the haze of the sky is faintly grayish green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green is a symbol of vitality, but in this world of green everywhere, it is suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina moved a little, but she felt so damp, she even felt that she was already suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of her vision, the fog suddenly surged, and a long, sharp arrow pierced through the fog, aiming at her neck. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina lazily snapped a finger, and a hemispherical transparent shield appeared in front of the arrow. The feather arrow shot through the water-like shield, and the speed immediately slowed down by three points. A serpentine ring on the Lina index finger fired a bolt of lightning, hitting the feather arrow and breaking the magical power attached to the arrow. The feather arrow finally struggled to wobble into the window, but was gently picked by Lina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long arrow of nearly two meters. The whole body is made of turquoise wood, and the tail is dyed with light green feathers. The arrow is wrapped around a thin vine that is the magic source of the long arrow. The arrow is made of the teeth of a certain creature, and the tip of the tip is hollow, emitting a bitter almond flavor from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poison in this kind of arrow is very powerful, it can poison an elephant in a minute, even if Lina is poisoned, it will be very trouble. Just want to poison her, but also the magic arrow can shoot her. The arrow was shot from the 800 meters, and Lina was sitting in the magic tower at the moment, and it was impossible to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for energy conservation, the magic tower is not in a state of instant start, otherwise Lina will sit there without a finger, this arrow It is also impossible to walk through the window intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina just looked at it and threw the arrow into the corner. Such attacks come two or three times a day, even if they know that there is no effect at all, and they will not give up. The resilience of the indigenous people and the hatred of the invaders can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Lina would immediately try her best to chase the attackers, and she was killed by several Greenwood Elf archers. But then the indigenous archers learned to be smart. When they shot out, they no longer had the result, and they turned around and ran away. In the 茫茫 forest, hundreds of meters apart, Lina is also difficult to catch up with the indigenous archers who escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after a few days, Lina was too lazy to chase, just back to a super long range bursting fireball. The fireball without tracking is not enough to catch the archer, and it is inevitable that the attacker will use the super-magic effect, so the dragon master just wants to export bad luck. In a few days, she didn't even have the fireball to throw it, just simply picking the arrow off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous attacks have occurred all the time. Master Long has a way to deal with cold arrows, but does not mean that people in the city can deal with cold arrows. Now people have to wear a shield even when they go out, always be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city wall has largely lost its effect, because the forests that surround the city grow very fast, and the crowns are even higher than the walls. Lina has cleaned up many times with fire magic, but she can only exchange a few days of peace. In this damn environment, the effect of fire magic is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the indigenous skill of the bow and arrow can even let them shoot the arrow into the city in a parabolic form, and then start the natural magic attached to the arrow, let the arrow Automatically find and track living targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how to prevent it, there will still be people who die every day in the attack, one at a time, six or seven times. However, in this outpost city, there were only 10,000 people left after the change of ownership, rebellion, and rebellion. It includes two thousand less soldiers, thousands of civilians, some of whom are the families of the soldiers, and the other part of the various occupational populations required for the most basic operation of the city, which basically lasted from the period of Schumpeter rule. Finally, the captured indigenous slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month, the number of people killed by the attack is close to 100. For a city of this size, it is enough to cause panic. If Lina was shocked by absolute force, she might have escaped in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly don’t escape to the forest, because everyone knows that the indigenous people are extremely hostile to the outsiders, and the only thing that falls into their hands is the extremely painful death. The most hopeful thing for the people trapped in the lonely city is to escape to Noland through the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
