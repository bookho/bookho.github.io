The ogres lord couldn’t bear it. He even fell down directly next to the abyss lord, and then he couldn’t climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one laughs at Tiramisu, but instead casts envious eyes, like the ogre, a talented eating race, the more sensitive the perception It means that the talent is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu was not able to climb up by the great abyss of the abyss, and it is the proof of the blood of the powerful, the ogre will become a legend, and currently It seems that it will not stop at level 21. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bypassing the body of the demon lord, a group of followers also saw the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris was the most shocked and lost his voice: "His Royal Highness, this, this should not be"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is the transmission channel to the abyss," Richard said with a wry smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Zonghu suddenly heard the news: "Master, there is a temple here, I think you should come and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the battlefield, there is a shrine, although the temple is not large, but the whole body is made of black iron, the top of the temple casts a demon head, and represents a big lord. The badge is marked as a typical abyssal style. The reason for the small size may be that the number of demons in the temple is not enough or the power is insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went into the temple, the space inside the temple was not big, and the devil's words were engraved on the four walls. These words showed a dark red light, flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the legend, Richard has inexplicably added some exotic characters to the knowledge system. Devil is one of them, although the time is still short. It is enough to be proficient, and it is enough to see that the words on the walls and even on the top of the ground are a paragraph of spells that constitute a directed pool of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the temple there are two deep pools, which are soaked in two bodies. What is strange is that the pool is full of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard walked over to the pool and looked inside. His eyes narrowed and he said, "This is the Highland God of War and Sinai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers who are present mostly follow Li Inspected and participated in two wars of God, and recognized the look of the two gods. At this time, all kinds of things in the past gradually came together. Richard was thoughtful, and many secrets had an answer at the moment. At this moment, Richard suddenly felt a cold wind coming, and when he turned his head, he saw two translucent figures rushing to himself. Rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ghosts, how can Richard be afraid of this attack, but before he can do something, Achilles and Clark will each break off, Clarke showed a fist mark on the top of his head, and then a golden light column shot at a ghost, while on the other side, Asiris threw a deep black warhammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hammer of Judgment and Sanction, these two powerful deities deal with the monsters of the Ghosts. The two ghosts only have time to make a long tragedy. The scene disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard remembered why these two ghosts had a familiar feeling. It was not a ghost, but a sense of highland God of War and Sinai. It has now completely disappeared from this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pools of energy-rich energy, and the two bodies that have not yet fully condensed, are not the most valuable asset of this temple, really have The value is the circle that can transform the power of the plane into the power of the god. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Richard estimates that the pool of water plus two gods, about two hundred deities, this is not a small fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the side of the temple, a thick note is placed on the table. This is the diary left by the Highland God of War. When searching for the battlefield under the Ministry, Richard stayed alone in the temple and read the diary carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Highland God of War has actually fallen in the last campaign, but he closed the Kingdom of God, delayed the process of the breakdown of the Kingdom of God, and then resorted to a servant in the Kingdom of God. The power of God supports the avatars to go to the ancestral highlands to retrieve the wealth hidden here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland God of War has long been eyeing the potential of barbarians, and thousands of years ago, he destroyed the three great ancestors of the barbarians in the battle of God. He then disguised himself as an ancestor of the barbarian and stole the faith of the barbarian tribe in the ancestral highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the martyrdom of the high gods has not been satisfied. He greedily believes in the barbarians' beliefs and fears the powerful power of the barbarians, so he casts the most powerful curse on the barbaric ancestor's altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This curse goes deep into the blood of the barbarian, and spreads with generations with the proliferation. Under the curse, the power of the barbarian is limited to the tenth level and can never be broken. The trapped soul will pass the excess power back to the ancestral altar and be absorbed by the body buried under the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This god is the backhand of the Highland God of War for himself, just like the Lady of the Night, but the luck of the Highland God of War is much better than that of the Lady of the Night, he After the defeat of the gods, he successfully fled back to the original place and used the powerful body that took the power of the barbarians of thousands of years to regain the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the process of reigniting the fire, the Highland God of War inadvertently discovered the endless cloister of the underground, and found the way that Richard had just walked. Ancient battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Highland War God who has never been out of the face of the crystal wall is deeply shocked by the terrorist power of the demon lord, and thus has reached a deal with the devil will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland God of War represents the demon will, and the demon teaches him how to extract the power of the plane, and to resurrect the demon lord, when the devil is big After the resurrection of the Lord, its power to tear the plane is enough to conquer Faro in an instant, and at that time, the Highland God of War will become the king of the Faro gods. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Highland God of War commanded the only barbarian tribe in the valley that retained the potential for evolution, and built the abyss pool, which has been pumping for centuries. In the beginning, the initial land gradually became a dead place, and the scope continued to expand, finally becoming what Paul sees today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to Richard’s calculations, the function of the Abyssal Array is not exactly the same as that of the Highland War God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a few hundred years, the damage of the plane source will not be repaired, the initial place will collapse, and there will be a direct connection to the abyss. The plane of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon in the abyss will continue to flow into Faro, turning it into a place of melting and magma, if Faro can carry it, then Will gradually assimilate into another abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that Richard knows that the evolution of Faro, which is closed under the covenant of Gods, is not complete. It has no ability to carry the power of the entire abyss. Therefore, there is only one result. Faro will gradually disintegrate and become a demon evolution. Nourishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desperate Sinai also came to the initial place, and also received the gift of the devil's will at the expense of the vassal: heavier to the strength of the plane Cast the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard can't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Lords of Faro thought they could re-emerge with the power of the demon lord, but they did not know that the final transaction would be the entire Faro Destruction, and as a manifestation of the Faro plane rule, it is impossible to get rid of the destiny of destruction, trade with the devil, lose not only the soul, but also the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days were repeated searches of the battlefield. Richard and his followers almost turned the entire land over, but did not find it again. More valuable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Richard returned to the ground and then faced the heart of the same size as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the demon lord still retains vitality. If you put on the altar of eternal and time dragons, you will not be able to get a level of grace. Between the first and second levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that if Richard’s luck is enough, the eternal and time dragon willing to release water, he will see the deep blue sighs on the altar. There may be one or two core materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the devil, the heart is the essence of their body, the skull is only secondary, a powerful demon is beheaded, still able to survive, but if it is dug Out of the heart, it will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard is staring at the heart in a daze, not giving it to the altar of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is still pulsating, every pulsation will drive the blood of the whole body of the whole body, and the three hearts of Richard follow it with the same rhythm. Beating, Richard also tried to control the heartbeat, but as soon as he relaxed, the three hearts would return to the same rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a phenomenon that should not happen at all, but it is happening. This phenomenon, Richard has seen in several magic books, it is called blood resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard is almost certain that there is a section in the real name of this demon lord called Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown for thousands or tens of thousands of years ago, the demon lord opened the space passage to the ectopic plane with incredible terrorist power, but met The unknown giant worm and the giant beetle that did not know whether it was a genus or a descendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an earth-shattering war, the demon lord finally won the final victory, but its million-strong army was smouldering, and it soon fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of this battle is beyond description. From the incomplete spatial rules, Richard saw that the ancient battlefield predecessor was actually a complete plane, but The entire plane was destroyed by the earth-shattering battle. In the end, only a piece of debris of a few hundred kilometers was left, and somehow floated around Faro and connected with the Faro continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and looked at the devil's heart. The eyes were all complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the origin of the Norland Archimonde family is derived from the demon lord, the reason why Akmon’s blood is not included in the mainland The bloodline is because there is no big lord in Archimonde in the demon corresponding to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now Richard knows that Archimonde actually has a big lord, but it has fallen in the long past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, this heart is the ancestor of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling in Richard’s heart is getting more and more complicated. He is thinking about Gordon, the man who is said to have been brought to the bottom of the abyss by Modred. On the edge of the abyss, surrounded by sulfur and flames, he had an impulse in an instant, trying to go straight along the road ahead, and eventually he was calmed by reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unconsciously reaches out and wants to touch the heart of this great demon lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: The deposit box says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
