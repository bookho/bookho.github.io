He also saw that surrounded by Richard The knights turned their heads at the moment, and the look was like watching a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t see any orders issued by Richard, his troops suddenly moved, a series of dazzling interspersed transpositions, the original scattered snake array It turned out to be a miraculous change into a sharp assault formation of the storm, and at the forefront of the formation, it is a huge number of scabbards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Pitraton was stunned for a moment, watching the construction knights of Richard begin to accelerate, and then the entire formation moved, following the construction of the Knights rolling Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides rushed together and flew flesh and blood, and then the count saw his troops collapse at an unimagined speed. He realized that I have no determination but I have no strength to match my determination. And his determination is very limited. In fact, I hope to rely on the number of private troops and the Tucson family's badge to scare Richard. I don't really want to fight. A trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl did have the determination to fight the battle, but Richard was always ready to take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the news of the invasion of the private army of Pitraton was spread throughout the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl himself has retained his life, not even injured, but the private army has more than 5,000 prisoners, but the count is almost ruined, this is still a special investigation. The result of the ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, no one in the local aristocracy dared to provoke Richard, and the people on the list of Richards either abandoned the territory and fled, or else Taking the initiative to surrender, in anticipation of a little bit of preferential treatment, Richard has promised that as long as you give up resistance, the crime can be slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a traitor is caught, Richard will put the corresponding name on the list, and every betrayer will flee, and Richard will occupy their territory. Expelling their family to punish the betrayal, as the names on the list were crossed out, Richard’s reputation was soaring, and his reputation rose, how much the reputation of the Marquis of Sauron would fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always people who are unwilling to learn from the failures of their predecessors, and try to deter Richard by the background and a loud family name like Count Pitraton, but their tragedy is that their strength is far less than that of Piedmont, and Richard It is also a person who will give them war as long as the opponent yells at the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting an earl and three viscounts, no one dared to come out again and Richard 'theory', and the nobles recalled again. The name of Kemond's "madman", Richard used iron hooves and swords to make these people understand that it would cost ten times to get a piece of fat from the Akmon dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also branches that are unyielding and unyielding, and Richard does not have the slightest mercy, and all the main members of the branch family who are fully resisted will be executed, and the rest will be Become a slave, sell it to slave traders on the spot, and the territory is directly confiscated by Richard. As for whether it is reasonable, Richard will not take care of it. From the perspective of the alliance law, this is the patriarch’s handling of family conflicts. It is enough to be interfered by the aristocratic court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Richard has punished the insurgents within the family in accordance with the principle of disposing of the traitors, and also displayed his own blood in front of the nobles of Noland. Means, his small army of more than a thousand people is not large, but like the sickle in the hands of death, the death and destruction are spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the list of Richard’s only two last names, he suddenly encountered an unexpected enemy, Baron Suya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an accident, because the Baron of Suya has put on a decisive battle, but only brought two thousand people, and there is even a knight None of them, this number seems to be the private army owned by the Baron of Suya, and is a private army that the baron can normally possess. He did not move to the army of the Marquis of Sauron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suya, you want to fight." Richard looked at the opposite Baron of Suya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why not." Suya’s eyes braved the fire, and that was the real Arcmond flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at Suya, Richard looked even more surprised: "Just by the person behind you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much does that need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shen Shen, seriously said: "With the quality of your army, the number is to add a zero and can not win me, not to mention that you are not more than now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winning." Suya Baron suddenly smiled, the more laughter the louder, then roared and roared: "Do you not win, don't you fight?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Suya carefully, then agreed to nod and waved his hand, and the knight behind him immediately spread out like a flood, discharging a dense formation, apparently Richard was not prepared to defend. Once Suya attacked, he would use the absolute advantage of the knight to give Suya a head-on blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive knights gathered together, the pressure was suffocating, but Suya was not scared, but turned back to his own soldiers. Road: "Akmunds, let our enemies look at it, we also have the courage to fight the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya shouted, but it should Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of his warriors who have already shown the fear of shaking. In Noland, the established knight is the king of the battlefield. Once the monsters in the bare sanctuary charge, any ordinary warrior who is on their front will die, no luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn ending is the source of fear of the knight, and if you know that you are on the assault knight’s assault, it will be crushed into powder. But it can't stop the speed of the other party slightly, but the colleague next to it can survive, then the most brave warrior will hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the biggest headache for the commanders is which team should be placed on the frontal assault route of the knight, which is the location of the cannon fodder, no exceptions and no luck. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier’s cowering made Suya a little surprised, and then he was even more angry. He pulled the sword to the sky and issued the traditional warfare of Archimonde. The horse rushed to Richard, no matter how many fighters he followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the soldiers are grindly left in place, only a small number of fighters follow Suya to Richard, but half of them rush to the middle Can not stand the opposite of the knight's fierce momentum, quietly slowed down, and even some people directly sneak, and finally followed by Su Ya rushed to Richard, there are only one hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred ordinary warriors, don't say that they face ten times more super-elite troops. Their number does not even have a lot of detective knights. It can be said that this is a deadly charge, but from the leading Suya to the last More than a dozen infantrymen who ran with their feet, all red eyes, tearing open their throats and yelling at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was slightly surprised, and then could not help but move some movements, not because of the strength of the opponents, but because of their courage, from these personal strengths are not worth mentioning On the warrior, even the Baron of Suya, whom he has always despised, Richard saw the soul of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha raised his hand, so the followers and the knights all clenched their weapons, only when Richard’s hand fell, they would back Go and kill the opponent with absolute strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s representative of the killing did not fall, but received it and replaced it with a sentence: “All caught.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers and the knights are a bit surprised, but the live capture is much more difficult than the killing, but the strength difference between the two sides is too great, the knights are not I feel that there is something difficult, and it is also a little difficult for Suyal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suyatonghong’s eyes are already only Richard, and he doesn’t have to look around and how many people are behind him. He’s from the moment he started the charge, maybe even more Earlier, when the assembly army appeared here, it was ready to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only 20 meters away from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya kills the sound behind him, and the knights forcefully insert from the two wings, separating Suya from the soldiers, while Suya, who is charging, suddenly finds the side. The square shrouded a large shadow, and the whole sky seemed to be dimmed. He turned his head, but saw a huge body that was so large and unimaginable that he was wrapped in a bad wind and pressed his head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Suya felt that it was a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya only had time to struggle to stab the sword, and the epic-level sword actually made a large piece of Mars on the opponent's armor, and then barely broke the armor. However, the power has been exhausted, and then the mountain will put Suya underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tiramisu squatted from the ground, the whole person of Suya was pressed into the ground, if there was still a horse under him, I am afraid It will be crushed directly by Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
