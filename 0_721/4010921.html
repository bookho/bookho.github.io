Not only the dragon, but even the strong people on the human side are also looking at the thunder in the hands of the dark nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first night of the night and the Raytheon Rotary Firearms are in front of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jīng The spirits skillfully replaced the metal disk, and put Raytheon behind them, continued to join the ranks of the caster, and constantly cast a thorn on a distant dragon. Surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Druids seem to be only a low-level natural spell of Thorns. But in the hands of five hundred high-level Druids, no matter what low-level spells will become amazing. The dragons and the dragons were bound by the thorns and then killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human powers also saw the opportunity, they also waited for an attack on the bound dragon, so that Richard can stay to deal with the most powerful Head dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred high-end jīng Ling Druid’s influence on the battle even surpassed the construction of the knight, a metal dragon tried again to this huge Drew According to the square array, the impact was launched. The wind dragon is fast enough, but the strength of the dragon body is far less than that of the metal dragon. This dragon feels that he may be able to withstand the bombardment of Raytheon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dozens of jīng spirits were again aiming at Raytheon, the metal dragon rushed up the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring sound overwhelmed the audience again, and the metal dragon was bruised and bruised. It is again scared and excited. Excited is finally resisting this round of bombardment, but the fear is that the power of Raytheon is much larger than it imagined. If there are dozens more Raytheon, it will also step on the end of the wind dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as if in the midst of the command, a total of two hundred Druids turned their heads and their sights fell on the metal dragon. ! Between their hands, there is a flame that contains a natural breath beating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal dragon finally knows that these jīng spirits will not only use the thorns, but also use the six-level sun flame. Only the cost of this knowledge is really heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred high-level Druids set fires, not the ordinary dragons can resist. The burning flame of the sun burned the metal dragon into a coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also dragons that command thousands of dragons to attack from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turns out to be a stupid idea. Want to rely on people's tactics to deal with a total of 500 senior Druids? A piece of sun flame has become a sea, and instantly swallowed thousands of dragons rushing to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Druids is too much, to the point where everyone has never seen them. When so many casters are brought together, the quality of the war is completely different. They don't even need to rely on the Cavaliers to protect them. No matter who dares to rush, the magic is gone, and the world is clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some human powers look at the Druid square intricately, and they also think of a way, that is, using the legendary Master’s extensive range of magic to cover the bombardment, It is possible to erase these hundreds of Druids directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is only a theoretical possibility. In the sky, there is still a Richard standing. After demonstrating the terrorist power of the Medalon battle version, these human powers finally realized that Archimonde’s last short board on the top power has been Lee. Inspect yourself to make up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard, moving like a thunder, no tricks, a sword will kill, showing the power of the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Raytheon, the appearance of this strangely shaped weapon also makes the human powers feel fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Raytheon is not too big, and the full blow of the knight is even stronger than its even shè. But its terrible thing is that there is no requirement for the user, that is, no magic and no vindictiveness, as long as it can withstand its recoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of Thor's close-range fires can hit a dragon. If such weapons can be equipped on a large scale, then you can build an army that is even more terrible than a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the knight is limited by the number of builds and carriers, and the force can reach tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons suffered heavy losses, and they finally couldn’t support it and signaled a retreat. A head dragon flew to the portal and withdrew the dragon plane. Thousands of dragons who were too late to withdraw were apparently used as victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly pulled out a shadow in the air, seemingly slow, chasing the most powerful space after the dragon, reaching out to its dragon tail Pull it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space dragon feels dangerous, immediately launches a talent, and wants to use space to send away. However, at this time, Richard suddenly launched the title of space lord, impeding the transmission of space over the entire Dragon Valley! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space dragon only drilled half of the body into the void, and the originally blurred space suddenly became the essence again, it was like hitting the crystal wall. Suddenly stuck in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People watched a cobweb-like crack in the void. In the next moment, the space is completely transformed into essence, and the space dragon is forcibly ejected from the state of transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard is still stretching forward, grabbing the dragon tail of the space dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Richard suddenly became as heavy as a mountain, pulling the space dragon to the ground! Just listening to the loud noise, one person and one dragon squat on the earth, and the ground sinks deeply in the violent impact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space dragon screams, that is, it can not withstand such a violent and violent impact, the bones of the body are broken dozens of roots, squatting on the ground, how to struggle Can't climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard was half-squatting on the floor, sneer, and stood up, actually unharmed! The body under the armor is even more tyrannical than the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space dragon is still struggling, and Richard suddenly accelerates and fits into it! The huge dragon body of tens of meters was actually hit and flew up, throwing dozens of meters across the ground before falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of collision, the space dragon's ribs do not know how many roots are broken, and the power of the claws is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stepped forward to the space dragon, and his footsteps echoed in the ear of the dragon at this moment, like the whisper of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space dragon barely raised his head and glared at Richard, and opened his mouth, and wanted to spray a bite out. However, Richard suddenly disappeared in front of it, and the next moment appeared above it, stepping on the top of the space dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmatched tremendous strength, the dragon's horns of the space dragon are bent, and its faucet is deeply stepped into the ground until it is topless. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the space dragon is no longer struggling, it has passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Anbu walked down from the space dragon and walked to his own knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human powers are staring at Richard at the moment, always feeling that they have never really met him. Just now, Richard’s fighting style relied on the strength of the opponent’s opponent to directly crush the past. In a couple of times, he stunned a space dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has banned the transmission of the space dragon, although it is shocking, but still within acceptable limits. But his later battles completely overturned common sense. This is not a human battle, but more of a battle of the great abyss of the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, rude, direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons all fled back, and the dragons who were after the break rushed up and committed suicide attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results they can achieve are almost zero, and five hundred nights jīng Ling Deluyi releases half of the thorns and uses the thorns to bring all the dragons Tied in place, then the other half of the Druid's sun flames arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number of high-ranking mages became scale, the efficiency of their massacre overwhelmed all other professions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of dragons have not been able to persist for a minute under the raging fire, and they have fallen and become a coke. Looking at this scene like a flame of hell, several legendary strong faces are very ugly, looking at Richard's eyes also a lot of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard inserted the holy sword on the earth, and then the white light flashed, and the king of angels, Midalun, had already received it. There are a few legendary wizards who immediately realize that it is not armor, but a special form of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they have never seen such a shape. When it appeared, many people had the illusion that it was the real creature, and Richard was part of him. It is so perfect, so majestic, so powerful, far more than the so-called holy decoration! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does... These powerful people suddenly have an incredible thought in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this construction already beyond the fifth order? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer shocked them all, but if you think about it carefully, you might think that this is the real answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane portal finally quieted down and the dragons were withdrawn. In the Valley of the Dragon, a total of more than 20 dragons were left dead, and there were three or four dragons that could not be injured. The dragons have lost tens of thousands of bodies, mostly burnt to coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the five-small mask centered on the portal is still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes and pulled up the holy sword in the backhand. He strode to the plane to the portal and walked into the five-small mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flashed on his body, summoning Midranden, and then dragging the holy sword into the plane portal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face suddenly screamed: "Hey, wait! There is also the king of war..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard has stepped into the portal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is angry: "This guy, are you looking for death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation, The ripples that occurred when Richard left, have not dissipated, and they have radiant. Richard jumped out from the inside, and when he landed, he was awkward and almost squatted on the ground. He took Midalun, revealing a pale, paper-like face, and then squirting a blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
