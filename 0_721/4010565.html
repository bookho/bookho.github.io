			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant cockroaches have not moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hill made of monsters, suddenly the red light oozes out, and then the entire hill is undulating, and a circle of dark red fire appears. The waves, silently expanding to tens of meters away, disappeared. All the monsters, warriors, and mages that had passed through the dark red fire did not move. It was like the moment when the time was solidified, and the monsters that were not affected by the fire wave turned out to be a moment. They all froze, and they don’t know what the fear is. They are also trembled. It’s not fear, but the aversion of life instinct to destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still silent, a huge fireball with a diameter of 100 meters rises, the dark flames silently swell, and there are countless monsters floating in the body. Floating and sinking, all the monsters were destroyed by the naked eye, and were completely swallowed by the flames. The huge fireball continued to move upwards, eventually turning into a mushroom cloud, floating above the battlefield, under the mushroom cloud, and Richard stood on the ground. Zhou has no enemies. He has a dark flame all over his body. Even the moonlight on his back is also on fire. All the clothing and equipment of Richard have been destroyed. At this moment, it is already naked, but the burning flame is Like putting a layer of flame armor on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his eyes, a beautiful stream of eyes with molten fluid flowing in his eyes, his eyes slowly sweeping enemies dozens of meters away, sight Wherever they went, the monsters and the warriors involuntarily stepped back a few steps. Richard reached out and the moonlight fell on his hand. At the moment when the long knife started, the blade immediately ignited a glimmer of fire until the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight blade points to the ground, dragging a line of fire on the ground, and Richard drags a long knife like this, and walks toward the infinite enemy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A head like a rhinoceros, but the body of the war is bigger than the mammoth, the war beast took the lead, and bowed down to Richard, the thick bone on it. A defensive power comparable to the Knight's full plate armor, requires a ten-level warrior to hold a giant axe to open, looking at this originally difficult tough opponent, Richard is sneer, suddenly step forward, jump and fall, the whole action It’s so fast, the moonlight of the fire is falling directly from the behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sprinting behemoth’s body suddenly slammed, rubbing Richard’s body and rushing over, and ran straight out of the 100 meters before the limbs were soft and fell. On the ground, but the huge body still slides on the ground for dozens of meters. A blood line appears in the entire skull of the behemoth, and then it is divided into two pieces. The blood and the messy things are pouring out like dumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors of Iscara slowed down and gathered up again and again, and then a mushroom cloud rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 Finally moved, she strode forward, just a few steps, he crossed the kilometer, appeared in the side of Richard, and then cloud The wind cleared beyond Richard and continued to move forward. The flying pony tail leaped in front of Richard, and a few strands of hair even brushed the tip of Richard's nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, the blue-blue light is constantly blooming, gorgeous and beautiful, just like the blossoming blue flowers on the plain picture, this is silent The picture, as if time is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped the knife and looked at the figure in the electric light. For a moment, his heart was the ultimate silence. At this moment, his heart was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people smothered in the silent world until the silence was broken by a slap in the air: "Iscala, you give me out, just dare to hide Behind this group of soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunderous laughter in the air, and a huge figure appeared in the distant sky. This is a shape. Like the demon, the lower body is like a snake lizard, four short and thick feet support the fat body, and its upper body is the upper body of the devil, with a pair of ridiculous tattered flesh wings, the upper body is also thick and fat, It appeared as it was, then stood on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But compared with it, even the largest war behemoth in the Legion looks like an ant, this giant is likely to stand up to 10,000 meters, standing On the far side of the earth, it is a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Iskra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this real battlefield, quantity and volume represent power to some extent, at least in Isakara’s army, this principle is always followed. And the thirteen demon who annihilated the plane, when it was revealed, it would be difficult to put it all in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 is to see Iscara in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised the sky into Isakara and said, "You, just wait for me, I will come and fight with you." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iscara embraced her arms and laughed loudly: "Well, I am waiting here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whistling, the sky is shining Sudden, like a blue brontosaurus, rushed to Iscara, even before she and Iscara, there were millions of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of blue light shines on the earth, every time the light flashes, there will be a lot of open space, but there will be more empty space, and will be warriors of the demon god. Fill up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood quietly, watching the burning of himself, the final magnificence, and his heart was still blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if everything is blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s ear suddenly screamed: "Little guy, you should go back."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked subconsciously: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, go see your bastard dad." "茜's answer is beyond Richard's expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream of a dragon in the gray world, and the sky was flying through the sky at an incredible speed. Born to pierce a big hole in the void, it also shattered the rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard saw the crack in the space, he knew that it was time to go back. At this time, he did accompany him through the last part of his life. Really touching Iscara, the latter point is equally important, it determines whether Richard can avenge his enemies in the future, although the real enemy is the guardian elves who cursed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha vacated and flew to the space crack. Before passing through the crack, Richard looked back and saw the last smash . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard’s eyes, this is still a silent world. What Isakara seems to be roaring in the distance, and countless rays are shining in hundreds of eyes. The focus was all toward Richard, and hey, then he smiled arrogantly. She flew up into the sky, opened her arms, and a blue-gold light spread out, stopping the light of Iscara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-gold light curtain was so thin, but it was incredibly tough, not only blocking the attack of Iskara, but also stopping the tens of thousands of wizards who were preparing to jump in space in the Iscara army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, I have stopped Iscara and its entire legion with every effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless rays emanating from the petite body, and her image is beginning to blur, only the ponytail is still flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backing against Richard, he didn’t look back, just raised his hand and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iscara apparently lost calmness and snarled: "Leave,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its voice is like thunder, breaking the silence of the world, shaking the soul of Richard is shaking, this is the most direct soul attack, Richard can enter the space crack before the attack arrives, but there is no, but turned back glare With Iscara, exhausted all the anger to make the final embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equivalent to a direct collision between the two souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iscara took hold of Richard’s soul, but felt that he had caught a burning fireball, and the soul tentacles were burned innumerable, instinct The tentacles were loosened, and Li’s ears were roaring in the ears. Nothing could be heard in the blink of an eye. The consciousness was even blank. His body lost control and was slowly sucked in by the space cracks before the space cracks were closed. Richard only saw the unprecedented blue light shining in the distance, instantly lighting up the whole world... The next moment, Richard’s body appeared in the sly living room, slamming on the ground, he was lying quietly, moving Not moving, if there is not a slight ups and downs in the chest, it will almost make people think that he is a dead person, until Mei Lin’s exclamation came, only to wake up Richard from his meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline trembles said: "What happened, this...this is the warrior of the great elder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The reaction of Richard seemed to be very slow. He stood up for a long time and looked around. He stood in the living room of the hustle and bustle, and the bedroom disappeared out of nowhere. The bedroom was sent to him and he went to fight. Iscara’s vehicle, there is also a big hole at the top of the living room, and the sky is inserted on the floor. This time the war of the Elven Empire is dim, and there are many places at the gun and the handle. The traces of meltdown, forcibly penetrating the space, especially breaking the rule of Isakara's law, even the artifacts have to pay a heavy price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
