			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He constantly thought about it and conceived one parent after another. In this way, in the process of thinking and perfecting, Richard uses the infinite characteristics of the parent-child arms to explore the various arms and tactics for the construction of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dazzling starlight jumped into a galaxy in his eyelids, Richard suddenly realized that he was so focused on obscuring the opponent’s knight It seems that I want to move the battlefield to Noland. He will not only be an alien from the eccentric plane, but also a lot of strong opponents from Norland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is finally bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops of Richard once again set off for the final destination, Black Rose Castle, and by the military camp, more than 50 graves were set up and died. The elite squadron knights are buried here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the theory of the hen's nest, the best food for a combat unit is another combat unit, so the elite enemy of the war should not be wasted, and It should be eaten by other elite knights, but Richard is reluctant to do so. Even if he accepts the concept that the hens’ combat units are consumables, he will assign the most dangerous and highest-mortal tasks to them. Treating them as their own fighters will also give them a proper treatment for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just after Richard’s troops left, in the grove, a few unpredictable trees suddenly twisted, and the trunk became soft and sticky. Thick, smashed off a big piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sticky objects that fall down are constantly struggling and stretching, and after a moment they open their limbs and then stand up obliquely and become a few strange Creatures, their overall shape is somewhat human, but with a prominent face on their faces, and from the anti-joint legs, they are definitely not human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These singular creatures walked silently in the woods, leaving no traces in the past, as if the body had no weight, their march It's quite slow, but the surface of the body changes with the changes of the environment and light, so it is almost integrated with the environment. It is difficult to find them without careful observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target of these creatures was the new grave next to the woods. They came to the cemetery and immediately excavated carefully. A moment later, the body of an elite Knight of the Knights appeared in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature that is significantly larger than its companion extends its right arm, not at the end of the arm, but as a octopus tentacle The boneless fingers, whose hands touch the body of the elite knight, the soft fingertips have penetrated into the body of the body along the wound, constantly stroking and stroking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other creatures began to dig up several other graves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the biggest creature said in a strange voice and tone: "Sure enough, these knights of Richard are not humans, and they are not like natural creatures." With a few samples back, the owner will need them, and then clean up the scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words, it is actually using Noland humans The lingua franca says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the creatures agreed, and they speeded up the excavation speed. After a while, there were four creatures carrying six elite squadrons and a demon. The body of the ride left, and the three creatures remained in place and restored to the cemetery. They seemed to have a magical ability. It was not long before the graves that were dug were restored to their original appearance. In the words, even if Richard has the wisdom to remember the original cemetery, he will never know that the body under the grave has been stolen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard’s heart suddenly passed a feeling of discomfort, just like something was smashed with a cold, wet tongue, accompanied by There is some inexplicable sense of crisis, but this feeling is very pale and fleeting, so that Richard can't catch the source of their appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Black Rose Castle is already in sight, and Richard immediately picks up his mind and puts his attention on the final battle that will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovered the Yashan and Black Rose Fortress on the Yuanwang Peninsula, plus the family cemetery placed on the floating island, Richard is a gathering The sect of the Kimon patriarch can become the well-deserved patriarch of Akmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way forward, a man’s head was suddenly raised on a mound next to the road, and then the man ran to the back of the hill and turned over to the old castle. The direction is flying all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a whistle ride, and it is a less qualified whistle. Olal sneered and took off the long bow behind it. The distance is less than a kilometer. In this epic long bow and fine With the cooperation of the level magic arrows, it is not a problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Richard said faintly: "No need, an ordinary Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oral has slammed the longbow, and Richard’s followers are increasing, and each has its own powerful ability. The earliest of them have reached the 17th level, especially Tiramisu. The ogre is almost equivalent to two seventeen, and Oral is only the eleventh archer and the fourteenth level bard. The disadvantages of the double profession are undoubted, and he has to seize every opportunity to show his existence. So as not to be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, the scenery here is good, we can walk around and see." Richard pointed to the scenery on both sides of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a face to the famous Allianz Black Rose Castle in the League, but Richard is obviously not nervous at all. His relaxed attitude has also infected other people, followers. They became talking and laughing. Only Achilles and Senma were serious. They knew the defense of the Black Rose Castle. Lina was relaxed. She was not sure about the solidity of the Black Rose Castle. Have confidence in Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that." Oral first discovered the faint smoke rising from a distance, looking like a caravan, in the direction of the black rose Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard stopped the caravan, and the caravan master and the escort captain rushed to the front of Richard, almost turning his waist when he was bowing. Bent to the ground, especially the captain of the escort, the temperament of cultivation is biased towards the darkness, and the flames of the sacred unicorns on the silvery corners are seen, and even the legs are soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking a few sentences, Richard figured out the meaning of this caravan, this is the caravan that supplies supplies and food to the Black Rose Castle, and Purchase some antique furniture from the family council to offset the purchase price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a dozen carriages are loaded with food, bacon and a small amount of luxury goods, not worth a few dollars, but the family council has no money, in real wrestling In the eyes of Sauron, Goliath and Richard, the family council is just a tool. It is something that can be thrown when used. And the members of the house are really big people, a group of monkeys, no one wants to be in the monkey. Sauron is not willing to spend more money on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family council was not willing to be poor, and the income of the territory was to be paid to Sauron, and the military affairs could not be inserted, so the idea was hit on the collection in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, although the Black Rose Castle is a traditional family territory, there is no luxury item in Archimonde's tradition. Gordon inherits this tradition. In addition to defense, I have not spent much on the castle, and there are very few things that can be sold at a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family council is now selling furniture, and after a while, maybe the magical giants’ arrows will be removed and sold, maybe They will also regret that the permanent large trebuchet will be a pile of scrapped materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the statement of the owner of the caravan, Richard nodded and said: "The goods are left, you can go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan could hardly believe his ears and asked: "What, what do you say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated my own words and said, "Let me repeat the third time, I will kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am just a business person. The caravan owner called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and immediately calmed him down, then slowly said: "I have long declared that the family council is illegal, and this time. It is to announce the entire alliance and declare war on these rebel groups. You dare to do business with them at this time. Do you think that I dare not kill you? Who is behind you behind you, listen and listen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan immediately caught the straw and shouted: "I am Tudor..." The words were only exported halfway, and they were caught by the captain of the guard. The mouth was forced to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will leave, let's go." The guard captain dragged him away despite the struggle of the merchant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the back of their departure and smiled meaningfully, telling the knights to push the truck onto the grass, park it together, and then stand next to it. The block brand, written "owner Richard", took everyone to continue to the direction of the castle, and did not even leave a person to watch these goods, but Richard wanted to see it, this time, who else? Dare to move your own things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
