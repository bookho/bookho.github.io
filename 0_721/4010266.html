Richard smiled and said to himself, Suddenly turned his head and said: "I heard that he is your fiancé?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 stood behind Richard and said in a light voice: "It used to be." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you stand behind, don't let him see you, affecting his judgment." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪大大 unexpectedly, thought about it and said: "Master, Raymond has a deep affection for me. But there is no one in my heart. Location, I can stand by your side, this may hit him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard completely turned his head and took a deep look at Qi Qi. Suddenly smiled and said: "I am not testing you! You can rest assured that I will not test you in the future. As for Raymond..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李微微眯Eyes, looking at the distant Raymond, said faintly: "I have never been afraid of opponents who will seriously think, but only fear the already crazy guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞Qi some understand, and some do not understand, she should be, and retreated to the back of the two dukes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposite side of the stone hill, Noland’s soldiers did not need Raymond’s instructions to list their own formations, and the murderousness suddenly rose to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond was a cough again, and a violent pain in his chest made him bend down. When he stood up straight, the handkerchief was already a shocking red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled at the generals around him and said, "Nothing, cough up this time, I will not cough again in this battle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond said to a big magister: "Master, please help me, I need to fly, and then let my voice pass to the opposite side." In the ear of the ear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician nodded, and the staff waved, Raymond flashed magical light, and then ascended into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard!" Raymond’s fascinating words, but resounded throughout the battlefield under the power of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's Raymond!" Richard looked very relaxed, and didn't mean to compare with Raymond, just using directional sound. He reached out and stopped Oral, who wanted to put the arrow around. He couldn't shoot Raymond at this distance, and Raymond said it was the Noran Magician lingua franca. He was interested in listening to what the other party wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, we finally met on the battlefield." Raymond seemed to be very emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Your luck is good. After a while, you are not qualified to be my opponent. How, when playing tricks The tricks did not succeed, but instead lost their own brothers, and now I finally learned to fight in an upright manner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Akmund is not dead alone? ?" Raymond counterattacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard laughed: "The kind of idiot will actually believe you, naturally damn it. But is that also called Akmond a loss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiles," I am talking about a man named Gordon. The person who can't come out in the position of Qi Qi is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, the cold flashes, Immediately said nothing: "It is a giant, and occasionally it will be tripped by an ant. And ants can take this for a lifetime. However, in fact, the biggest mistake in your life is to send Gotton into the plane of Qi Qi. This gave me the opportunity to push me to this position. You will soon discover that the person sitting in the position of the Archimonean patriarch is me, and will make you more unhappy than Gotton!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond nodded and said: "Good! Richard, I really didn't misread you, you really qualify as my enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp Richard said with a sigh and said slowly: "If it was before today, maybe I will think like you. But now, I want to understand, you are not me at all." The enemy is just...a trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s face passed a burst of black air, suddenly laughing, turning back to the soldiers behind him Lan German shouted: "Norland's proud warriors, have you heard that? The opposite person, led a group of low-level soldiers, I feel that we are not qualified to be his enemy!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland in the square is dead, but the murderous is slowly rising. Noland's squadrons have experienced more than one plane war. Before these opponents from the lower level, they do not need to rely on howling roar to boost morale and threaten their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! Let me see, how much trouble can you bring me to Raymond!" Then Richard faced the army of his own arrogant array. Showing a brighter and more wild smile than the sky, "You, the invaders asked us to let out their homes." The coalition generals next to them suddenly indignant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned around and took a battle flag from the guard behind him. He forced it on the stone tower behind him and said: "I, Richard. Kemond, will stand before this battle flag, one step back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice resounded through the battlefield under the expansion of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the Faro coalition screamed and everyone was boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond fell back to the battlefield and said to the surrounding generals: "You, never penetrate the passage ahead, we will never return home! Now, It is time for us to defend the honor and dignity of the Noland soldiers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals went to Raymond one by one and walked to the square . From this moment on, they have to fight side by side with their own soldiers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond said to the old magician around him: "Master, from now on, I need you to protect me and let my order pass to every one. In the ears of the warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish!" The old magician was slightly owed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked at Richard, his right hand raised high, then fell, pointing to Richard, and said: "Noland, march!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first row of Noland reloaded the soldiers to take a heavy first step, Richard suddenly shocked his heart! This war may be more difficult than he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,000 to nine thousand, but the blood and meat strangles truly interpret the gap between the sub-plane and the main plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Norland people’s phalanx, like a tens of meters high wave wall, rolled in and ruthlessly flattened all obstacles in front of them, regardless of Stone pillars, traps, fortifications, or the other's warriors are all ruthlessly smashed before the waves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of Raymond, the Noland camp has a rhythmic contraction, popping, shrinking, and then popping up, like a swaying weight Hammer, slamming the fortifications of the Faroese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of magical arrows smashed the sky and fell to the top of the hill, and at the same time, the archers of Richard's archers were completely suppressed. Although the number of magic archers is only a few hundred, the magic arrows they shot are extremely powerful and have a long range. They directly occupy the advantage of the land, and the number of Faro archers in the number of more than three thousand is firmly pressed on the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled and everything went as he expected. Although Richard’s development in Faro was unexpectedly fast, but after all, the time was too short, and his main army was a Faro indigenous. As long as the Noland army reached its scale, it would not be possible for the Faroese to win by quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three lines of defense placed in front of the hill were flattened in a blink of an eye, and thousands of soldiers inside became corpses, they changed The result is only a few hundred Noland soldiers falling. Close to the battle-to-loss ratio of ten to one, let Richard's heartbeat gradually speed up. He tried his best to calm himself down. Now it is the time when the Noland soldiers have the highest physical strength and fighting spirit. Only by trying to withstand this round of offensive can they hold the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Norland warriors pushed too fast, and soon Richard could not stand it, and had to make an order in consciousness in advance. In the underground space at the center of the battlefield, a throwing soldier received an order from Richard, hitting the iron platform in front of him, and then a flame was ignited on the iron platform, divided into several lines of fire, along a root. The buried iron pipe burned in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the earth suddenly trembled, and a wave of spurts spouted under the Noland Army. The violent explosion would have hundreds of Noland warriors. Throw the sky. This comes from the surprise attack at the foot, but without any precursors of magical large-scale attacking spells, making Noland's military uniforms in a moment of chaos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morale of the Faro United Army is a vibration. However, Richard on the high platform saw this scene, but shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the explosion, there is still a lot of fluctuations in the power, not to mention the strongest of Noland, that is, those who have a little strength have their own I noticed that I had a defense in advance. Therefore, after a series of violent explosions, the final result was the killing of hundreds of ordinary fighters, and the temporary disruption of the Noland Army. This confusion, I believe Raymond will be able to adjust soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Raymond’s orders rang one after another, and one general led the soldiers under his command to attack in all directions. The original strict Norland battle immediately urged the Quartet. Expansion, and pierced several large holes in Richard's defense system. Then, from expansion to contraction, between one and one, the chaos has been controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are another row of Faro fighters standing up from behind the chest wall, the muskets they bought from the dwarf kingdom in their hands, shooting together. Thunderous gunshots instantly overwhelmed all the sounds on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the gunshots, only 90 of the Noland warriors fell. Heavy armor, shields and swearing, all make the power of the musket greatly reduced. But in the face of this unprecedented weapon, the frontline generals are still commanding the troops to shrink the formation, first stabilize the front line and then look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
