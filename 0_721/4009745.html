"Medred's big hand waved the lava and ran to the peak of miracles." Richard suppressed his own turbulent mood and followed him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-person five-ride ran for an hour before they finally reached the foothills of the miracle peak. Only at such a close distance, this peak of five kilometers in diameter and up to three kilometers really shows its majestic and extraordinary. The human vision can no longer fully accommodate the magnificent landscape in front of you. Whether you want to see the road or the mountain, you must constantly turn your head and adjust the angle of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin line that spiraled up the mountain along the road, now expands into a wide road that can accommodate four large carriages in parallel. The pavement is paved with irregular pieces of rock, but the splicing is seamless. The smooth surface is carefully viewed but covered with dense particles to prevent the ride and the wheels from slipping on it. On the outer edge of the road, handrails and guardrails are cast from cyan steel, and the top of each steel column is carved with a vivid World of Warcraft animal head. In the middle of the road there is a slightly raised rock band, painted bright yellow to distinguish between the up and down traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked up the road. Looking up from here, even if you look up to the angle parallel to the sky, you can only see a cloud of clouds covering the peak, it is hard to imagine the miracle above the clouds. However, he is good at mathematics. When he sees the slope of the road, he naturally calculates the total length of the road. It can be such a magnificent avenue. Every brick and stone, every inch of the guardrail is so delicate, how much does it cost to repair it all the way to the summit? Richard can hardly calculate this huge number! This feeling was only seen when he tried to calculate the cost of dark blue. Today, this is just the road to the city of miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Richard, look over there!" The voice of Modred came, and Richard looked in the direction he pointed, only to see One kilometer away, there is a strangely shaped building complex, the most obvious feature of which is the flat roof roof. From time to time, there are lions on the platform, a few steps to help, take off, and after a few laps in the air, start pulling the height and fly straight to the clouds at the peak of the miracle peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, the lion's back was loaded with one or two people and flew alone to the summit. But there were also groups of lions who set off at the same time. At that time, the scene was very spectacular. The wings of the gryphon group opened up, so that the sky was dark, and the majestic screams, even one kilometer away. Can be heard faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the Griffin Station. If you want to make it convenient, you can take them up and down the mountain in the future. But you can't bring your own ride. At the other end of the mountain, there are two two-legged dragon stations and two Morse Mountain Eagle stations. However, people in floating worlds can hardly endure the taste of the two-legged dragons, so they are mostly used for shipping. Licha, come with me, let's go up! This road is very long, you better give your horse some magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modre De shot the lava's neck, and the huge beast of the beast made a low-pitched sprint and ran into the road up the mountain. Although the boulevard is wide, there are many knights and various wagons on the road, almost crowded. Among the knights seen on the road, there are a lot of knights. Modred and the two-build knights are not so eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron hoof of the armored horse finally stepped into the clouds in the air, Richard already felt the faint magic flow in the cloud, which is hard to argue. Under the exploration, you will find that the veins of the flow are traceable, forming an invisible silk thread that does not condense. When Richard outlined these invisible magic lines in his heart, he was immediately taken aback, which turned out to be part of the magical array! If all the clouds have such magic threads, then this magic array should be huge and magnificent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
