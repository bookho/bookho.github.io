He reached out and touched the layer of blue dancing, but the fingers crossed the beautiful blue and touched her body. If there is a magical power that explodes in the place where the fingertips touch the skin, both Richard and Su Helun can't help but have a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shocked by the deep blue sigh of beauty and mystery. Richard didn’t have time to use the language. He couldn’t even use the perception to describe the feeling at the moment. He suddenly found that boiling. The deepest part of the blood itself, and the fierceness of the unprecedented momentum, can not be contained, and once again swept his already paused consciousness. His hand was involuntarily led by the male instinct to explore and follow the legendary Master's smooth thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that he suddenly ignited a volcano! With a bang, Su Hailun is like a ignited torch. The whole body is spraying blue flames. The mysterious lines on the surface of the body are thicker and eventually turn into a deep blue. She bit her teeth, lifted up Richard, and the majestic magic poured into Richard's body, so his body began to shoot out the elemental storm. In the storm, Richard The clothes were smashed into pieces and then smashed into fly ash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Richard was thrown to the ground. The ground was very hard, and the impact was extremely heavy, but the magic that Su Hailun poured in still ran through every cell in the body, and he did not feel pain at all. It was just a violent shock or paralysis of the limbs, so that he could not climb for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the legendary mage did not suppress the bloody blood that was thoroughly violent in Richard’s body. He lay on his back, and the proof of the mature man was stabbed. The sky, pointing to Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Su Hailun almost squeezed out the words from her teeth. She suddenly plunged ten meters and appeared above Richard. Then Straight down. And the blue light belt she pulled out in the air, but like a huge light wing almost obscured most of the space, brilliant and beautiful will not easily dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s body instinct rises upwards, greets the dazzling and fascinating temptation, and screams like a wild beast from the throat. He only felt that a certain part of his body suddenly fell into a mysterious zone, hot, humid, and powerful. Every powerful squirm in that zone caused a crushing effect on his nerves, which made him unable to help himself. I want to bark. And he also countered instinctively, his hands climbed on her thighs, clenched, and made every effort to deepen his most sensitive parts, deeper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage's small eyebrows are first wrinkled, then gradually stretched, and finally slowly erect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of fate, in the dark blue dream, the boy became a man. When the seven-stringed moon is hung at the same time, and the night is also dyed into seven colors, the fate of many people has changed since then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special day will pass, even if it is the day of fate. When the morning sun shone on the body, Richard gradually woke up, and the new day began again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that Su Helun did not leave, but was still asleep, in the morning, her body was flawless, like ivory luster flowing, The two faint stuns on the chest seemed to feel the gaze of Richard, and began to tremble slightly. On her body, those dark blue magic lines that were last night were gone, and everything that happened was just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so beautiful, but the posture of the two people is slightly problematic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Richard is curled up, his head is in the arms of Su Helun, his hands and legs are wrapped around her, as if she is afraid that she will escape. And it seems to be insecure. The legendary mage was lying on his back, his right arm was covered with Richard, and he slept with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning was the most energetic moment for men, and gradually recalled the experience of last night, and then saw Su Hailun who was still asleep, he couldn’t stand it anymore. The hand quietly started moving. Richard's slight little action immediately awakened the legendary mage. She first lazily stretched out her laziness, and slammed her hand on her own body, which opened her eyes reluctantly. But she immediately felt very uncomfortable, because a hot and hard thing was on the hip side, still active, so she instinctively reached out and grabbed it, and Richard immediately snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage turned his head and stared at the shining eyes, and looked at Richard for a while, and the depths of the pupil gradually became more beautiful. So Richard knew that she really woke up at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Li lying next to him, Su Hailun did not have any surprise at all, but first reached out to cover his mouth and comfortably played a few Yawning, and then stretched a few times. Richard is constantly sulking, because when Su Hailun is mobilized, his right hand has been holding his vital parts. The sight that was seen in front of him was so spurting, so that he almost spewed the essence again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage sat up and looked at Richard, actually asking: "I still want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's face flushed, but nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is the most energetic time, and wisdom is worth three years in a year, but it’s serious It’s just the maturity of 17 or 18 years old. When I became a man for the first time, it was a man who became a woman in the unparalleled style of Su Hailun. Of course, I would like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times do you want?" The legendary Master began to laugh again. The gentle and bleak woman last night seemed to be really just a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seriously began to think seriously. The limit of this body is still unclear, but one thing is very clear, that is, how many times is not enough. He even felt that he was now energetic and could continue to rush to the second rise of Chaoyang! The blood is in the doldrums, fully support the madness of Richard, and he is willing to be squeezed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three times, no... five times..." Richard hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun suddenly laughed loudly, his right hand twitched a few times, and almost collapsed the Richard who had stood on the edge of the cliff. Then she stood up, waved her new underwear and mage robes, and began to wear herself, and said, "It’s dawn. So... no more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Great loss... Richard silently, then stood up. He saw a full man's clothes in the corner of the bedroom, and he knew that it was his size under the visual inspection, so he went over and put it on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting on the clothes, Richard felt that he was a lot less, and Su Helun was not the woman who made him completely crazy last night, she was in front of her. It has restored the identity of the legendary mage and is as natural as ever, as if nothing had happened. However, Richard could not adapt at the same time. Two completely different legendary mages overlapped in front of his eyes, making him unable to tell whether he was dreaming last night or this morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun looked at Richard, and then walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking the magnificent scene of the rising sun rising slowly from the Hengdong Mountains. He said slowly: "Do you have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sorted out his mood and forced to calm down and asked: "Why? Also, what do you need me to do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why?" The legendary Master smiled crisply and shrugged and said, "What is wrong with this? Very simple, my sister, I am in a bad mood recently, so I am cheaper! It is so simple! Well, if you have to find a reason, then the reason for being fresh and delicious is enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at some of Green’s face, Su Helun Can't help but laugh even louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to laugh, she said: “In fact, if you say it seriously, there are reasons. That’s my sister’s biggest hobby, that is, in those futures. The strong man who may change the history of the mainland leaves a shadow that cannot be erased. Only everyone is different, so the way to attack these guys and leave a psychological shadow is different. And for you, I want to think about it, that is, the best method last night, eat you! In the future, every time you look for a woman, you can't help but think of me, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The legendary Master’s expression and tone are very sloppy, and Richard can only be speechless. When she laughs again, she repeats the second question: “So what do you need to do in the future?” The word "future" is especially emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future....The future...." Su Hailun suddenly stunned, she sighed, stretched out her left arm, rolled up her sleeves, revealing a soft forearm . Then, under the snow-like skin, the silky blue magic lines began to emerge again. "Deep blue sigh is a six-level magic pattern. Now the Noland continent has only knowledge about the five-level magic pattern. So if you want to finish it, you must go deep into the infinite plane to find deep blue sighs. The secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will explore the plane." Richard said calmly, no swearing swears, no excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will wait for you!" The deep blue magical pattern faded away, and Su Hailun lifted the bright face and restored the arrogant True color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard now knows that the savage, unscrupulous legendary wizard that everyone sees is not the real Su Helun, in the middle of the night last night. At that time, I was sighed in the dark blue smoldering fire. Or both are Su Hailun, just like him, one of them is deeply buried in a place that no one can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is already bright, and the day of destiny becomes the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the silence of the early morning, Richard left the private area of ​​Su Helun. When the magic door was closed behind him, he couldn't help but stop and look back. The two worlds are separated again, and the next time the magic door opens in front of him, but I don't know when it will be. Su Hailun’s last embarrassment is still lingering in his ear: “The last night’s things must not be said!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha certainly won’t say it, this matter This experience, he will be deeply buried in the bottom of my heart, as the most precious treasure, carefully collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other statement of the legendary mage, but his long-stained face emerged with a looming smile. Su Hailun ate his life for the first time, and claimed to leave him a shadow of the soul, and she did succeed, and in the heart of Richard has been branded with her shadow, it will never kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
