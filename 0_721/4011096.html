			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let us give it up!" The ogre lord eyes flashed fiercely. The hatred accumulated in the years of Faro is unforgettable for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "We have limited time. I am afraid that there is not so much energy to deal with the Reaper. But after I go back, there will always be a way to come again." The dark side of the world, at that time is the moment of the reaper's demise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating is turning smoothly in the void, and it is gradually showing a huge transmission in front of it. door. The legendary city jumped into the portal and jumped out of millions of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus jumped again and again, and Richard forced himself to calm down and continue to resolve the rules of the dark side. The more rules are resolved, the more coping will be in the face of possible attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, and in the void for nearly a month, Richard finally came to the area marked in the star. During this period, there was no accidental harassment by the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the perception, a small chaotic land mass appeared. It is like an island, floating in the void, and even smaller than the floating world. On the island, there is a blue shield that protects a small area inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also saw the shield made up of star power, but he did not immediately rushed over, but ordered vaot to slow down and finally stopped in the void. Down, the color turned cold, saying: "Ready to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating paused for a moment, then the light of the rainbow suddenly increased several times in July, the first floating The island returned to the center of Fauveur, while the rest of the floating island changed its trajectory and began to fly around the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fauna, a frame of magic is constantly busy, interspersed back and forth between the various nodes, quickly set up and proofread the data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the temple buildings slowly moved to reveal the deep hole below. Then, a giant crystal column of up to several hundred meters rose from these holes, and for a time it added a few points to SF. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the control of the hall, no face floats in the air. Dozens of crystals are shining on her body, creating a huge light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real control device of FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint smile on the maskless face, saying in a voice that only you can hear: "I will help you once again... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked shocked at the seven giant crystal columns on the floating world. Although he claimed to have all the authority of FS, he also thought that he had studied the use of fascist quite thoroughly, but did not expect that FS has this form! I am afraid that even the clergy of the old dragons never knew that the temple where they lived could move all the way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All along, Richard thought that FS can be started, and the super-defense system of the Rainbow in July is already a miraculous masterpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think about whether this floating city had offensive facilities, but Faust was falling on Noland’s, and the damage was normal. Usually the defense facilities are a little stronger than the offensive facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Richard has embarked on the road of true power. In his opinion, there is no difference between ukiyo-to and no means of attack. Personal combat power will not be much worse than the legendary battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard has not been too concerned about it. The main purpose of this trip is to suppress the will of Abyss. After entering the dark side, Faust has become a mobile fortress and a special road tool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, this city of wonders has been revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, the battleships of countless reapers began to appear, and there were many starship-class warships that were even larger than the floating world. The size of the Reaper army is much larger than the fleet within the plane of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, the nervous voice sounded again: "My dear little builder! You finally came here! Ah, you can’t imagine it, I have waited for you for a long time, and I have found a long road in the sea of ​​destiny, only to find the unique line of destiny! This is a hard, boring, desperate road, but! I finally reached the end! The end point is you, my dear Richard!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp voice trembles as if it has reached **. The content of the discourse makes Richard one of the most embarrassing. Is all the conspiracy, the ultimate goal is to be yourself? Richard does not feel that he has such great value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really can see me." Richard sneered. "I have already made a sixth-order structure, and it is not worth your attention. This gentleman who can direct the reaper! In one of the world lights, Binolan There are more than one plane with a higher level of German power. There are not many artifacts in the sixth-order structure, and there are not many artifacts. There is not only one who has the potential to reach the peak of the world. Is this adjective unique and exaggerated?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no! There is no exaggeration at all, you don't know your true value at all!" The voice said in an aria of rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is my value? Blood? Oh, Archimonde and Silvermoon Elf are not a strong race."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not the blood! More powerful blood than Akmon and Silvermoon Elf, I can count dozens now. Your value is the one that sees through the essence of the world." Power! How, my dear little Richard, I have already revealed the answer in advance, this is a small reward for you finally appearing here. Now, it is time to harvest. Before you finally get caught, Try to resist it! This will allow me to experience the pleasure and the maximum... **!!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneer, play with his hands A small crystal, said: "Reassured! My resistance will definitely exceed your expectations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating, a red crystal giant column Suddenly lit up, then a few meters of blood-colored light column spanned hundreds of kilometers, and instantly shot on a reaper's star ship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starship became transparent in the blink of an eye, and the whole body became red, then violently exploded, turning into a huge fireball, and rolling hundreds of battleships around. Into it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard looked awkward under the strong ray mapping. He knew that the attack power of fascist must be great, but he did not expect it to be so big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an amber beam of light was shot, and the battleship of hundreds of reapers was also bombarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's huge fleet of warships also began to move, and countless destruction beams spanned tens of kilometers, spurting on the shifude's protective cover. In the void, there are high-frequency whistling sounds that human ears can't capture. A metal kinetic energy bomb breaks through the incredible high-speed blast, continuously bombarding fascin, and blooms on the protective cover. Fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow flashed in July. The huge energy is extracted from the void and injected into the shield to resist the attack of the reaper. The energy level pumped by FS is terrible, but under the intensive attack of the reapers, the hood still fluctuates and becomes more and more unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, an azure crystal column that has never been moved suddenly flashes, and the blue light curtain spreads out, and the outer protective cover And for one. The protective cover that is already breaking is once again intact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and still observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reaper's nest, not Faro, he does not believe that the reaper has no more means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, hundreds of huge portals suddenly appeared in the distant sky, and the fleet of countless reapers sprang out from the portal, like countless blacks. Tide, rush to the floating world! As soon as he looked at it, he discovered that the number of reapers exceeded one million! And in the portal, the ship is constantly transmitting out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper seems to never have the limit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not over yet. In the farther void, there are three giant portals up to hundreds of kilometers, and then three huge shadows are transmitted from The door is slowly pouring out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three indescribable monsters, a mixture of flesh and metal and metal, which does not reveal any characteristics of normal creatures. They have no eyes, no mouth, limbs, teeth, nothing. They are like three huge garbage, slowly rolling over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if there is no ability, it is extremely huge, it gives people endless pressure! What's more, how can these three behemoths, which are the final weapons, not have special abilities? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha doubles and says, "It seems that I am active."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No face said: "Go! Fight in the dead, don't be as cool as other people. If you kill slowly, I can be dangerous here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While constructing the portal, Richard said, "How can I be so naive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
