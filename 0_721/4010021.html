			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane portal explosion shocked the entire Holy Alliance, although it has not yet arrived The extent of the situation affecting the entire continent has indeed given many sensitive people new ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s army has been trapped in the exclusive position of the Mensa family, although judging from the time of the explosion, the other army should have gone out of the channel without being directly Loss, but almost no one is optimistic about the future of Gordon. An army that has lost its logistical supply is in a bad situation, no matter how it can be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between Archimonde and Mensa, Joseph and Schumpeter is undoubtedly the core of the recent political sacred alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, Archimonde swept an aspect of the Schumpeter family with an unstoppable offensive, and then in the Noland Ground War. The defeat of Joseph and the bear Peter United. The voice of Gordon was unparalleled in the Holy Alliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war with the Mensa family has just begun, and Gordon has attacked the exclusive plane of Saskatchewan with an unprecedented momentum, but did not expect a sudden sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows why Archimonde’s portal suddenly explodes, and the portal that has established a stable plane channel should be very stable according to common sense. The plane between the plane and Noland is tied to the chain, otherwise there will not be so many people who want to get the coordinates of the opponent's exclusive plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in history, there are not many occurrences of fixed-channel portal explosions, and there are only a handful of accidents. Of course, the probability of accidents in unstable channels is large. Much more, basically more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two hours after the plane's portal explosion, Goliath got the news. His territory is very close to the Black Rose Castle, and he is a half-brother with Gordon. His branch and the residents of Yaning have many blood relatives who are not three generations. It is almost the first to get news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the news and calmly confirming, Goliath walked into the big study room of his castle, locked the door and sat for a whole day. One night, I didn’t say a word, and I didn’t eat. Until the dusk the next day, he walked out of the room, managed the territory as usual, and operated the plane, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at dusk, Ellie also got news that she was reviewing her army. It was a small, well-equipped and striking force. When the right-hand man told her the news, Ellie, who had never been ill, was sluggish, and the long sword in her hand quietly landed, but she was unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the next moment she returned to normal, raising her hand, the landing sword flew back to her hand, and then said to the assistant: "Nothing, Don't have any movements, wait a while to say. Gordon the guy will always create a miracle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." The assistant said respectfully, Then she thought about it and whispered: "Adult, floating island of 浮..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Ellie slammed her head and said, "I forgot this! You immediately send a few powerful people... No! You personally go to Faust, and then live in the floating island 7-2. Let's go right away!" Her territory was far from the Yaning Peninsula, and she did not deliberately leave a spy there. It was a bit late to know the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alize's assistant is also a young and beautiful woman, but the murderous murder is always reminding people that she is definitely not a woman who can be despised. And Alice’s attention to her can also prove this. Hearing the instructions of Alize, the female assistant’s fighting spirit and murderousness burst at the same time and said with scorn: “The adults can rest assured that I will grab the floating island!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellie stunned and said with a smile: "What do you want to do with the flashy thing! After you enter the floating island, the only task is to stare at Richard and see if he will suddenly appear. I have a hunch recently, Richard is always It is possible to return to Noland. The place where he is most likely to appear is ukiyo-d. If he returns, and Gordon has not returned yet, then you must do whatever it takes, and must get him. "My land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee? Is that the sacred sect of the future? But there are many people who have his ideas..." Worried about Zhong Zhong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellie’s lips showed a faint smile and said, “Whatever you fear, as long as he arrives at my site. Who wants to take Richard away? Let them try it. Don't forget, my title is the military god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant showed helpless laughter and whispered the owner "But there are only a handful of people who admit your title!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much does it matter? Anyone who has played with me has recognized this title. That is enough!" said Alize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant nodded and had some confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-and-white castle’s plane portal suddenly blows up, and the speed of the message spreads even faster than the seismic wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was the time when the floating meeting of the House of Lords was held, so from the morning, the parliament square was full of luxury horse-drawn carriages. This is a rare phenomenon in peacetime, because almost all real powers know the accident of the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords is a huge and white building. The twelve white giant stone pillars are magnificent, but have no other role than decoration. The House of Lords, which can hold thousands of people, is like these twelve pillars. It was originally a flashy institution. Because the seats in the House of Lords include all the floating island giants of FS, they are usually not attended. Any resolutions formed by the House of Lords also do not have any restrictions on the floating islands. Every floating island is a giant door to pave the way with blood, killing all the way. Therefore, if you want to constrain these giants, you must also be prepared to pay for your blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the meeting time was over, most of the seats in the theater-style conference hall of the House of Lords were filled with people, but that was only in the outer circle. Of course, there are not so many people who are eligible to participate in the House of Lords, but many people who have the means to find ways to get the qualifications to attend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the circular venue, there is a luxurious and luxurious seat. Each chair has exquisitely carved high feet, a crown-shaped backrest, and an oversized exaggerated armrest that is twice as large as an ordinary chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the exclusive seat of the floating island giants, the silver seats, even the royal family is no exception, and can only occupy a position here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In normal times, those positions that represent supreme power and luxury are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the meeting was held, the door suddenly sounded again, and a luxury carriage stopped in front of the steps. Then a full-length dress and gray-haired old man strode up the stairs and entered the venue. He just stepped into the venue, and people immediately slammed and talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that the patriarch of the Schumpeter family? How did he come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah! Xiong Peter is not a bad man, is he desperately trying to intercept the Anan family who entered the vassal? How can he still feel here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Does he still want to sit on the silver throne in the middle of the field?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the war with Gordon, Schumpeter had two defeats, and even the most prolific exclusive planes were captured. The Knights of the Knights were completely annihilated. At least half of the family's strength has been cleared. It is a foregone conclusion that the floating island will be cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles have a minimum of style. Since they used to be floating island nobles, they must not bend to the ordinary family who only settled in the main city of Faust, or use blood. To defend the status of overlooking all beings, or to withdraw completely. It’s just that people didn’t expect that the patriarch of the Bear Peter family would appear in the venue on the eve of being cleared of the floating island. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after Xiong Peter, the representatives of the floating island giants appeared one after another, filling the silver seats in the center of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, people are in a daze, the representative of the Holy Alliance royal family, Prince Morton, even came to the venue! At this point, the silver seats were almost fully occupied, and only the seats of the Archimonde and Mensa families were still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-informed people know that they are the protagonists of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep outside the venue, and people immediately exclaimed, because the Mensa family was present, and it was not an ordinary representative, but the Duke of Mensa himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s spirit is strong, and the pace is strong, striding to his seat, but not eager to sit down. As his gaze passed over the empty seats of Archimonde, there was a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menza did not sit down, but raised his hands, so the entire venue gradually quieted down. Subsequently, the Duke’s vigorous and powerful voice heard the venue:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Sirs, I have two important news to tell you before the meeting. First of all, it was a heavy bad news. The face of the Mensa family was a rich plane named after my beautiful granddaughter. An abnormal situation occurred, and the plane portal leading to Noland was suddenly blown up. The blow was that the number of the plane in the Eternal Dragon Hall disappeared. The story was not completely lost, and the venue suddenly disappeared. The disappearance of the plane number means that this plane is separated from the system of the Eternal and Time Dragon, and becomes a free plane. Not only does re-establishing the plane of the plane mean a huge overhead, and it is not known whether the original plane coordinates will continue to be valid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expression of the Duke of Mensa was very intriguing, and lost such a rich plane, it seems that there is no unpleasant look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few insiders know in advance that Gordon’s offense is the 珞 位 plane! People who don't know, as long as they are not too stupid, link the two messages and almost can guess the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
