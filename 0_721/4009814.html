			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle that maintains a fragile balance ends with the addition of two powerful ogre be broken. Exhausted warriors, even the captive knights, could not withstand the magical ogre impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang of the bang, the captive knight who made a frontal collision with the three-pointer retreats, the deformed left arm hangs on the side of the body, and the shield is also deformed. Depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no one to hammer down the opponent who was nearly exhausted, and suddenly let the ogre violently get angry. He screamed and the hammer was picked up again, so the captain was like a broken puppet, flying far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed straight up the body, slamming his chest, the roaring sounds resounding in all directions: "The damn flesh, who wants to come up?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one responded to the ogre's trenches. He was not blessed with the effect of language, so roaring in the ears of the enemy is meaningless barking, of course, the name of Sir Mintel is the same in the ears of three-pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed indulge in screaming, Tiramisu has quickly crossed by him, heavy hammer waving, stumbled a warrior who could not escape . Three minutes of anger, screaming and chasing Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two newly added ogres are the last boulder to overwhelm the camel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Mintel and the remaining dozens of men were surrounded by an open space at the corner of the base. Mintel’s helmet didn’t know where to go, sweat drenched his hair and stuck it on his forehead. The shield on his left hand has a crack, the edge is slightly deformed, and the heavy hammer of the right hand is getting heavier and heavier. Every muscle in his body is sore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Min Tai looked behind him, leaving only two sealed knights and a dozen warriors, all wounded. The opponents include Gangde and seven stepping knights, as well as two powerful ogres. The elf bard squatted on the roof, and the hand holding the longbow had been trembled because of fatigue, but he persisted in scorning the damn battle song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mintel’s eyes fell on Richard, the sand and the water. The sand drifting is like not seeing Minta's beast-like gaze, but the book that flips the time. It puts the gods in the first row of Gangde and the stepping knight. Although it was only a few treatments, it was irritating that Mintel was almost mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is this woman! This god is almost inexhaustible woman, pull back the fallen opponents from the death line, and then push back to the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the war, the two formerly wounded knights who had not been healed were only self-inflicted, and now they face the injured opponents, they also become A force that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee sent Gotton with his nameless knife on the ground, stepped forward and said to Mintel: "Surrender, Sir Mintel. Don't Let these brave warriors make fearless sacrifices again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai haha ​​laughed a few times, then replied with scorn: "Suspend? What can you open?" Conditions come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "If you swear allegiance to me, of course it is the best choice. Otherwise, you are my captive, I will inform Baron Fossa, let him pay the ransom for you and give me a piece of land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream!" Sir Mintel snarled, and once again clenched the hammer in his hand. "The believers of the courageous god will never compromise with the invaders! The chores of your bitch will only bring looting and killing. And destruction! No one will cooperate with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "As far as I know, the god of courage is not the only god, this There are many other gods in the plane, and even the hostile god of the god of courage. In addition, not all people have faith, I can always find someone who is willing to do things for me. So, Sir Mintel, your value is not yours. I thought it was so high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai sighed heavily on the floor and sneered and said: "Dignity and faith are my values! Dogs and mothers The hybrid, dare not fight with me? I am not vindictive, still able to pinch your eggs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the "breeding of the bitch", Richard’s eyes suddenly violently beat a few times, and he quietly stepped back two steps, holding the backhand and inserting it on the ground. Long knife handle. His hand holding the knife was so hard that the blade was trembled slightly, and the long five fingers began to shine with the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Min Tai’s eyes smashed, and the body subconsciously whispered as if he had seen a dangerous beast. Although he wondered why a mage was holding a knife that was too long, but there was a surprise in his heart, this young mage was obviously the leader of the invaders. If he could catch him, then he was hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and the water are all close to Richard, and Gangde has turned his body. The big axe has the most comfortable position, which can be the first time. Intercepting Mintai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence on the battlefield, only the snoring from which corner I didn’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out to Gangde and said, "Gunde, wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde A glance, muttered something, or took off the silver jug ​​at the waist, unscrewed the lid, and handed it to Richard. Li looked at it and looked at it. He looked up directly and drunk the spirits in the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, poison!" Water peanuts are hard and cold reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shuihua! You..." Gangde turned back and glared at the water. Shuihua scored back to the past without hesitation, and at the same time intentionally raised the guide of the eternal sleep held in his arms, so the momentum of Gangde immediately weakened by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few big mouthfuls of wine into the abdomen, Li's face quickly glowed with a layer of fainting, and his eyes brightened with dark night stars. He threw the empty jug to Gangde, holding the right hand of the knife, and releasing one finger and one finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the sky and exhaled a thick drink, only to look back to Mintai, faintly said: "This is a plane battlefield, not a nobleman. The living room, so you don't have a chance to fight! Everyone gives me and kills him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mintai screams to start charging and immediately encounters the first wave The sturdy line of defense, the ogre and Gangde were successfully intercepted by the swiftness of the huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz in desperation gave off amazing power, and the impact of the three-headed hammer and the heavy hammer axe shook the earth, actually shook the Gangde and the ogre . But a khaki-colored magic light shone on Mintai, and his footsteps immediately stepped into the muddy swamp, and the action slowed more than one beat. This is the delay of tiramisu. Then the Ogre Magi also lifted the hammer and copied it from the side. Two relatively good paced knights filled the final gap in the encirclement, and five people were firmly trapped in Mintai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
