After the iron ingot, it is 600,000. If you attach the magic, then it is 700,000. After deducting the cost, you can earn at least 100,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Lan reluctantly sighed and said: "I really don't want to be a little guy out of dark blue! Well, I will help you with the magician and craftsman. In addition, these enchanted cloud iron ingots are sold to me. Well, I bought it for 700,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem! Those Lafite irons are included." Richard replied neatly Let Nolan slime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a lot of secular interests behind Nolan’s great priests, and from the sip of so many enchanted cloud iron ingots, the forces behind her are also Not too small. At least financial resources can surpass Archimonde. As for how the cloud iron ingots are digested, she can profit from it, and Richard does not care. If there is not enough interest to drive, who will do it without compensation? As long as the price is within his psychological price, it is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is tight, Richard first called a temple guard, sent a message to Nyris and Agamemnon, and then continued to deal with the ore. thing. He opened the magic box that he had brought back. The box is divided into upper and lower layers. Most of the lower layers are Yuntie ore, and the upper layer is two small and exquisite sealed boxes. Richard carefully took out the box and checked it out. He found it intact, and he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan saw Richard’s move and suddenly said: “Richard, Yuntie’s money can be prepaid. Do you want gold coins or something else? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you buy a sacrifice?" Richard asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan smiled and said, "If you want to sell, then I will accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaha laughed a few times, and the original thoughts were eliminated. It seems that the sacrifice can be folded into gold coins, but only the gold coins can't be changed. For the purpose of selling the income of the cloud iron, Richard had already prepared, first took a scroll made of enchanted paper from his arms and handed it to Nolan, saying: "The magic materials listed above, if any, Please also help me collect some more. If there are extra parts, I want to buy a space equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan opened the scroll and carefully read it again. I said, "In addition to a few things, the materials on the list can be obtained, but it takes time. It seems that this time is too late. But hundreds of thousands of gold coins can not buy good space equipment. I am a friend There is just a space box ready for transfer, the external size is similar to the small magic box on your hand, inside is two cubic meters of space, and there is a magic effect, but can not lose weight. If you want, I want 300,000 gold coins can be bought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Okay! I want it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space box itself is not very good, but the price given by Nolan is 20% lower than the market price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Richard did not expect to have left the temple, and the materials he brought back were mostly shot. The trading of hundreds of thousands of gold coins seems to be very satisfying to both parties. Of course, Richard is more satisfied. Between leaving the temple, Richard asked Nolan to help prepare for the transfer. At most this time tomorrow, he was ready to return to the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Gangde just returned to the floating island, and Nyris arrived. The four princes reacted quickly, which surprised Richard. He even wondered if the prince had nothing to do all day, so he was able to follow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the first sight of Richard, Nyris apparently stayed for a while, then his eyes were beaming, and he said loudly: "Hey! Richard, it’s only a few days, how can you change so big! The beard is handsome. Staying! And cutting so rough, it’s just art!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Neri’s eyes, it’s almost going to touch a few It is. Richard touched his hard short hair and was speechless. During the war, Richard didn't have time to make a beard. After the war, he felt that the hard and short-haired feel was good, and he habitually left his beard. However, Richard did not have the luxury to be equipped with a special hairdresser. He just looked at the mirror every morning and used his first job to repair it twice. Don't say the royal family, there are many people in the aristocratic giants who spend an hour a day tidying up their hair and beard. Seeing the well-trimmed beard and looking at Richard's short beard, Nyris naturally feels rough and hard. But he thought that it was tangible and made Richard very speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Nyris’ eyes are getting brighter and brighter, in order to prevent him from doing something, Richard directly puts a box of magic into his arms. Li: "Hold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" Nyris’s attention was actually transferred by the magic box. He opened the box and looked at it. A low cry: "The wild barrier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five sets of different shapes in the box, which is a complete set of wild barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of war, the barbaric barrier is more practical than the wilderness strike. At this time, less than ten days after Richard’s last departure, Nyris received a second set of installations, naturally excited. In a sense, his fate has been linked to Richard, and the better he performs, the higher his status will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! I will give you the materials. And this time I can prepay 15 sets of materials and book the next three sets of wild Barriers." Said, Nyris is ready to run out, it seems that he wants to go back to the palace warehouse to take materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Richard quickly pulled the impatient Nyris and said, "I still have a lot of materials in my hand. Material. But I hope to use this reward to buy a batch of magic equipment, I don't know if you can help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of materials? I am really right. Your success rate is very interesting." Nyris looked at Richard deeply, his eyes were a little embarrassed. Fortunately, he immediately returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic equipment? A little thing! What are you going to want, how much?" Nyris squeaked his chest. This is a heroic action, but he always makes people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he was overjoyed, so he said: "I also want a batch of magical swords with double enchanting effects, fine-grade materials, the number will come five hundred." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five hundred...oh, okay, ah! How much?" Neris said that afterwards, it was simply a scream, and the sound of the voice was miserable. To a group of satyr girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s screams also shocked Richard. He examined what he had just said and determined that it was a fine sword. Instead of an epic or even a legendary sword, this says: "Five hundred, how, a lot? In the market, such a sword is only two thousand? According to the last price, five hundred swords It is 750,000 gold coins, which is exactly the same as the construction materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has already seen some forehead sweat, and said with a smile: "This, price No problem, but the number is really too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
