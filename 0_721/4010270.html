My life, even the grace of the eternal and the dragon of time can't be saved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the Joseph family was very poor recently. There is no ability to sacrifice, and It is two different things to get the grace you need." Richard sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life torrents can't save my life, it has nothing to do with enough sacrifices." Raymond said indifferently, "In addition, the eternal and time dragon The grace of God may not be as omnipotent as you think. It is not a good thing to rely too much on God's grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Excessive dependence God is not a good thing? Most people don't think so. Why should I believe in you between most people and one person? Are you wise at most people in Noord? At least now, you The army is covered in my hands, and you have become my captives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond has always kept calm and calm, saying: "Our Solomon Scholars Master, the whole life is to explore the truth of the whole world. Between me and most people, the fault is likely to be the majority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just snorted, not ready to continue to bicker with Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He communicated his mother’s nest in consciousness, and discussed it for a while. After a while, he flew from the direction of the mother’s nest as if it was magnified dozens of times. Mosquito-like insects. The worm fell directly on Raymond's arm, and the sharp-skinned mouthparts smashed into the flesh, causing Raymond's face to be pale and cold sweat rolling down his forehead. The giant mosquito quickly sucked the blood of the stomach and injected some liquid into Raymond's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the warmth of the flow spread out in Raymond’s body, which made him feel refreshed and felt a lot lighter in his body. Dead tissues and organs are gradually gaining new life. But at the same time, Raymond found that his magic is slowly dissipating and falling. The level of his master has also decreased, and it has been reduced to ten. At this time, the magic inside his body is empty, and he can't even mobilize it. Even a magic can't be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond felt the condition of his body and was surprised: "It's amazing! I have to admit that you can always do miraculous things." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, falling in my hand, if you want to die, it is not so easy." After that, Richard ordered the guard to bring Raymond first. Go down and shut it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When being towed away, Raymond replied: "Lee, put a Solomon Scholars Master on your side, you will regret it sooner or later!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "I was not afraid of you before. Now that you are in my hands, can I still be afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, thousands of Faroese fighters are cleaning the battlefield. These are the warriors of the Richards, and the aristocratic coalition forces have been withdrawn from the battlefield at this moment and are not allowed to enter the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility did not have much controversy about this. On the one hand, everyone lost a lot of money, and the high-ranking aristocrats were mostly leading generals. Many people were still lying in the camp to cultivate. Even if someone is dissatisfied, seeing the mother's nest in the middle of the battlefield at the moment, wisely withdraw the protest into the stomach. It has been spread on the battlefield. This is the queen of the war behemoth Ahn'Qiraj, which has not appeared in the history of Faro for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hen's nest, the humanoid knight, and Richard's dozens of riders are so powerful that they are incredibly large. It is enough to wipe out all the troops left by the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the masked female magician around Richard made them feel awe, no one could see through her strength. In Faro, the wizards who can summon the dragons belong to the legendary characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Duke of Glasgow inadvertently mentioned that the female magician’s strength was still above him, everyone could not help but start guessing, that is Richard’s legendary teacher, but Immediately, it was discovered that the female magician was a subordinate to Li. This made all the nobles' eyes to Richard immediately awe, even if the female magician was only a strong country, Richard also had the strength to establish the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Richard himself, there seems to be no exaggeration in the entire battle. However, the stone tower he stood in was once the center of the battlefield. The entire squadron's Nolander infantry took turns to attack the stone tower. However, Richard did a promise that he did not retreat before the battle flag. Just look at the thick corpses that piled up around the stone tower, and you can see how fierce the situation was at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the battlefield, the mother's nest is quietly swaying to save energy. Its huge body is still shrouded in thick, non-scattering fog, allowing people to see only a rough outline. The fog was now non-toxic, but the soldiers did not dare to get a little closer to the fog. They, according to Richard’s instructions, placed all the Nolande war dead soldiers’ bodies and placed them near the mother’s nest. The remains of the soldiers of Faro were transported to other places, most of which needed to be buried on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun is gradually sliding towards the sky, and the sky is half bright like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took the aristocrats who participated in the battle and boarded the top of the stone tower again. From here you can overlook the entire battlefield, and the battle flag embroidered with the emblem of the world of the volcano of the volcano is still flying. Standing on the edge of the stone tower, Richard pointed to the battlefield and said: "You are a heavy war. Please let us remember this scene." Remember that we once fought side by side in front of incomparably powerful enemies, and we shed blood and sacrifice together! I hope that from now on, we can become eternal allies, always standing in the same camp, not going against each other due to temporary interests. Don't abandon your promises because of greed for a while, and don't sell comrades because of the threat of the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are ashamed, they understand that this is the warning of Richard It is also his declaration, and it is their chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is finally over, ending with the intruder being completely smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the entire Faro, this is an epic war and has an epic ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undefeated military god of the Sequoia Kingdom, in an arduous battle, completely defeated the seemingly omnipotent ectopic army. He inserted the flag of war behind him. Before this flag, the feat of stepping back was spread all over the human kingdom and became the hero of the whole Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s previous brilliant achievements were also found out, including the annihilation of Sinclair’s battle at dusk, and finally got the name, the main credit from death. The Baron Fontaine returned to Richard here. So countless nobles were once again amazed, ladies and gentlemen talking and listening to the story of Richard at the big and small tea party, and then pretending to be shocked and lovely to attract the attention of young nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have discovered that Richard has already unknowingly eliminated two invaders with different faces. Especially in the recent past, the invaders are unusually powerful, not only defeating the powerful Baroque kingdom in an extremely unfavorable situation, but also destroying the powerful gods Ludreis in all high-order arms of the mortal church. power. In many countries, it is thought that the ecclesiasm army will drive straight into the country. Even when the distant countries begin to mobilize fully, the incursor’s journey is stopped in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
