			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom once again received talks after a meal, of course, educated The nobles will not directly laugh at the high-profile unicorn family's fuss, but countless metaphors and eyes flies, everyone is waiting for the elephant and ant confrontation with a mood to watch the latest opera. It’s not a win or lose that is concerned. This is beyond doubt, but it will take a long time for the great magician behind Richard to show up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also calm eyes watching this farce. Although the Duke of the Deep Rock City is not there, the frequency of visits by some powerful figures in the vassal does not decrease. Nearby and the Baron of Fontaine, and the border of Sir Richard, there is also an independent marquis and a number of viscounts and barons belonging to other lords. Some of them have begun to quietly strengthen their defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a joy in the castle at dusk. When the army of Sir Hogan arrived, the haze of the previous time was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most luxurious conference room of the castle, Sir Hogan, Count Latour, Sir Bubka, Great Wizard, Sonn, Bath, etc. The real powers sit around the table and discuss the next strategy. The little baron uncle is not qualified to enter this room, he is exactly the same as a errand. The little baron and the Baroness Baron in front were driven out of the dusk castle, in the name of asking them to go on holiday in the country, where the fresh air helped the little baron to thrive and calm the sadness of the Baroness Dan in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Count Latour has already introduced the terrain and armaments of the Richards territory, and has outlined a few important aspects of the known Richards. Latour didn't want to introduce it so easily, but the information about Richard's strongman was really pitiful, and most of them were obtained by the survivors of Baron Fontaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have information from Deep Rock City, but it seems to be as unreliable as the number of Viscounts and other released prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-headed silver-haired Sir Hogan was standing in front of the map, using the magic pen to hook out several important strongholds and choosing the route to enter. This is a mature plan, and it is being executed. The old jazz repeats it, mainly to let the magician and the priest know something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nobles are very troublesome, they don’t know how to fight, but if the plan does not let them know, they will be seriously dissatisfied. Because by convention, the great magician can choose the position on the battlefield. In addition to the large-scale strategic attack that must be carried out by the main force, the magical confrontation with the other magician is also determined autonomously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Sir Hogan, a curve was drawn from the Earl of the Deer to the Baron of Fontaine. "You, Sir Odom's army has been assembled, and is now waiting for the arrival of the fighting gods and the great magician. It is expected to arrive in ten days." Sir Hogan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!! When Sir Odom’s army arrives, we can give Richard an unforgettable lesson.” Sir Bubka said with a smile. Then he spread his hands and said, "I hope that our Sir Richard can build his majestic castle within ten days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly sounded There was a burst of laughter. Although it has been entangled in such a strong force, but the latecomers in the room are still very dissatisfied with the fuss that the owner is almost in the nest. The disappearance of the two squadron Eagles Knights was issued with the strictest ban. Except for the individual core figures, most people only know the record of the army of the Viscounts of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we want to give Richard a lesson first? At least give him some pressure." A great magician proposed. The 40-year-old great magician is very resentful of Richard, and the reason is naturally complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! During this time, we first need to defend ourselves. One is to strengthen the guards of the dusk castle, and the other is to protect the connection of the Earl. The road here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does Richard even dare to attack the troops of Sir Odom?" Another great magician said with a smile. He felt that he was telling a joke, but the Count of Latour and Sir Hogan, who was told that he was inside, did not laugh. This kind of thing, Richard can't do it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Hogan cleared his throat and ignored the jokes of the great wizard. He continued: "My idea is that the guards of the dusk castle are reduced to four hundred people." I will choose the strength of the force. But please ask all the great magicians and the gods to stay in the castle for the time being. I hope that Richard will attack the castle instead of the army of Odom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the conference room nodded their approval. With the defense of the dusk castle, although the number of guarded soldiers is less, there are enough magicians and priests to make Richard crash under the castle at dusk. Although no one thinks that Odom will be defeated, it is better to avoid this kind of thing in strange terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the conference room was lightly ringed. A young and handsome aristocratic officer walked into the conference room and gave a military ceremony to Sir Hogan. He said, "Adult! This is the intelligence that the reconnaissance cavalry has just sent back. A few days ago, Richard led his entire army and left. The territory, into the blood of the land, the current whereabouts are unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! All the army?" Hogan and Latour face change, and asked for confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer looks very nervous, but still insists: "Yes, the reconnaissance cavalry ventured into the territory of Richard and even saw the castle site. Now Richard There wasn’t a soldier on the territory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Latu slowly sat back in the chair, his face dignified and said: “He actually took all the troops away. I am not afraid of us..." This sentence is only half said and will not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be found on the territory of Richard? In addition to the stone, it is the wood, and there is a castle that has just dug the foundation. Can't you move a big dirt pit? As for the people and craftsmen, it is a valuable property. However, there are several people on the territory of Richard, that is, they are all brought back, and they are not enough for the army to replenish. What's more, this is against the laws of the kingdom. The people are the private property of the lord and are sacred and inviolable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any noble, especially the giants, will try their best to maintain and abide by the kingdom's laws concerning the territories and the people. Because this is the cornerstone of the aristocratic social order, and the most fundamental interests of every great aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do now?" Earl Latour looked to Sir Hogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." The old jazz said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the army of Sir Odom arrives, there will be more than 3,500 troops. The daily output of Baron Fontaine is not enough. The consumption of the army." Sir Latour said with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can let Xiaofang Dan contribute the savings of the Baron to the previous year! We are stationed here, after all, they are protecting them." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
