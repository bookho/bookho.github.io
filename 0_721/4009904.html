			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Faro plane has experienced multiple ectopic invasions In the end, everything will be safe. The recent two-dimensional intrusion, compared with history, is not significant. Now, it can only be regarded as a small whirlpool in the long history. The only significance is that it still exists. As for the future, no one can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolande as the main plane is never calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Faust in the night is still beautiful, but the mood of Gordon has nothing to do with beauty. Accompanied by two knights, he walked into the Eternal Dragon Hall and then met with the great god Vatican in the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of volcanic Gordon, Vatican looked helpless and said: "I am sorry, Lord Gotton. I can’t contact the sand now, though I don't want to admit it, but I have to say that Richard and the sands of their team are likely to have lost in the turbulence of time and space. If they are lucky, they may appear in an unknown plane."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin didn’t say how bad luck would be, but needless to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon stared at Vatican, and the depths of the eyes were all boiling lava, slowly saying: "We have offered such rare and precious sacrifices. The harvest is lost in time?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed and said: "The eternal and time dragon is very satisfied with the sacrifice and also gives corresponding The richness of God. But the will of God is not our mortal can guess, and the depths of the plane are endless mysteries. What we know is only a drop of water in the ocean. So, in the journey of time In the middle, what is happening is possible. You also know that in the past, the example of being lost in the depths of time is not uncommon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the sacrifices are different !" Gordon said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit, but there are many gods received by Richard. Moreover, the eternal and timeless dragon of the sacrifice day has come, so we The laws that have been known in the past are no longer valid, and what is happening is possible. The best way is to wait slowly." Fan Lin said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon is silent. He also knows that Vatican's words are correct. In the normal sacrifice, the Eternal Dragon Hall only has a little power left by the Dragon of Time to deal with sacrifice and grace. At that time, the body of the Dragon of Light was reduced, and the past laws were indeed broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon suddenly looked up and looked at Vatican and said in one sentence: "This incident is entirely accidental, is someone still involved?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin thought about it before answering: "I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't say..." Gordon sneered and said, "Okay, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked to the door and said to Vatican: "I am very Thanks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin smiles and says, "Many times, waiting is a wise choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gonton grinned and said: "But Archimonde's temper has always been anxious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning to the end, in the conversations between Gordon and Vatican, they did not delve into the issue of Richard and quicksand being alive or dead. They all deliberately avoided this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the famous white cliff to the east of the mainland of Calando, the girl with many braids is sitting on a large rock and watching the sun in the distance slowly. Into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Cliff is like its name, and the sea side is a straight and steep cliff, which is about a kilometer high. The cliff walls are made up of snow-white rocks. The top of the white cliff is a green grass. Looking far away, there is a dreamlike beauty. This is different from the conventional landform, which is a generous miracle that naturally gives life. It is one of the famous resorts of the entire Calando continent and a holy place for barbarian tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to tradition, every young warrior of the tribe will be selected by the holy temple for trial to determine whether there is a successor to the saint after he has enough power. Totem qualification. The White Cliff is one of the trial sites. Young candidates who want to prove their courage need to jump from the white cliff to the sea and climb back to the cliff top. If this process is completed, it will be recognized as the heir to the saint totem. Being able to be selected to participate in the White Cliff Trial will be regarded by each barbarian warrior as the highest glory in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the trial process is very dangerous, jumping from the high cliff to the sea, the impact will make the strong barbarian also vulnerable. Moreover, the total length of the white cliff is nearly 100 kilometers. The underwater waters are full of reefs. The young warriors need to choose the place to jump into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after entering the sea, most people are not able to climb back to the cliff top, but the fearless warriors will not give up, they will try to climb until the consumption Do the last bit of physical strength and fall back to the ocean. Before falling into the sea, the warriors will nail the teeth they wear into the white cliffs as proof of courage. The more the warriors who climb higher, the more they will be valued, and the more opportunities for inheriting the totem of the saints. As for the few people who successfully climbed back to the top of the cliff, they eventually became famous people in the history of barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl quietly looks into the distance, her beauty seems to blend into the landscape, and a few pale totem ribbons on her cheeks add to her many tribal styles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has mostly fallen into the sea, and after the golden color has completely converged, only the red of the sunset glows between the sea and the sky, shallow, dark red, and finally deep red, gradually The earth and the sky are like a color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassland on the white cliff is gradually dimmed, the wind begins to get bigger, and it also carries some chill. At the end of the long grass, an old man with a cane appeared. His movements seemed to be slow and weak, but in a blink of an eye he crossed a few kilometers and appeared behind the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, the elders are very worried about your current situation." The old man is the great sacrifice of the tribe's holy temple, Urazza, and the girl sitting at the beach is naturally Mountains and sea. After leaving Noland for several years, she seems to have no change except to grow taller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the elders know about my situation? He can't communicate with the beast." The mountain and the sea said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulazazu coughed a few times and said: "...I can communicate with the beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So little thing, is it necessary to communicate with the beast?" said the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice looked at the mountains and the sea with insight into the world, and shook his head and said, "Obviously, this is not a trivial matter."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl spit out a breath and said, "Maybe! But he is now just an outsider, but it tastes good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
