			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out a hot, turbid gas, like burning in the lungs The fire from the abyss. The depths of his body began to burst into emptiness and fatigue. Until then, the violent incitement caused by Akmon's bloodline came to an end, but the aftertaste remained for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a volcanic eruption, all the anger and wildness that converge into the lava’s heat and weight, when it rushes, it destroys the way forward. Everything is tangible and invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the anger of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was gasping for breathlessness, and his chest still echoed the urge to smash his opponent. In fact, he did the same, not a magician can use his continuous fireball to blow his opponent into ashes. Everyone has never seen such a confrontation, they have not even thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the blood of Archimonde has once again added a new ability, hot. The heat can increase the casting speed of Richard's spellless spells, so Richard can fire 13 fireballs in 11 seconds. This new bloodline is similar to the boiling of the sand, but it is far less powerful. However, compared with the boiling that can be used once in seven days, the hot can be launched once a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the heat wave in front of him dissipated, Richard’s heart was still stirring. When violence is pushed to the extreme, it becomes art, and it has the appeal of art that shocks the soul. The thrill of the ruin is what Richard never experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Blood brings the enhancement of summoning magic, representing calmness, elegance and control. And Archimonde's blood is to strengthen the power of the damage magic, and it will become simple and rude. This is the two sides of a coin, two extremes that cannot meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly recovered from the violent temper, quietly issued a siege command in consciousness, and took out a bottle of magic to restore the potion, one bite Drink dry. At the same time, the magical energy of the sand drifting also falls on him. The powerful magic recovery agent plus the energy from the magic and the structure can speed up the recovery of Richard's magic five times, in less than a few minutes, Richard There will be magic that can release three or four fireballs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the red Cossacks were still shocked by the scene, until the Sandman cavalry and the barbarian forces approached, and they waved their arms in a panic to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunderous thunder on the battlefield, and the eardrums were a little bitter, and the momentum was even louder than the fireball that had just exploded! A group of blue smog soared into the sky, but the place where the smoke was born was blocked by the truck, and it was impossible to see what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the relationship between the two ordinary teeth in the consciousness of Richard suddenly disappeared. The two winds were leading a team of Shamin cavalry to cover the red Cossack caravan. They received an order from Richard's siege and they just started charging. When Li’s heart sank, he quickly jumped on the horse’s back and looked at it. He saw that the 50 sandmen’s cavalrymen who followed the two winds and launched their attacks were falling into the horse, and they burst into a blood flower from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the fifty-seat sandman cavalry is half lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha almost suspected that they had been attacked by two teams of throwing soldiers. Otherwise, how could he let half of the sandmen ride in the horse in an instant? The attackers must have been in the place where the smoke was rising, but the trucks that were connected together as temporary fortifications still blocked Richard's line of sight, making him unable to see the images behind the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard immediately ordered the frontal fighters to accelerate, while the powerful followers joined the battle, and he himself commanded two elite bats to fly into the sky to see what happened after the truck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the elite bat passed back surprised Richard. After a few trucks, standing in a row of about 50 dwarves, they flatted a strangely shaped musket, aiming at the sandman knight who rushed out dozens of meters away, and triggered the trigger again! Then, as the horn-like opening of the muzzle, the big-lead lead sand was sprayed, and if there was a dark cloud, the sand-carrying cavalry flew toward the assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless tiny blood flowers that bloom again on the sandmen’s cavalry. One by one, the cavalry is stunned, but they can no longer control their bodies. come down. Obviously they have never encountered such weapons, and they do not know how to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if someone uses the method of avoiding the bow and shoots, flexibly curling up on the horse's back, or hanging to the side of the horse, it still fails to complete Avoid attacks that are impossible to judge the trajectory. The smell of smoke and the violent explosion of gunpowder also made many horses almost out of control on the way to Mercedes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full set of 50 sandmen cavalry, and a relatively small number of dwarves, but after the other two rounds of shooting, only less than ten rides! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf muskets each carried two long guns and two short guns. After the rifle was shot, the dwarfs immediately and skillfully pulled out the short guns, one by one. Both were hand-held guns, followed by a dense barrage covering the surviving sandmen cavalry. The last sandman cavalry crashed into the ground, and the huge inertia caused his body to slide on the ground, dragging a trace of redness, and sliding until the dwarf fireman three meters stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is only three meters, but he has no strength to cross this last distance. A slamming sound, the dwarf iron-clad leather boots kicked heavily on the head of the Shamin Cavalry and sent him to the final journey of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf Fireman!" Richard cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no time to think about how these dwarves came out, immediately ordered the frontal forces to speed up the attack, while the right side of the Shaman cavalry also attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Dwarf Fireman is huge and the weakness is obvious. For example, their gun loading speed is obviously slow, and now all four guns have been fired, which is the most vulnerable moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp scream in the air, and four elite bats rushed into the air, rushing into the queue of the Dwarf Fireman, constantly biting with a highly poisonous minion. . Then a black warrior appeared again in the dwarf queue. The advantage of summoning magic farther than the magic spell casting spell is completely revealed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the front line, Gangde also activated the power of the earth and the power of the building, the hunger and thirst axe swayed like a wind, and the full force of the erect Will make his heavy body off the ground! Every time he squats, he will bring the knights in front of him to two. The ogre was even more fierce. He simply slammed into the cavalry that blocked the road. Under the violent force, the Cossack cavalry even flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rushed side by side, quickly making a gap in the Cossack queue, and then rushing to the van. Gangde’s giant axe and the ogre’s hammer almost slammed into a truck in front of him at the same time. The bang was smashed and the ore loaded inside was splashing. Under the urging of Richard, Gangde and the ogre did not have time to detour, but chose the most violent and direct way to destroy obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
