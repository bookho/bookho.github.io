			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low personal strength is always a hard hit by Essien. If you want to influence history, at least the pope of the god of courage, there will be a little bit of possibility. The pope of the god of courage is generally served by the 18th-level grand priest. The cardinal gods are generally at the level of seventeen, with a minimum of sixteen. If a seventeen-level grand priest became a pope, he might barely press the cardinal, and the 16th level would not think about it. Richard, who had a battle with Essien, understood that he needed some luck in his life to think of the fifteenth level. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, Essien secretly studied the face and time knowledge of the taboos of the temple, and the god of courage that was acquired must be damaged. Progress on the road will be more difficult. So the fate is destined, this Essin who snoops into the fog of the endless plane can only be a small person who silently disappeared into history. He used this diary with a magic lock to record his real thoughts, but he also saw his future ending. On a certain day in the future, perhaps at the time of death, Essien will start the self-destruction of the magic lock, so that this diary, which has been recorded for a lifetime, will always accompany himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the accident happened. Essien didn’t even think that Richard would be crazy and bold enough to go deep into the baron of the hinterland and sneak into the temple of the god of courage. This diary It fell in the hands of Richard. Moreover, Richard is still a builder, a very solid foundation builder, and it is easy to break the magic lock that has no solution at all when Faro claims to have no spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last part of the diary, Richard unexpectedly discovered the origin of the piece of the page. This piece of debris belongs to the ectopic face artifact, which is found by a team of adventurers from an unknown time storm ruin. It is one of the pages of The Book of Hosting. According to Essien, the book bearing the book has a total of nine pages. If you find a total of nine pages, you can synthesize the real book of Hosting. It is said that when two pieces of broken pages are put together, there will be a unique ability to carry the book. After every two pages, a new ability will be added. And the complete "Book of Hosting" has any effect, even Essien does not know. After all, counting the piece of the page that is now in the hands of Richard, the Church of Courage has only collected two pages of the book "The Book of Hosting". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of page will only appear occasionally in the storm of time. As for where it comes from, who it belongs to, why it is damaged, what kind of existence is created It is completely unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the role of this residual page in Richard’s hand is to store a magic of no more than six orders, and the storage time is one month. The residual page can be used repeatedly. The effect of a single piece of residual page is not too great. At least two pieces are in hand, and the ability to "bear the book" is activated to show power. However, for Richard, who is about to be promoted to the Nine-level Master at this stage, the single-page residual page is already a very practical magical device, which is equivalent to double the number of his highest-level magic, and the overall attack power is improved. At least one third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day after the Essien Magic Diary was cracked, Richard officially became a 9th-level magician. After repeated thoughts, he finally selected his first five-level magic, naturally summoned. Natural Summon is a magic that can be raised to the ninth level, but the creatures summoned will be different for each level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this magic, Richard only spent a little half a day practicing the skill, and then took out the residual pages of the book "bearing books" to study. Unlike the principle of making ordinary magic scrolls, its magic storage is not achieved by writing. The residual pages are more like a container that directly stores energy. In the heart of Richard's heart, I remembered that some of the intelligent races recorded in the Dark Blue Library had no words, but recorded and passed on in the form of patterns, symbols, and even spiritual marks. From Essien's diary, this piece of debris can completely preserve and store magical energy, perhaps the way in which it created the race to inherit civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying for a while, Richard decided to experiment, hand pressing on the residual page and starting to release the newly learned five-level magic. In the meticulous chanting of the chanting, he suddenly felt the blood of the elf hidden in the body leaping slightly, and then the heat of the animal tooth necklace on the wrist, a two-power force converge in the body of Richard. In the magic, the fifth-order natural call is finally formed. The magic light flashed in the palm of Richard, and did not spread out, directly enclosed in the pages of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the original page of the blank, there are already a few fierce wolves that are lifelike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent wolf, like the violent wild boar, has thick scales on the shoulders and back waist to increase defense, but the fierce wolf is more aggressive than the violent wild boar. Strong, the improvement of combat power is also more obvious. The fierce wolf on the residual page of "The Book of Hosting" is very powerful only when it looks at the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard felt a little wrong. He picked up the pages and carefully counted the number of fierce wolves. Five heads, yes, five fierce wolves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of magic creatures originally summoned naturally is between one and three heads, but in the hands of Richard with precise talent, whether it is spells, gestures, and magical movements There will be almost no mistakes, so each time it will steadily reach the upper limit of three summons, plus the increase of the Elven Blood and the Beast Bracelet, which is four heads. However, after the promotion, the number of magic creatures summoned was actually one more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully listened back to the previous casting process in his mind, judging that the induction of the blood of the elf was further increased. The combat power of a fierce wolf is basically the same as that of a powerful, powerful beast. If this is the case, then the most powerful magic in the fifth order becomes a natural call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the Elven Blood and the Tooth Necklace will have the same effect on other summoning spells, if possible, for the enhancement of high-level magic. The effect can almost be described as against the sky. Don't say anything else, summon the demon's door to the outside world, summon the dragon's dragon blood call of Yalong and other dragons, summon the call of the iron scorpion, all of which are high-level powerful summoning magic, but the magical creature power that comes from the covenant Too powerful, even if you don't consider the failure rate, you can only summon one at a time. If there is a bonus, then the absolute power of this magic is the growth of multiples. But whether it is effective or not, Richard must at least rise to the 13th level to get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current level, only the undead summoned, and Richard couldn’t help but rush, and immediately experimented, but unfortunately, magical light After the flash, only three white bones jumped around the room without any bonus effect. Explain that the Elven Blood and the Beast Bracelet have no effect on the undead creature call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally calmed down and snapped a finger to dispel the magic. Even if it only has a bonus effect on the natural call, it is enough. He sat down again and looked at the five fierce wolves on the broken pages, which inevitably revealed a bit of self-satisfaction and joy. In particular, Gordon once said that Su Hailun's blood ability is the summoning master, and he is more looking forward to showing this magic to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summoning five fierce wolves at a time, is the teacher at his current level, and it is difficult to do better? Even with the bonus of blood, you should be the most violent wolf. Richard could not help but think that if the teacher saw his achievements today, would there be many ‘Su Hailun’s joy’? I don't know why, the night of fate suddenly broke into his mind. The deep blue sigh that is so beautiful as a true dream seems to be heavy and dancing in the void, with the teacher's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
