			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Richard has already learned about the blue water oasis, so When camping outside the city, he told everyone to keep the camp, and he entered the city with a few followers. This time in the Blue Water Oasis, Richard is ready to sell a few more magical fabrics in exchange for the magic materials needed, and initially set up a unit of his own. Although his current strength is not bad, at least the face of the thieves group of less than 100 will basically win. But Richard did not put his goal on the Little Thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the city, it is already at night. Richard first found the best hotel in the city to open the best room. After dinner, he took everyone to find a large-scale bar and was ready to inquire about the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is still a little early, the number of guests in the bar is not too much. A slightly older person behind the bar was wiping the cup. He is very thin, has a very flexible eye, and the pupil is full of cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the bar, Richard looked around at everyone in the bar and then gave a general impression of their strength. Richard asked his men to find a large table to sit down, and they sat directly at the bar, took out a gold coin, and slid on the smooth bar to the bartender, saying: "The people who give me have a glass of wine, the best here. That kind of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The bartender skillfully took the gold coins, then took out a few cups and put them on the bar. Each cup was filled with a golden liquid, and the strong fragrance suddenly came out, then he turned to the back. After a snap, I immediately drilled out a few waitresses who were exposed to almost naked, and brought the wine to the table where Richard followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are two women in the entourage, they seem to have no resistance to the spirits, but they drink it in a toast, more than the men in the room. be quick. In the land of blood, if there is something famous, then wine must be one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also took a cup, took a shallow drink, could not help but brighten his eyes and said: "Good wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course. You are new here, we have the old rules, the first half of the price per night, there is no discount in the back." The bartender said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "It doesn't matter, give everyone another cup." During the talk, two brilliant gold coins slid along the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender skillfully poured the wine. When Richard looked down on wine tasting, the bartender just turned his side and looked at him carefully and quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then pulled out a small purse and slid to the bartender, then said: "Here is twenty gold coins, the temple gold coin. About the red Cossack, What do you know about it? Especially with regard to the rumors about Red Hook, I am more interested. Tell me what you know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Cossack? The bartender took the money bag and put it in the counter. Then he said, "Well, you will wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender takes a little bigger The cup, then reached out and took a dissatisfied brown bottle from the top of the wine rack, poured out a large half of the scarlet spirits, a finger, and slipped into front of Richard, with a playful smile said: "Red Cossacks are coming. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's eyebrows were slightly wrinkled and he reached for the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, please pay now, a total of three hundred temple gold coins! My rules here, once the wine is delivered, will not be returned!" Arm, squinting at Richard, said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled indifferently and said, "Do you dare to black my money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bakery The narrow eyes sighed and said: "There are no long-haired boys, who want to drink alcohol here? Nor is he/mother/what is the place here! Nigga!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few corners of the corner sitting on the table screamed, one of them nearly two meters high, and the head was about to hit the magic light hanging from the ceiling. This is a dark-skinned man, ** upper body, painted with a pale paint on his chest. In Richard's perception, the pale gimmicks emit a strange wave of swaying, which seems to be a totem of some kind of tribal myth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tenth-level warrior, and obviously has some special talents in strength, which can be seen from the body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These big men came to the bar, the bartender pointed at Richard and sneered and said: "This kid doesn't know the rules, actually wants to buy news from me directly! However, his gold coins are quite a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man nodded, constantly kneading his fists, and the knuckles made a squeaky sound, saying : "The little hybrid that is hairless, leave all the money, plus your right hand, and then bring it to you with your people! If you dare say no, leave your hands and feet!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want my right hand?" Richard's smile has begun to ooze chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate bargaining! Now add your left hand!" The nigga screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the glass and keeps shaking, the scarlet liquor swirls in the cup, his eyes fall in the glass, not seeing Looking at the bartender and the nigger, just faintly said: "Which dog eyes you saw are good bullying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ghost is furious, Roaring: "Now you don't want to go! Climb is not!" The voice has not fallen, his huge fist has been with the evil wind, slamming into Richard's face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looked at the wine in the cup, and although his hair had been stirred up by the wind, he didn’t notice anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nigga’s fist suddenly stopped in the air when he was less than half a meter from Richard’s forehead. A steel-claw-like hand held the nigga's wrist, which made this powerful punch impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde did not know when he stood by Richard and shot the nigga. Gangde’s body is smaller than the nigga, but the horror and murderousness in his body is stronger than the nigga. The black ghost's hand must have been stained with a lot of blood, but where is the bloody horror of the death camp? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on the chest of the black ghost's chest are swollen and his face is black and red, but he is forced to use his strength and his fists can no longer advance. Gangde is like a statue of steel casting, completely unable to shake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde screamed at the nigga, revealing the white teeth, the muscles on his arms began to squirm, and the body suddenly burst into two different breaths. Then the black ghost suddenly screamed, showing the painful color, and the arm bones that were held were also squeaking. His fist was involuntarily pulled up, and then the arm was pulled into a very unnatural angle. Finally, the nigga finally couldn't stand the pain, wailing, knees and landing, and was suppressed to the front of Gangde! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
