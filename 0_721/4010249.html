			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha actually meditated for five days in the tree of life! But the harvest of this meditation was huge. When Richard scrutinized his magic, he suddenly had a surprise. His magical power suddenly spanned more than half of the level, reaching the 1900 standard magic, which was very close to the fifteenth level. In the past five days, Richard’s average daily magic has increased by nearly a hundred, which is a dozen times the speed of ordinary magicians! Compared with Richard's original magical speed, it has also increased by six or seven times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real image of the elemental world tree brings a basic bloodline ability to Richard: elemental increase. But when he uses all the power or magic that needs to call the power of the elements in the future, the power will increase slightly, roughly 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the original elemental growth ability combined with Richard’s real name of destruction, the difference became elemental destruction. From now on, all the magical powers of the elements released by Richard will increase by about 15%, and the attributes of the Abyss Prisonfire will be added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that when Richard spends less than a month and raises the magic to fifteenth level, he can cast a powerful eight-level magic. His combat power will advance by leaps and bounds and enter a new realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and took a slightly stiff body before he began to think about this extraordinary meditation. Obviously, the rich and near-substantial life will never be a product of nature, and most of it is related to the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently patted the natural wall formed by the trunk of the tree of life in the tree house, just wanting to call Zhu Bu Ling Feng, and then communicate with the tree of life . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there are countless green spots floating around the tree of life, flying around Richard, and then the sound of the tree of life is in the consciousness of Richard. It sounded: "Visitors of different faces, we can communicate directly now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the tree of life sounded, Richard only felt his head sinking slightly. This is caused by the excessive pressure of the will of the soul to bear the tree of life. But it is also limited to feeling a little heavy, just like not sleeping well last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life immediately said with surprise: "Your soul is so powerful that I am shocked! I really don't know how to describe it, but from now on, we should be between You can communicate without any obstacles, great ectopic visitors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What was the life of my life when I was meditating?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would have spilled excess life to prevent natural progression. Those breaths of life can be absorbed by any life, making them More powerful. Obviously your ability does not exclude the energy of this attribute, so you can also absorb it. Just to improve the utilization, so when you meditate, I concentrate all the life that comes out of your surroundings. However, the speed you absorb is too fast, I am somewhat unsustainable, and I have to use a little of my own source strength to maintain the richness of life around you." Life Tree said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much power do you need to consume like meditation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Tree is silent I calculated it and said, "If it is the speed of the previous acquisition, I will feel tired after a long time, thus slowing down the release of life in the future. For example, in the next two months, the life that I will release will be Halve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doing this doesn't seem to be good for you, it just helps me." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life actually laughed like a human, saying: "How is it no good? The main purpose of my life is to strengthen the guardian spirit and upgrade them as soon as possible. The strength. When they have enough strength to repel my natural enemies, I will be able to grow the ranks. Now, you and your army have replaced the elves and become my most powerful guardian. In this sense Say, improving your strength is the biggest benefit I get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clever tree of life, smart enough to pass, but let Richard There was a slight uneasiness, and there was some suspicion about the magical restraint effect of the flow sand. In addition, he does not like the feeling of being unable to control, such as the pleasure of indulging in boundless power, such as entering deep meditation without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time in Archimonde's cemetery, although the intense power was particularly hot and violent, it gave him a familiar feeling. This time, the power of life is so rich and pure, it should be comfortable, but he has a dangerous feeling. Moreover, the concentration of life tree released by the tree of life is especially important for the elves attached to it. Halving is already the bottom line. Below this value, the elf will begin to appear sick, weak and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tree of life continues: "In addition, I feel that you have a strange talent, able to perfectly blend the life that I have released, than I have. Any elves you've ever met must fit in. Even the mighty son of the forest is just that. So meditating around me can be a great help to your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard is temporarily pressing his distracting thoughts and thinking carefully, indeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation of the base city, he perceives the breath of life in the form of a life vortex, which is not only an order of magnitude less energy, but also difficult to capture and absorb. . The life of life tree is almost actively attached to his spiritual strength and pulled back into the body. No matter the quality or quantity, it is far better than the base city. And Richard faintly feels that he can absorb the breath of life so quickly and effectively, and can communicate directly with the tree of life, I am afraid that it is closely related to the blood of his elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, the value of the tree of life has far exceeded a broken tree heart. At least until it had a substantial rebellious move, Richard was not prepared to take its tree to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you still maintain the concentration of life just now?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, it only takes longer to rest afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said: "Well, we continue, this time will take about five days." The trade-off between advantages and disadvantages only stayed in his mind for a few seconds. In any case, the improvement of power is real. Now that he has realized that there are some places in the deep meditation state that make him uneasy, he has the confidence to control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the tree house, and the soldiers who had called the guards simply confessed a few words, and then locked themselves in the tree house to continue meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the surround of life, Richard’s magic is rapidly increasing. On the fifth day, he finally broke through the fifteenth level! At the fifteenth level, placed in Noland, it can be called a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was not in a hurry to leave the tree house, but to pass the known eight levels of magic one by one in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Pamir once cast, there is an extra bonus thundercloud storm in the Greenson plane; there is a withering effect of both powerful damage and immediate death; there is also a spiritual barrier equivalent to the guardian spirit of the gods; natural summons can be summoned Tyrannosaurus, and the alien spell can capture a powerful alien creature to temporarily fight for the magician. The fire cloud and the thundercloud storm have similar effects, but the flames are burned by the flames burning for a long time, and the bursting of the sun is the nemesis of the undead and shadow creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a special eight-level magic that makes Richard hesitate, that is, the shadow call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic system, this magic also belongs to the summoning magic, which can summon a powerful shadow creature to fight for the magician. Shadow summons, alien spells, and natural summons summon creatures with different characteristics, and mature wizards will be flexible according to the characteristics of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard knows his own problems, and there are countless shadow creatures who regard themselves as a beacon in the turbulent time, if they take the initiative to cast shadow calls, Is it equivalent to lighting up the torch on the lighthouse? Will there be a summoned one at that time, or is it a group of shadow creatures? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, before thoroughly understanding the characteristics of the shadow creature, Richard is ready to seal the magic into the cold, never use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the tree house, he accidentally discovered that the sand was standing on a platform, and the green elves gathered around her explained The deeds and teachings of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves listened attentively, and many elf faces even had a yearning for them, full of curiosity and desire for the beautiful world described by the flowing sand. They never knew what the sun was, nor the concept of dryness and warmth. The grasslands in the mountains and the mountains were completely beyond their imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest of the Green Forest, there is no concept of grass at all, only a small piece of grass is formed around the tree of life. And there is where the elves like to stay. When they heard the grass, they could see it all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the elves and couldn’t help but think. It seems that life's pursuit of good things is common, but the standards of good things will be different. Generally speaking, the less something, the more precious it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Liu Sha stood up and said to the elves: "Okay! I will talk about it today, I will leave now. You can According to the method I taught you, try to believe and communicate with the dragon of eternal and time, which is not contradictory to your dependence on the tree of life. When I come back next time, I can know who is the most devout believer. I will choose the three most devout believers, take them across the time and space, and reach the beautiful new world that should only exist in the dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The elves below cheered for a while! Later, they looked at the sand and Li, and they were all reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tree house that is far from the platform, the elder elders and Zhu Bu. Ling Feng saw this scene, relatively silent. After a while, the elder elders sighed heavily and left the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder, can we let these invaders corrupt the souls of the people?" The young Druid deliberately lowered his voice, but it was difficult to hide it. The hatred that is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders’ attitude is very calm. He walked back and forth in the same place. After a while, he said, “You feel that our tradition, our consistent belief, Is it necessarily correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
