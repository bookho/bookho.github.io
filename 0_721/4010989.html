			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so powerful, and he is not willing to face hundreds of fighters and thousands of unknown enemies at this time. He suddenly flashed into the army of flesh-and-blood warriors, flying swords like flying, and several flesh-and-blood warriors skillfully cut into dozens of pieces, and then all swept into the space bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing this, Li’s body appeared three faces in the week, aiming at the base is a sweeping fireball bombardment, and then avoiding hundreds of meters with an instant movement. outer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no stop for Richard, and after the attack from the Reaper base, he began to transmit in every bit of kilometers and was ready to withdraw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reapers are chasing after the end, and they continue to send fighters in front to intercept. However, in the case of Richard’s intention to run, the small fighter alone could not leave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to leave the area under the Reaper’s rule, Richard’s heart suddenly burst into a dangerous feeling. He quickly turned his head and looked north. He immediately saw a huge warship nearly 100 meters long appeared in the sky and was coming at a high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of kilometers between the two sides, and the battleship began to attack the light beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its firing rate is not fast, and Richard moved a little, letting its attack fall through. But the two high-energy beams, as thick as the arms, still let Richard know. The emergence of medium-sized warships allowed Richard to sneak a dangerous sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of this trip is already rich enough, so Richard is no longer in love, reaching out to outline the portal in the air, then sending it to hundreds of kilometers away, leaving The scope of the reaper's sphere of influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the snow, the messenger rises up and carries Richard along the way. But Richard’s heart was at a glance, and looking back, the medium-sized warship actually chased it again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger began to force out, but the speed of 700 kilometers can only slowly pull away and pursue the distance. Fortunately, not long after, a new messenger appeared in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beautiful streamlined creature with a length of nearly 20 meters. The slender body is lined with bright yellow patterns. It has several natural depressions on its back, and the size is enough to make people sit in. Richard immediately flashed into one of the depressions and sat down. The new messenger has a transparent mask on the back to protect Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the new messenger turned around, all the bright yellow stripes on the body were lit, and then the long tail shocked, and the speed of more than 900 kilometers was gone, leaving the reaper's medium-sized warship behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the reaper has been completely abandoned, Richard asked the messenger to turn to the turbulent land. The speed of this new type of messenger has dropped to seven hundred kilometers, and then it flies at a constant speed. Every time the long tail swings, it will swim for ten kilometers. Richard, sitting in the depression, barely felt the shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Richard went to the turbulent land and came to the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the wreckage of the reapers in the space ring and threw them in front of the mother's nest, saying, "Try to analyze their composition and structure." See if you can find out what weaknesses are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest opening device sucks all the wreckage of the ground into the abdomen. The metal skeletons of those flesh-and-blood warriors were cut off by Richard, but the flesh and blood parts remained almost intact. When they were taken out of the space bracelet, they were still squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei has left a relatively complete part and prepared to analyze it slowly. Then, Richard reached out and took a huge mountain nest and asked: "You also see the reaper, what is the idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest said : "Master, the reaper is not invincible, but now our strength is still insufficient. In addition, the various combat units you designed before have to worry about the human perception, so they can not play the best combat. I need to redesign the new Fighting units, but it takes time to produce them. In addition, it takes time to analyze the reapers. Only by analyzing the rules they use can I design more specific units."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and gave a sigh of relief, saying: "The next war will be very difficult. But I will continue to fight until I completely defeat the Reaper, or the Reaper. Defeat! The Brood, you are actually inseparable from Faro, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" The mother's nest is the same voice. Bringing surprises at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "I was thinking about how to take the three goddesses away from Faro. You are now equivalent to Faro. A special god, a god that can exist without relying on any rules, but only relying on the strength of the plane. But it also makes you and Faro firmly tied together. The three goddesses give up the throne and can leave. And you can't live without it, unless one day, your strength is strong enough to control the extent of the plane. How many levels should you be at that time? Fifteen, or sixteen?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sixteen, master." The nest gave the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, look, you already know it yourself. When I think of it, you will give me a fake egg and tell me that you will be born again from here." If I really withdraw, would you rely on the resources of the entire Faro and the Reaper to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't win, if you only have your own words. But I don't understand why you lie to me? It doesn't make much sense to lie on this matter." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest said: "Master, with your character, I am worried that after telling you, you will refuse to give up Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am like a irrational person?" Richard yelled loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have always been." The mother's nest does not know what is euphemism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helpless and had to sigh and said, "But you should at least tell me that the avatar in Green Forest is no longer you. It is already A completely independent individual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you say this, will you let you stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Richard waved his hand and said: "Oh! Don't say this, anyway, I am sure! You can quickly analyze the information of the Reaper! Ah, yes, the Reaper has a wonderful Fluctuation, they use this kind of fluctuation to explore the living body. Your combat unit should be discovered like this. I will pass it on to you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment of data transfer, Richard convened a new type of messenger and said, "I am leaving!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger rises into the sky, the turbulent land The scenery quickly becomes smaller and farther away. At this time, the voice of the mother's nest suddenly sounded in consciousness: "Master, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardha smiled and said, "Thank you! I am playing this. The war is not for you... at least not all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard went away, the mother’s nest whispered in a slightly undetectable voice. : "One point is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not notice the whisper of the mother's nest, and his mind had all been placed on the war with the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Iron Triangle Empire, Salenville is busy re-mobilizing and reorganizing the Imperial League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that even the first-level corps of the empire has only been massacred in the battle with the Reaper, only to reach the level of the most elite army in the Crimson Kingdom. That is, the average level of 10 or above, the ability to fight the reaper. So Salenwell pulled out the most elite units of all the regiments and prepared to reorganize an independent legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he reviewed the adaptation plan, an elite knight came into the room and said, "His Royal Highness wants to talk to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville followed the elite squadron knight to the war room, where several mages are following the commands that have just been passed to adjust the magic map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new magic map, with the deep red king as the center, was drawn three lines of defense. This is the latest adjustment of Richard's deployment, but even the most peripheral defense line, it is significantly smaller than the original defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarranville’s face is extremely ugly. According to the new line of defense, it means that there are more than a dozen cities, and tens of millions of people have been abandoned. What kind of end is in the hands of the Reaper, and Saranwell has seen it with his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should you contract so much!" Salenwell whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard came from the mouth of the elite squadron: "Because I can’t hold it! The outermost two lines of defense, I guess it won’t take long. It will be broken. We can only stop the Reaper in the innermost area! The defense will expand too far and will only be broken faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With a bang, Saranwell slammed the table heavily and said: "But do you know what it means? This means throwing another 10 million people to the reaper!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Richard's voice was cold and calm, "but if the line of defense can't keep it, this million people will still die, and there will be more possibilities." Those who live will die because of our stupid decisions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
