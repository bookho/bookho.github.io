			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was not angry and rejoicing, he took a heavy sip and slammed the holy sword and said loudly: "This group of reapers will not do it! They are now Only ten teams can be dispatched, the next time is six, and the next time... Next time, we will attack their nest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, next time you may hang up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, hurry and sleep for another five minutes!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm of Richard is in exchange for some ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is able to respond to him with only a few strong ones. The battle units of the Brood are the first to consume in the war. There is not much left at the moment. The battle with the Reapers continues until now, and all the powerful who are still alive are not known how many times Richard was born and died. The relationship between the two sides has long ceased to be a simple lord and follower, but more like a brother of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes of sleep is already a luxury for Richard. He always starts in battle and ends with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save his comrades in battle, Richard used his own body to block the attack of the Reaper. Richard's body is tough, but any strong person knows that every time he heals a serious injury, it consumes vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard stalked the Holy Sword and said loudly: "All are up, we are now returning to the king to replenish the supplies, and then go to the reapers to go to hell. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned the stars and messengers to come over, watching the strong people rush to the stars and messengers, and then set foot on their own special super high speed The messenger flew to the king at a speed of more than a thousand kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This replenishment may be the most important supply before the end of the Reaper, because the latest Thunder God developed by Black Gold has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Raytheon is no longer a six-tube, but a parallel double-tube. Although the rate of fire has decreased, the range and accuracy have increased significantly. At the same time, the complicated power spin system has been reduced. The difficulty and time of manufacture have dropped drastically, and the output has tripled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important innovation of this Raytheon is the bullet. It fires a special metal projectile that is actually loaded with the reaper's power metal. This kind of projectile is very powerful, and if you hit it directly, you can bomb the reaper's small fighter! Even a medium-sized fighter can’t be a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Raytheon has no meaning in the war. Richard has mobilized hundreds of knights, and hundreds of night elves are waiting to change. The mother's nest is more crisp, and it simply creates a special organ that can load the new Raytheon for a group of newly-created insect-type flying warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard returned to Wangdu, the first thing was to bring a new Raytheon and examine the actual results. This is a huge weapon that is nearly two meters long, and it is rough but extremely durable. The two huge barrels are particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the magic experimenter and ordered several humanoid targets of the sacred domain to be placed 100 meters away. Then lifted Raytheon to aim at one of them and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two loud roars, the humanoid target first deformed in a violent explosion, and then was smashed by the second bullet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee puts down Raytheon and is very satisfied with its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy shoots once and can even hit a medium-sized fighter. The power is enough. The only fly in the ointment is that its recoil is too big. Richard estimates that soldiers below the fifteenth level cannot use Raytheon at all. It is the construction of the knight, and you must rest after a few shots. Otherwise, most of them will be injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a minor problem, and the appearance of the double-barrel Raytheon is a powerful complement to the throwing spear for the knight. Its power is indeed slightly inferior to throwing a spear, but don't forget that Raytheon does not consume vindictiveness. The knights will use the spear and the thunder to alternate, and the combat power can be increased by at least half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very satisfied and said to the military supervisor next to him: "Replace the troops immediately and tell them that they have half a day to get familiar with these new guys. Oh, Some of the projectiles are, let them experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the military supervisors have a hard time, saying: "Sorry, Your Highness, the number of Raytheons shipped this time is far from enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough? Black Gold said he sent over 600 new Raytheons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we only received one hundred, and the projectile was only one-third of the scheduled number. It is said that the rest of the accident occurred on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Accident?” Li’s mouth sneaked on a cold sneer and said slowly: “Interesting, unexpected! At this time, someone really dared to create an accident for me! Come with me and tell me everything! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, outside a old and elegant castle, a young nobleman is playing a new thunder. He aimed at a humanoid target a hundred meters away and tried to buckle the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the gun was slightly biased, but the violent explosion completely bombed the humanoid target from the ground. The thunderous roar shocked the young aristocrats, and he calmed down, looked at the thunder in his hand, and aimed at the next target. The gun hit it directly, and the humanoid target was blown into fly ash on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s complex face, sighed: “I didn’t expect the Archimonde family to have developed such a weapon! The power of this thing is so big that it can be bombarded. Killing the knights. Sure enough, war is the mother of human progress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An older mage next to him is somewhat worried: "Young, we Is it a little risky?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Adventure? How come!” The young nobleman chuckled and said, “It’s just a little temptation. Look at the reaction of Archimonde. Their reaction is too intense or too mild, which means that the rumors are true, that is, their strength has been greatly weakened in the war, and it is even possible to lose the war with the Reaper. Even if Richard wants to trace, the rush between the rushes is only the few ghosts that have been launched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reveals a complacent smile," Even if he found us on the head, what can he do? At most, we are still going out. The new ...... oh, this thing called Raytheon. At most, I will give him a part of Raytheon. I am the nephew of His Royal Highness, and now he is presiding over the offensive of the entire dusk, and has successfully laid a new army fortress. In this case, I don't think Richard is willing to do anything! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidence of the young aristocrats was not contaminated by the old Master. He was still worried and said: "But these Raytheons are obviously against the next war of Archimonde." Great, I see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man interrupted him and said, "If this is the case, then I can't even give them these things. Do you still want Archimonde to win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master sighed and knew that it would be useless to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people ask: "Right, how is the result of the research? This thing seems to be simple to manufacture, can we copy it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master shook his head and said: "It has encryption on the triggering array, but this can also be solved slowly, or replaced by a self-designed array. But most of its power comes from special projectiles, which contain a special kind of metal, which is probably the power metal that Archimond grabs from the reaper. There is no power metal in our hands, copying The power of the projectile is only one-third of the original."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face flashed undisguised disappointment: “One third? Then we want it to What is the use, the ammunition is not the scrap iron? Wait, Archimonde should be the power of the metal to the dark blue, you go check! See when Archimonde sent to the dark blue caravans, Which of them carries the power metal, we will rob another team back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "This...Yes! Young Master!" The old Master reluctantly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard returned to the floating island, he learned enough information in less than an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is a bit complicated, but it is absolutely impossible to see the gray lines of the entire Noland. Archimonde’s heavy money spilled, and the information immediately flew like a snow flake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the turbidity stream heard that after Richard had returned, he also quietly came to the floating island, and Licha secretly for half an hour. When the turbidity flowed away, Richard had a clear outline of the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident started from an insignificant little Viscount near Ashan, who forcibly intercepted the Archonde cargo team passing through his territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cargo fleet happens to ship the first batch of new Raytheon. The two sides had a conflict and each of them had killed hundreds of soldiers. The final cargo team had to be inspected, and during the inspection, most of the Raytheon was missing [unfortunately]. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
