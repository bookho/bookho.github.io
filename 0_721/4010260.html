			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ride is already some age, the face is full of wind and frost The deep and deep marks, but the eyes are still sharp. He glanced at the open, everything was as calm as usual, and he was ready to pass the open space. However, the old horse that accompanied him for a long time refused to take a step, but instead screamed and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and narrowed his eyes and looked forward. He found that the image of the center of the open space began to distort and deform, and then there was a dazzling brilliance in the air. The light is swimming in the air, and the space is cut off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t see anything when you ride your eyes, but he is experienced and immediately blocks his direct glare. After a brief blindness, his vision slowly recovers. , barely see the scene ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few hundred meters away, a huge space portal has been formed. From the water-like light curtain, a team of fully armed fighters are coming from inside. Go out. Their armor styles and Faroese styles are all very different, apparently from some mysterious place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intruder!" The rider almost screamed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a red-hot stick from his waist bag and as soon as he screwed it, he could fly hundreds of meters high and magic The signal is transmitted far away, allowing the magician within 100 kilometers to pinpoint the location of the intruder's portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the switch was turned, the rider hesitated. The intruder’s vanguard had just stepped out of the portal and had not found his whereabouts. Once a warning is issued, it is almost impossible for him to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the rider is getting tighter and tighter, the dripping sweat is dripping from the forehead, and the blue ribs at the forehead are high and swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are coming out of the portal in a team...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you be in the first place? Positioning the intruder's portal, giving the head attack when the intruder has not fully transmitted it, directly determines the battle behind. This is even more critical in this invasion war involving the entire world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ride rides a fierce tooth, and the hands are dead and twisted, so the red-red short stick slams into the air, flies straight to the sky, and the whole body shines brightly. The red light, pulling a very striking red trajectory in the sky, has not been scattered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, the ride is like being exhausted with all the strength, and it is soft. He immediately turned his head and tried to escape to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burly general in the invaders’ pioneering team, riding on the horse, driving the soldiers forward and then moving forward to make room for the follow-up troops. space. The corner of the eye flashed, the red magical warning and the escaped rider fell into the field of vision. His eyes were cold and cold, and he took off the amazingly savvy bow behind him, pulling it, then letting go, the arrow was faint. The fire suddenly went away, spanning hundreds of meters away, and an arrow shot through the back of the ride! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ride is still running down with his head down, but only ran a dozen meters, and the upper body slammed into a bloody rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general thunderous voice allowed the soldiers to deploy to the periphery, and sent a group of light cavalry who had just stepped out of the portal to walk around. Go hunting the enemy's ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more fighters coming out of the portal. When the scale is more than 10,000 people, there is inevitably a little chaos. The voice of the general’s command has been somewhat hoarse, but many of the fighters who have just come out of the portal are still in a semi-vertigo state. Where can I find directions? Some people seem to be a little stubborn even standing. This is also the price of the temporary passage, the ordinary soldiers are inevitably affected, and they are still tired than the long journey of an urgent march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the second general walked out of the portal and let the former general breathe a sigh of relief. Under the joint force of the two generals, they finally maintained order. However, at this moment, the earth suddenly trembled slightly, and the smoke on the horizon on the far side rose and rolled to the point where the eye was in sight. A row of cavalry appeared in shape and was rushing to the portal at full speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals’ faces were slightly changed. Their eyes were sharper than ordinary people, and they were far from the pioneer light cavalry. But the problem is to look at the momentum of dust, just tens of thousands of light rides, then the army behind? How many? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors who have already sent out the portal quickly settled on the spot, reloading the infantry in front, the dragon gun infantry is behind, and the two wings are also withdrawn. Come back, ready to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The near 10,000-light rider has already rushed to the front, and the commander of the other party has apparently discovered that the invaders’ momentum is all elite, and they dare not attack the squadron However, it is divided into two, wrapped in two wings, ready to directly attack the back of the portal. Noland is good at attacking the plane, and Faro has played many battles to eliminate the invaders. He is rich in the experience of attacking and defending the door. It is the key to know that the huge rear plane portal is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the Nolan Grand Army, suddenly a feather arrow was raised, they dragged various magical rays into the sky, then suddenly fell and fell into the light cavalry. In the array, hundreds of magic arrows have produced the effect of thousands of the most elite archers, and a round of arrows rained down more than two hundred rides. Then there was another smashing magical light rising, and two hundred rides rolling and colliding and falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the center of the Noland Army, a sparse square looks different. They are all archers with tall arms and long arms, and a slashing arrow is attached to them with various magic effects, and then brings death to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of the kilometer sprint, the light cavalry has been covered by five rounds of arrow rain, fell thousands of rides on the road! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, these light cavalry did not lose morale by the damage, completely do not want to charge in the assault, go forward and succeed, successfully bypass the square of the front, and directly hit the transmission Near the door is still in the entire team of soldiers, immediately caused a mess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the light cavalry, a burly general held high the Baroque battle flag and roared back and forth in the Noland camp. The battle flag has become his weapon. During the swing, a Noland warrior was picked up in the air and then killed at the sharp tip of the flagpole. The general has a strong bloody smell, like a god in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, a sneer suddenly sounded over the battlefield. Someone said: "I can actually see the Sanctuary strong in this place. It really surprised me. Ok, let me pack you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full body black armor, the strong man of the giant sword just appeared in the portal, and moved forward Take a big step, a hundred meters away from the rush to the Baroque General General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thunderous roar, the two great planes of the Sanctuary strong confrontation for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the two-handed sword and the Baroque battle flag hit each other, they will shoot out the electric light flame. The roaring loud noise is like the thunder of the spring. The overflowing vindictiveness is unstoppable, and the surrounding soldiers are extremely experienced. They quickly retreated as early as the first confrontation between the two. In the struggle between the two powerhouses, ordinary warriors don’t want to intervene, it’s impossible to connect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Baroque is more brave in the Vietnam War, but it is gradually falling behind. He rounded his eyes and slammed his opponent to attack, but the enemy on the opposite side clearly and his vindictiveness was only in the middle of the game. The strength, speed and defense of the sword were completely overwhelming him. The advantage was almost the same. Level battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible..." After a moment, General Baroque looked at the giant sword that pierced his body, unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment of his life, General Baroque’s consciousness suddenly crossed a bolt of lightning. The opponent’s body was flashing from time to time, and there seemed to be a magical array between the rotations. He thought that the opponent’s armor was a legendary level equipment. Now I want to come, the light is directly emitted from the opponent’s skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a build, it must be the structure that I’ve heard recently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword took out lightly, then a maneuver, cut off the head of General Baroque and interrupted his last inspiration. This is the first town powerhouse in the Battle of the Baroque Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blackland’s Nolande Sanctuary waved a giant sword and began a side-by-side slaughter of the light cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland's warriors are also recovering from the chaos. The soldiers who first stepped out of the portal have been able to fight normally. They kill the enemy while they are fighting. Later colleagues tried to recover time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterattack immediately came with a clear advantage, and one baroque light cavalry fell. In a twinkling of an eye, the light cavalry died more than half, but they won the most precious time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is shaking even more, the famous Baroque reloading battle in the mainland, finally like a red gold tide, rolling in! After the heavy ride, there is a large black-pressed infantry, and you can't see the end at a glance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Raymond walked out of the portal under the guards of the Guards, the first sight was an extremely grand battlefield. More than 100,000 soldiers were Fighting and killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front line of the two sides is intertwined, and many places have already had me in you, and I have you, entangled in a group to devour the vortex of life. In the air, on the ground, and even underground, there are strong people who are killing each other, and every minute there are people falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light is constantly flashing, fire clouds, ice storms, thunderclouds, sour fog, etc. A large area of ​​magic continues to appear on the battlefield, how long does it last? , will be dispelled by the other magician. There are more than a dozen dazzling light balls in the air. It is the floating magisters who attack each other and fight hard against each other's front. The big magician who dares to take off in the battlefield is not an ordinary person, at least not afraid to become a target for long-range ground strikes. However, the Norland Grand Magisters dared to take off, and when the Faro standard magician was lifted off, he was immediately attacked by the magic archer and shot like a wild duck. Except for a few really powerful people, the rest of the Faroese mentors were scared to land immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the magical light, there are flashes of magical light from time to time, and a team of blessing warriors have a killing machine, madly fearless Die to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
