			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, the knights appear in succession, their queues and departures The time is also rigorous, but the momentum is even higher. The murderous suffocation forms a faint bloody fog around them, making them look like bloody killers. Many of the knights are wounded. The ride is also not hurt, all the knight's throwing spears are exhausted. The rider's rifle is not seen in the past, and the two-handed swords on the side of the magical rider are also all gaps. The returning knight is only More than one hundred and eighty rides, there are more than a dozen costume knights who are always sleeping in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep black forest, the battle that took place is still in the heart of Richard, and even every knight, it is an indescribable experience. Richard led the formation of the knight into the encirclement of the guardian elves, and then killed it neatly, then Richard turned around again, re-entered into the guardian elves, and then killed, day and night The battle is repeated assault, killing, and turning into the middle. The only rest of the knights is to walk on the road to the next battlefield in Linhai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf hunter, war tree man, beast knight, and even the beast driven by Druid, Richard and his knights met almost all types The guardian elves, but no matter what is in front, they will be ruthlessly crushed in front of this iron horse. The knights almost forget how many times the road has been blocked. Later, as long as there are any guardian spirits dare to When they appear in front of them, they will be killed and shredded by the screaming knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a tree of life appears in the field of vision, the knights know the ultimate goal of the war, around the tree of life, the guardian of the tribe The elves had a desperate resistance, but the hungry knights were even more ferocious. Under the tree of life, the knights finally had casualties, but every knight fell down and seemed to give other The person took a dose of bloodthirsty agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core resistance of this tribe is an old war tree. This horrible war machine wields hard, steel-like branches and has already evaded three people. Inferior to the knight, the knight became a meat, but more knights rushed to the ground, besieging the behemoth of more than 50 meters, all kinds of light-colored spears swaying into the sky In the middle of the tree, the squad of the war tree was too thick. The spear throwing a spear only blew a deep pit on his tree, but it did not cause fatal damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a young costume knight jumped into the air and slammed into a deep pit on the old tree, and then deeply penetrated the gun into the tree heart of the war tree. When the time came, the resistance of this tribe finally collapsed, perhaps between life and death, perhaps burning the brilliance brought by life, and bathing the effect of the ancient tree tree juice, this young man who wanted to give up The Knights not only survived, but also broke through the original level limit and became a sanctuary strongman. This is the first time that Richard’s underarms have broken through the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, returning to the Yongye tribe, Richard once again looked back at his knight and was very satisfied with his heart. This time, not only to destroy the name The little tribes of the thorns are more to cultivate the knights of their men. They want them to develop a fierce and fierce momentum. Many families of the Holy Alliance regard the costume knight as a treasure, and easily refuse to suffer casualties. In the war between Mensa and Richard, even if the battlefield was at an absolute disadvantage, Mensa was reluctant to take out the knights, because Richard had a knight who had a special deal with the knight, and Mensa did it. There is nothing wrong with it, because the decoration and maintenance of the knight is too easy, but he is a big builder, and there is also the number of knights who have a skeleton and a whole assembly line, so he does not know the number of knights. It is better to wear some of the knights at the cost of honing the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the young knight who broke into the sanctuary, Raya, it was an unexpected gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of Richard’s trip is not limited to this. After the thorny tribe was broken, Richard refused the surrender of the tree of life and directed the knights to build the tree of life. Harvesting, harvesting materials, and the harvest of the thorn leaf tribe itself, Richard finally harvested a fruit of life, dozens of leaves of youth, enough to make nearly a thousand bows and 50 branches of natural staff. In addition, there is also the most precious tree of life tree. The heart of the tree is divided into dozens of copies, each of which has to be carried by a knight. This successfully returns to the Yongye tribe. An unexpected harvest is at the root of the tree of life. After discovering a red-hot nodule, Richard discovered that it is a kind of natural fruit. Its function is to greatly enhance the natural strength, and there is a certain chance that the user will increase the natural spring blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the things that can provide blood power are good things. The natural spring is not as good as the natural life tree of the Silver Moon Elf from the perspective of blood power, but its characteristics are mild. It can be a rare advantage with many blood forces. Imagine a strong person who has a strong blood force. If there is more natural spring, the power will of course be further improved. Finally, this one will be added. Natural fruit, Richard’s harvest in the thorn leaf tribe is close to 30 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way home, Richard defeated the interception of the guardian elves twice before returning to the Yongye tribe. At this point, the demon spirits have been beaten, and it is difficult to re-enter after a period of rest. fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped from the magical ride and directed the construction knight to take down the spoils, the bundled refined longbow, the natural method of counting The rods have made the night elves see their eyes straight. When the builders moved a piece of wood that was cut into squares to the tree of life, the two great Druids looked dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, they rushed to the plain white woody green wood, stroking with a trembling hand, and staying in the night The tree of life is also swaying with branches and making a squeaking noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the tree of the tree of life, now divided into dozens, piled up like ordinary wood, for the elves, the tree of life is life The source is the cornerstone of the survival of each elf. Although the high elves do not regard the tree of life as everything as the guardian elves, they also rely heavily on the tree of life. At this moment, the tree of the tree of life is divided. It is so free to pile up, for the Eternal Night Elf, it is no less than seeing the gods fall in front of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken tree of life is in front of the eyes, so that the first night elves have a deep understanding of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ellie stopped in front of Richard, a pair of wild eyes staring at him, and Richard’s heart was a bit imaginary, laughing and asking: What's wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't leave me a task in the future." Ellie said word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Staying is very important, the night tree is so important, except you, I don't worry about others..." Looking at Elio's increasingly dangerous eyes Richard wisely closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, counting the spoils, dealing with injuries, re-repairing weapons and armor, etc., and spent half a day working hard, when everything is finished, according to Greenson’s Time is already in the middle of the night, and Richard still chooses to rest in the hustle and bustle of the tree house. The night elves have rebuilt the bedroom. When Richard unloads all the equipment and is ready to sleep, a figure quietly Sneaked into his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimmer of cold in the darkness, and the moonlight suddenly came out of the sheath, which had already been placed on the neck of the unscrupulous guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after seeing the people through the cold moonlight, Richard felt that there was some headache, so he took up the long knife and sighed: "Alice, how come you come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't come." Ellie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee smiled and replied: "Of course not, I mean, how so sneaky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked straight into Richard’s eyes and said, “Research, what is our relationship.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled, Only when she remembered her almost neglected identity, her partner, and heard Richard’s answer, Ellie was still holding her head high and solemnly asked: “What is the partner’s obligation?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partner’s obligation, of course, is to continue the blood of Archimonde, and there is nothing else. When asked here, Richard understands, so I don’t mean to look at Ellie. The flat lower abdomen, speaking, he and Ellie have only done one time in the Archimonde family cemetery since they established their relationship. Of course, that time did do something special, let Richard remember deeply, then Once is the ritual of establishing a relationship between the two parties. In Richard’s understanding, this relationship is a substantive alliance, due to Jie natural for men to resist, since then, they have never been intimate, but separated for a long time, do Alizee has overcome fear of man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu’s gaze made Ai Li involuntarily take a step back, but then he stood back in front of Richard, straighten his body and put it like a mother leopard A body that combines strength and beauty is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure." Richard asked meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Ellie is now like a general on the battlefield, a heroic decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you don't need to be prepared, I mean, relax first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ellie slammed her hand and shouted: "This little thing, how to use it so complicated, come directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she lies directly On the bed of Richard, the hands were spread out and the legs were separated. It looked really simple, but when it fell on the bed of Richard, she was stiff and stiff like a piece of wood. It was sprinkled on the bed of Richard, and After she fell down, she kept the posture unchanged, like a statue, but Richard was so angry and funny, she was not nervous, clearly the same as last time, nervous to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
