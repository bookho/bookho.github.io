			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the hand of Faschi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in a low voice: "I checked all the goods, only such a complete part, so I brought it back, and the other wills have been burned. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu said slowly: "We have seen her last side now. Then, head, burn her too." According to our ogre tradition, when an ogre is burned or eaten, it will be revived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded, a light stroke, the hand floated in the air, and then a few blue fires rushed to the broken hand, turning it into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at everyone and said, "Resume, there will be new formations and combat missions tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard walked to a lounge. The water splash and the Zonghu also went back to rest, and Tiramisu simply lay down on the spot and sounded in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Mex stood in the same place and was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard suddenly turned back and said, "Mex, come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mex hurriedly followed Richard into the lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard took off his robes and broke the wound. The biggest wounds on his body are shining like the tiramisu, and it is obviously hit by the main gun of the medium-sized fighter. It is contaminated with strong toxins, so the wound can not only heal, but also oozes pus . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Mex, and the voice said a little low: "I shouldn’t lose your temper during the day, I just learned about them." The news of death, some... out of control. I underestimated the cruelty of this war, it is not your fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex Shaking his head and saying, "I am willful! You don't take all your responsibilities on your own! You are not the supreme Supreme, and you can't put everything on yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said: "I am the lord. I am responsible for every decision I make, and I am responsible for all those who follow me. I hope that if possible, I can climb higher and better. Everyone’s death has a responsibility for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Richard has cleaned up the wound. However, the wound is still shining green, the toxic substance is stubborn and remains, and it will not fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in Li’s eyes flashed, and a blue fire burned on his own wound! This time, Mex expected, and he could not help but exclaim. At the wound, the flesh of the wound was instantly blackened, but the green toxic substances were emptied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to clean all the residual venomous wounds, and then slowly sat down, and the breath became very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go help me get something to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex went by In a blink of an eye, I will return a full box of battlefield food. She is very clear about how big the super strong will be. Richard was weak enough to move to the food, but as he ate, his breath began to recover and his wounds showed signs of improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the magic clock pointed to nine o'clock, Richard finally recovered completely. He regrouped his men, the water and the tigers still, and Mexus would follow Tiramisu. After a while, the messengers flew out of the valley and rushed to their intended destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another day of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex felt like he was constantly killing a reaper, and then it was a little mechanically numb. But it was such a little bit of care, she was immediately locked and bombarded by a medium-sized fighter. If Tiramisu was in front of her with a giant hammer, Mex would definitely be pierced by a high-energy beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, Mex and Tiramisu finally returned to the temporary base. Only Zonghu returned to here, and the water flower went through the control area as planned and went to a base in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until midnight, Richard was dragging a tired and injured person. When he has finished the injury and is ready to rest, take a vial from a space bracelet that he carries with him. The bottle is filled with liquid silver metal, which has filled the entire bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark caves, the silver metal in the bottle exudes a soft glow and flows slowly on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light shines on Richard’s face, and it gives Richard a sense of tranquility that cannot be said. It is like having its own soul and life, constantly telling something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a strange metal, unlike any metal that Richard has seen in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even hard to determine whether it is metal. So far, all the means he knows have no effect on this silver metal, even if it is an invincible blue fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also sent a drop of silver metal to the nest, and as a result the mother's nest could not be digested, and was trying to melt it down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took up the bottle and figured out that the team of three reapers would be hunted today and should be able to fill the bottle. Thinking about it this way, he gradually got tired, closed his eyes and went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard did not think at this moment that for a long time to come, this is the best and longest sleep of his sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day's battle, the hardship far exceeded that of Richard's expectations, and exceeded everyone's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has clearly noticed a significant increase in the reaper's strength, so he fought hard and destroyed the formation of one reaper. However, more reaper formations have emerged, this time they completely ignore Richard, the high-speed from the top of the head of Licha or passed by, toward the hinterland of the Iron Triangle Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reaper began a large-scale fleet formation with several medium-sized fighters, dozens of small fighters, and hundreds of miniature fighters. What really chills is the transport group behind the formation! Nearly a hundred transport planes mean a huge war force that is enough to flatten the Cold Iron Throne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the formations at the same time found that the pressure they faced suddenly increased, almost to the point of suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always people who are strong and dead, and those who are still alive are blind, they don’t know when the battle will come to an end, and they don’t know the distance. How many reapers are there. At this moment, all the formations received the order of Richard: retreat immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without explaining why, the strong guys don't ask why, since this day, continuous high-intensity battles have enabled them to build enough trust and confidence in Richard, and they immediately retreat according to the planned schedule and route. It was not until they retreated to a temporary base hundreds of kilometers away that they understood what had happened. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were fighting in a desperate battle, thinking that the reaper was successfully pinned, the amazing number of reapers suddenly appeared, passing through Richard’s organization with the strong Weak defense lines, pounced deep into the territory of the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few hours, sixteen large and small cities in the eastern part of the Iron Triangle Empire were completely destroyed. More Reaper Forces are still appearing, they expand in a fan shape, and even leave a temporary replenishment base behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of the turbulent land, the reapers were the first to encounter obstacles, and the army of the mother's nest cooperated with the nest forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's expansion is far faster than Richard's imagination. He had to change the layout, and all the strong people were transferred to the defense line to rest and reorganize the defense. At this point, the large-scale Legion War finally began to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's offensive is a lang higher than a lang, they have a quantitative advantage, and have a quality advantage, and it seems that they never feel tired. Under such an attack, the Iron Triangle Empire did not unexpectedly collapse, and the newly formed defense line only supported the two-day breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new elite empire formed by Sharonville was completely annihilated, and the empire’s first-line army was annihilated by more than ten. It can be said that it was more than this day. In the time, the Iron Triangle Empire has been disabled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only turbulent place in the South that can support it. At the same time, the army of the Dark Red Kingdom cooperated with the Brood's Army and established a defense line in the west of the turbulent land. In spite of the heavy casualties in the past few days, it was finally deadly against the reaper's offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's army is like a turbid stream, hitting the turbulent land, and immediately split into two. Some turned to the west, into the army that attacked the Iron Triangle Empire, and the other part turned to the east, all the way to the beach, and then crushed from the vast number of human kingdoms in the east, all the way south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reapers in both directions are like a pair of crab claws, aiming at the deep red kingdom to start to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
