The magical effect of the level of the sorcerer has reached the limit and the saturation overflows, but there are still many hidden injuries in the internal organs and bones, that is, the four huge wounds that have been cut can only be closed. It takes a few days of uninterrupted spiritual healing and rest to fully recover. However, in less than a day, Richard will fight with Iraq and Russia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard not only had all the injuries, but also all the internal injuries. He was just extremely excited and he could not stand up in front of the followers. After returning to the room, my heart was loose, and I couldn’t help myself. I passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha sighed and once fought side by side for so long, she naturally knew the physical condition of Richard. So she didn't panic, but carefully let Richard lay flat, then released a cure, and a healing effect. Although his body has been difficult to absorb this level of treatment, but even if most of it overflows, how much is infiltrated into it, so the two gods go down, Richard's breathing turns steady and falls asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is sitting down in the chair, holding the elbows on the table, holding the lower jaw, and starting to remember the bits and pieces of the relationship with Richard. Thinking about it, an uncontrollable fatigue rushed into the air, making her feel more and more eyelids, and finally sleepy and drowning consciousness. The cold war between these days and Richard is actually very consuming, and she is already exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long sleep, the sand suddenly screamed and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so moved, accidentally touched the flower stand next to it, the porcelain vase on it rolled down, and the slamming slammed on the ground. A black glimmer flashed through the sight of the sand. In her heart, she stood up immediately, and she surely caught a shadow drill rolling on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of sand whispered, ran over and picked up the shadow drill, carefully observed, and finally confirmed that it was indeed a shadow drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched her pocket and pulled out a shadow drill. Two valuable shadow drills lie in the palm of the sand, and the sand is clear that it was not just an intermediate shadow creature, but two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, crazy..." Looking at the still sleeping Richard, the sand can't say anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the meal time, the magic clock in the room of Richard pointed to the time of the booking and began to sound crisply. Richard immediately turned over and bounced directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swayed his head hard, only to find himself lying on the ground, but his body was wrapped in a quilt. He first saw the sand, so he smiled, then turned his head and glanced at the magic clock, and immediately exclaimed: "Oops! Have an appointment with the nobles to eat together! Sand, come and help me change clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Richard has put on a new set of clothes, but the bruise on his face has no way to disappear in such a short time, even the gods Can't cover it all. Richard did not care so much, went straight to the banquet venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sat in the banquet hall, and more than a dozen aristocratic representatives came one after another. The highest status of these people is Viscount Heim. He didn't need anyone to greet him, and he walked to the side of Richard and walked on his own. Not waiting for everyone to express surprise at the move of Viscount Heim, the representatives of these nobles or business groups all saw the face of Richard's face bruised, and was extremely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and pointed at the bruises on his face and said: "Someone wants to rob me of a woman and just had a fight with him in the morning. This is the badge of the winner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the nobles are on the verge of a sudden, and the eyes of Richard are much taller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very common thing for the aristocrats to fight for love. Richard is a noble magician, but he is not afraid to fight with the enemy like a knight. Suddenly stirred up the resonance of many nobles present. The one who came to the Blue Water Oasis on behalf of the forces invited by Richard, at least had to be a jazz, highly admired for the traditional nature of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meal time is very short, after all, no one is coming to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making the necessary welcoming words, Richard directly brought all the representatives to the war room, then pointed to the map on the map of the blood-stained land and opened the door. Said: "The line plan is very simple, starting from here, all the way to the west, until you reach the pale highlands, find the dwarf country! Our first layer of harvest is a transaction. Our army can also become a caravan, The rich ore of the pale highlands is brought back. The second layer of harvest is that we will defeat all the forces that are blocking us! Ma Rong, Red Cossack, Cano Vincent Camp, Cracked Rock Canyon, Black Flame Mountain, etc. Any force will dare to block our way, and he/mother/smash it! The line plan will establish our absolute authority in the blood-stained land, clear out any threatening forces, and get through to a dwarf The safe road of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard’s fingers all the way across the map, the noble representatives could not help but hold their breath! This is a very crazy plan, but once realized, it will bring crazy benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aristocrats here are able to work together, it is still possible to accomplish such a feat. But this is like mobilizing the nearly half aristocrat of the Sequoia Kingdom, almost a national war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the major issues, those who had received an invitation to believe that Richard was a madman, also sent representatives. They are not necessarily ready to join, but they can't be considered as friendly neighbors to do such big moves at home, but they are not there. Who knows which edge the final blade will point to. There is no similar conspiracy in the history of the human kingdom, such as the division of Bordeaux thirty-eight years ago. They didn't think that they would really hear a crazy, tempting but not entirely whimsical plan. After a moment of silence, a noble representative finally asked a key question: "Who is the coalition commanded?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li hands on the conference table, staring at the representative, said: "Of course I am, do you have better candidates?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people on the scene showed a strange expression on their faces. They knew that Richard wanted to play a leading role in this Westward advancement, but he did not expect that he was so straightforward and raised without any cover. It seems that he is not even prepared to explain more to convince the representatives. This is to block the room for further bargaining in the future, which is very different from the habit of aristocratic negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to come up with a better candidate than Richard, but it’s not the case when you think about it. Richard’s recent record has been widely circulated, reinventing the main force of the Duke of Glasgow’s heavy squad, the army of the Viscounts, who spent a lot of money, and killed the sacred strongman Sir Odom, whichever is the case. Enough for a big aristocrat to brag for a few years, but they are concentrated on Richard. Although such a record is not unique, it is at least not part of the family of the lords who are present today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
