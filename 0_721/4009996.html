			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened a skin bag that the pro-military sent him, which was found from the dwarf firearms, filled with gunpowder. Richard poured some gunpowder into the bottle, then placed the bottle on a rock and retreated to the distance. He raised his hand and fired a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang, the gunpowder bottle blasted, and the momentum exceeded the imagination of Richard! A small bottle of gunpowder bursts the rock below, and the waves even spread to Richard, a dozen meters away, while the splashing fragments cut a few barbarians who were close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fried Richard is well known. This kind of gunpowder is obviously a new formula, which is several times more powerful than the gunpowder used by the Norden dwarf. It is with them as medicines that the power of those muskets will be so great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the quicksand, handed the musket and gunpowder to the sand, let her see it, and said with emotion: "I didn't expect it, The Faro plane actually has something ahead of Noord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s words, the sands heard a lot of vigilance and worry. . There are a few dwarf muskets in front of them, so in the future there may be some sort of alchemy, even a strange machine powered by gunpowder or something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, this is a plane of strength that is not much weaker than Noland. It also has a legendary powerhouse, which means that it is equally possible to have a miracle. So far, apart from the lack of the magical structure and the dragon of eternal and time, other places have really not seen any difference with Noland. Norland's magical civilization is indeed more developed, but from the knowledge and experience accumulated in the endless plane war, the magic civilization is not the only high-order civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands carefully inspect every part of the gun, and then look at the gunpowder, and keep reading it in the book of Time. After a while, he said: "Sure enough, their muskets are much more powerful than the Norland Dwarf muskets. However, we may not have to worry too much about it. Richard, think about it, the Norand dwarf is also a powerful Race, they occupy a lot of territory, and there are several great empires. Do you remember what the tribe dwarves in Noland are known for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge is equally rich, and immediately said without thinking: "The cornerstone of the dwarf kingdom is the big warrior, holy warrior and pastor. I mean combat power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes The Norland's dwarves are not known for their muskets, nor do they need muskets," said Liu Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked thoughtfully and said, "What you mean is that because Noland’s magic and combat system is too strong, it suppresses the musket. """"""""""""""""" It has become the same as the original dwarf musket, but it can only be used against Warcraft. You know, in Noland, you can find a dozen big magicians casually. In front of them, there are more dwarf firemen. They are nothing but cannon foils with iron bars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pondered for a moment, but shook his head and said, "This is not necessarily! Perhaps this kind of musket It can't affect the pattern between the strong, but it can change the situation on the battlefield. If the number of muskets reaches a certain scale, like my throwing soldiers, the power will be incredible! In some specific occasions, for example Fortress defense, can completely become the enemy's nightmare! And don't forget, here is the law ., Farrow is not casually be able to pull out a dozen great magician "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Later, Richard inquired about the situation of some of the Thunder's anvil tribes. He learned that this is a large tribe with a population of hundreds of thousands. The number of muskets in the tribe is tens of thousands. Dwarves rarely have guys who are willing to deal with numbers, so none of these guys in front of Richard can give a roughly precise range. Anyway, the musket has a lot of anvils in the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the dwarf muskets to take them down first. He has to digest this thing slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the battlefield cleanup work has been completed. This caravan is transported by the rare ore from the Thunder’s Anvil Tribe, from Mithril and Fine Iron. There are more than a dozen kinds of spherical steel. If these ores can be shipped to the Sequoia Kingdom, the price will exceed 200,000 gold coins! The cost of purchasing this ore, plus all the caravans and related expenses, together with more than 20,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the blood-stained land is ten times more profiteering! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Richard’s retreat to the Sequoia Kingdom has been temporarily blocked, the goods need to pass through the various forces of the Blue Water Oasis if they are to be realized immediately. The Iron Triangle Empire is not only a long way to go, but also the home of the Red Cossacks. Richard is not stupid enough to rob their caravans and then go to their hometown to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard has a new understanding of the value of the blood-stained land, especially the richness of the pale highlands and the ancestral highlands. Because in this caravan, I also found a few large pieces of magic crystal ore! If these pieces of ore are cut into standard units of magic crystal, you can exceed 70 units! This means that the parent nest can add another fifth-order or fifth-order capability. Used in the construction, it is enough to make more than a dozen shrinkable plates. More importantly, there is a magic crystal deposit on the territory of the anvil of the pale high ground. This made Richard more interested in the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a hundred people survivors of the caravan, and Richard ordered that they be given the opportunity to let them appear in the bloody land again. Bring back. Richard is neither benevolent nor addicted to killing, and he is beginning to have a taste of harmony. But this is not a sign that he wants to ease the relationship with the red Cossack. After being chased by the Red Cossack for more than a month in the last round, Richard was determined to wipe the caravan from the bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to take advantage of the blood-stained land, it is impossible to fully demonstrate the power, and the best way to demonstrate strength is to make a strong area The forces are disabled or obliterated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all this was done, Richard called a guard, let him take the fast horse to the blue water oasis and contact several important people. The annihilation of such a large-scale caravan, Richard’s plan needs to change. Goods with at least dozens of cars can't be maneuvered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road behind is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, Richard came to the Blue Water Oasis and reunited with several old friends in the restaurant that was last auctioned. Although the blue water oasis has inevitably experienced the baptism of the blood of Sinclair, these old friends are obviously very knowledgeable people, and all of them are still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman was more fatter than the last time. According to him, it’s really nothing to do recently, only to eat two more foods to satisfy the physical desires. To fill the emptiness of the mind. So the more melancholy, the more fat he will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman gradually showed some sharp temperament, while Billier was worried. Clark seems to be more interested in Richard himself, and he keeps watching him without any disguise. Fortunately, he has restrained and does not use Scouting skills like Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
