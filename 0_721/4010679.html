			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hummingbird is silent for a while, as if the nest behind it is thinking about something After a while, it seems to inadvertently say: "Right, I will start the process of promotion in the near future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond suddenly becomes serious Q: "Golden, tenth order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the master has chosen the direction of the promotion for me: to maximize the mother's survival." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s face showed a meaningful smile and said: “This is the best choice for you. It’s amazing, as a war. The machine you, how to say, should strengthen the creative ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, I am also very surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Raymond stood up and squatted back and forth in the courtyard, saying: "According to the past records, when the mother's nest is promoted to the tenth order, it is possible to awaken the real name, that is, I can give it to you. Method, regain A free soul, this method has had a successful precedent in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, it will consume a lot of precious resources."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the mother's nest is seriously considering, Raymond's heartbeat is slightly faster, but he took a few deep breaths, the voice did not fluctuate too much: "The so-called resources What is really rare is nothing more than the will of some powerful creatures. Other things can be bought in Noland. Mass is not short of money. You can be satisfied by asking him, as for powerful creatures... ...this is a bit difficult, but you have a Zonghu that can make up part of it, at most, the success rate is lower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest is silent for a while, seems to be calculating what, Then said: "The success rate is only 27%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is very surprised: "So high, in my calculations, it seems only Fifteen percent is right, but this is a good thing and it is very worthwhile to try. After all, failure has no consequences, isn't it, the resources consumed are nothing at all, believe me, the resources of the entire plane in the future are yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Maybe... you can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is now really nervous and asks: "If you succeed, you will be given the terms of negotiation. New body and eternal life." But because Raymond is squatting in the circle, the hummingbird can turn his body movements and most facial expressions into his eyes as he walks around his head, but he can’t see it. Into his eyes, and there is a completely silent silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no eternal life, even if I am promoted to the tenth order, combined with the body created by the divine nature, there are still defects, and its natural life is only one thousand one hundred Years, when time is up, you need to replace your new body, but every time you change your body, your soul is weakened once, so your life is still limited." The mother's nest explained patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond said: "It’s better than now, isn’t it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation ends here. The hummingbird fluttered and flew away, and Raymond sat back to the table. The expectation and embarrassment on his face gradually faded away and replaced with calmness and indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a notebook and opened it. Inside was a painting of ink strokes. It was originally a big belly mosquito with a strange shape. Later It gradually becomes more sophisticated, and then it is bat-shaped. Finally, it is a beautiful and delicate hummingbird. It is much smaller than the original mosquito, but it travels faster, is farther away, and can have a life of up to one year. With some independent wisdom, he can also replace the nest and Raymond dialogue. He believes that after the hummingbird returns, he can play back all the images he sees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notebook draws on the hen’s nest who has been in contact with him and transported the nutrients needed to sustain his life, putting them together, It can be seen that although the mother nest has remained in the ninth order, the understanding of life forms has been deepening. Recently, the voice of the hummingbird has also changed, not only the sound quality, but the mechanical sense. There are more fluctuations. For example, when I talked about the direction of the Jin Dynasty, Raymond could even hear the emotion of personification. It seems that I can feel the other person's accident and puzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond tapped on the table, his mouth smiled and whispered to himself: "A free mother's nest... Richard, what will you be when you arrive?" Expressions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Dagong Castle, there is another heavily guarded area, where the magic zone of the Qiqi Construction Lab is located. The vast majority, occupying nearly one-third of the entire inner city, and separated by high walls and other areas, every other distance on the high wall, there is a circle that can absorb magic energy, this is to prevent The most frequent explosions and leaks in the Magic Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's own laboratory, as well as Qi Qi's magic workshop, are in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A split brain grabs the magic box with the ambition, takes off from the terrace of Richard, and ascends into the sky, in dozens of elites The wind snake's escort flew down to the turbulent land, and Richard left the castle alone, carrying a small box of magic to go to the magic zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic zone is responsible for guarding the elite knights, they will naturally not recognize Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Qi Qi." Richard asked in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye he got a response, an elite squadron sent a topographic map with no cursor on the current position of Qi Qi, and The best road map to reach the destination, as always, Qi Qi is still in her own laboratory, as if it is her home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently calculated the time of the algorithm, and suddenly there was a slight tremor in her heart. It has been several years since she first entered Faro until now, but 珞Qi has never changed the law of work and rest. She dedicated the girl's youthful years to the world of makeup and magic. Whoever thought about it, she also had the moment when she called the most brilliant pearl of the Mensa family. The second appearance in front of people is the focus of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the magic box and walked along the route suggested by the elite squadron to the lab of Qi Qi, so that for Richard, In fact, I am already familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the Qiqi Lab, there is a long overhead gallery from which you can see the working area of ​​the Magic Workshop below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large-scale work area at the moment, most of the workbench is busy with the mage, and hundreds of young mages and apprentices are running back and forth. Collect the components that have already been made, do a basic inspection quickly, and then send the required materials to the designated station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that people in the work area are busy, but when they look carefully, they find that they are in order, going to the primary structure, down to the lowest level. Apprentices, everyone knows what they should do, they are busy, but they are not hindered by conflicts. This reflects the well-designed process and smart management. No wonder every other day and a half, there will be a Qiqi Knight from here. go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he saw this work area, Richard was very fortunate that he had won Qi Qi from the hands of Xiaomen Sa, and the value of Qi Qi was not limited to a builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the promenade, and then turn a corner, it’s the lab of Qi Qi. At this moment, Richard suddenly heard the faintness coming from the front. Quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party that quarreled was Qi Qi, and the other side was the voice of a man. When Li’s mind moved, he converges and breathes silently. At the entrance of the laboratory, the door was opened, and Qi Qi’s private laboratory had multiple magic alarm devices, but there were two full-rights, one was Qi Qi and the other was Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard steadily entered the lab, and the quarrel was constantly coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qi Qi, I don’t understand your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞Qi said faintly: "In my world, there is only magic and structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still that person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, except for magic and construction, he is all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man screamed angrily: "Why He has something good for you. You have to think about him like this. It’s been a year. It’s been a year. Have you seen it once, and I’ve heard from Noland recently that he’s already It became the male pet of His Royal Highness, and I, I have been here for three years, I don’t understand your heart, as long as you follow me, I will return to the family immediately, to my father. Bowing down, to inherit the family's count, I promise you not a lover, not a partner, but a marriage. You are the right countess in the future, isn't it good, a countess, how can you compare? Now life is strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 sighed and said: "He gave me the whole world, you don't understand, Link, go back. I haven’t happened tonight, if you are entangled, don’t blame me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not leave, but was silent However, his breathing is getting louder and louder. Obviously, anger is still accumulating, waiting for the next outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
