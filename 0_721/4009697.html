			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ice floes, the sun jumped out of the icebergs and ascended into the sky. The bright sun shone into the window, pressing the magical glory of ‘primary agility’, and it felt a bit stinging for Richard’s exhausted eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the eyes of the sorrowful sputum, carefully packed the magic pattern, and then hurriedly left the residential area to find Phil, who taught him the magical knowledge. Great Magister, to determine the next study plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair is worthy of the title of the master, not only because of the magic of the 19th level, but more because of his profound knowledge, many pioneering in the philosophy of magic Sexual discussion, as well as being fair and harmonious. Now Phil is the mentor of the Richard Magic Circle course, and in the future, he will also be Richard's mentor in the magic pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical structure involves a large number of disciplines and requires extremely profound knowledge, but it does not have a fixed path. The research of the last millennium has only initially divided it into seven levels from the bottom up. The first four levels each have a different number of standard magic patterns. The ability to draw the primary magical structure is not a formal constructor, only the second-level construction is recognized as a true builder. The big builder is the title of the builder who can draw the third and fourth grades. In the end, any builder who can make even a five-level magic pattern will be crowned as a holy builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the sixth and seventh levels of the magic pattern, it is more in people's guesses and delusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is still very early, and there are not many people walking in the dark blue. In the heart of Li, he rushed out of the transmission circle and stood at the entrance to the exclusive upper area of ​​Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance is two bronze giant gates that are closed regardless of day and night, with a magical beak on each side. One of the cockroaches aligned the ruby-set one-eyed eye with Richard and shot a dark red light. Under the light, the badge of the collar of the magical robe of Licha instantly lit up, and the cockroach returned to its original position, and the light in one eye was extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire upper level of the deep blue is the exclusive area of ​​the legendary mage, but the bottom layer of the exclusive area is assigned to the most senior of the big magisters as living. The region reflects the generosity, trust and love of His Highness. Their daily living and magic labs are located here, so the entire five-story area is full, but there are 17 big magisters. Master Phil is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was allowed to enter the private area of ​​Master Phil, the master had just finished the morning meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair casually wears a magical robe, and the gestures are full of exuberant elements. Such a strong elemental affinity allows the concentration of magic around Phil to far exceed the ordinary space. As a student of Phil, even if he just stands by and listens, it will have a slow but lasting benefit to the accumulation of magic. But just in the face of just meditation, or in front of the most important students, Phil Master will release the elemental atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Phil’s eyes passed a hint of unappreciative appreciation. He pointed to the chair next to him, indicating that Richard was sitting down and taking it himself. After a bottle of magic to restore the potion, drink a few mouthfuls. Richard did not sit, but took out the animal skin carrying 'primary agility' and handed it over and said, "Teacher, this is my work inspired by last night's inspiration. I want to ask for your advice."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at those delicate and delicate patterns, you know that this magic array is absolutely superior in quality. Phil smiled in a rare way, took over the skin, and was trying to praise Richard for a few words, but suddenly changed his face! Looking at a few more eyes, Phil's body couldn't help but tremble. He stood up violently, but it was too urgent because of the momentum. The robe sleeves reached the bottle and only half of the powerful magic recovery agent was drunk. The exquisite crystal bottle, together with the half bottle of medicine worth more than 2,000 gold coins, slipped off the table and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair, who has always been thrifty, can’t take care of the pharmacy. When he looks at Richard, his eyes have already shot the magical light, and the elements of the scorpion are violently surging. Almost, you have to set off an elemental storm indoors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked seriously: "You said this was what you did last night? Do you know what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenzied elemental storm made Richard almost out of breath, and he stood in a difficult position, calmly replied: "Primary attribute-enhanced magic pattern: primary agility. It can only be barely finished." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair then noticed his own gaffe, slowly gathered the elements of the scattered energy, sat back, and carefully looked at the hands of the half-day The animal skin, slowly said: "'Reluctantly complete'? Hey! This is indeed the case. As a magical structure, it can only say that it is barely qualified. But when it is less than 13 years old, it can make a 'stainless qualification'. The guy with the magic pattern has counted in the history of the whole continent! Richard, I believe that you will not lie, but this is not reasonable. Your course has not yet reached the stage of integration. In addition to being unreasonable, there must be other factors in order to make you suddenly open and separate all the magic The system is brought together. If you don't mind, would you like to talk to me about the special experience since this time? I think this will help you grow in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master is a respectable person, and Richard does not feel any negative emotions from him. And the world of magic is so complicated, full of unknowable dangers, and having a wise guide is more important than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard has summarized all the things outside the magical curriculum over the past year, but has hidden the part related to Irene. In his understanding, the intimate movement between the two sexes only allowed him to accelerate his maturity, but he certainly had nothing to do with magic. In addition, even things that have been learned with Naa are not hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Phil doubles his eyebrows, subconsciously wants to stand up, but leans back against the back of the chair. He raised his hand and motioned that Richard could stop, then looked up at the ceiling, thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Master Phil said: "It turned out to be him. I didn't expect the disaster blade of the year to come to dark blue. Is his name Naia now? This is his original name, almost never used. What he teaches you should be one of the reasons that prompts you to open up barriers between disciplines. Killing and creation are all about learning in all fields."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and asked: "So, can I continue to learn from him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master Phil has indulged for a moment and said: "It should be possible at the moment. The disaster is not, now it is Naia, once a person who has status in the entire dark world. His accomplishments in killing are close. In art, teaching you at least for a few years should be no problem. But I want to know why you suddenly have the idea of ​​learning to kill art?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because To create a more powerful knight, you must know how to kill people more effectively."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
