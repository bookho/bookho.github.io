It seems that they are also used to study or maintain the environment, not to defend against the enemy. At least, Richard did not see the device that released the magic energy attack on the apex. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an enemy traverss the whispering forest and sneaked directly from the Lake of Dreams, then you can cross the city and take the imperial palace, and Richard’s mind just floated on the idea and immediately gave it Negative, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shortcut, but it can be said to be the most difficult route, because the emperor’s palace is home to the Garan emperor, and Wu Shengzang The manor of the sword is in the depths of the whispering forest,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the Emerald Lake are more used for decoration and urban management than for defending the enemy,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the millennium, on the occasion of the founding of the Millennium Empire, the founding hero of the country, Roman Roland, stood in a dream The lakeside published a famous national speech,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said at the time: "If my enemy can get here, then the empire will also perish, so Emerald Day The lake will be an undefended city, and my descendants must have the courage to keep any enemy out of the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the Millennium Empire Continuing the extremely tough external style, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next generation of emperors continued to expand externally. The biggest setback in centuries was the failure of the north, but the Millennium Empire was defeated at that time. The hand of Charles,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles and his seven generals were unable to pass the North Continent, and established a sacred alliance on this basis, after which he launched The largest expedition in the history of the Terran, completed the great cause of the abyss of the great lord of the Abyss, Dharma, and the martial arts. It is unprecedented, and no one came after,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Jadeite Tianhu, in addition to the beauty given by nature, walks in it, everywhere Both can feel the precipitation of history and time. Perhaps a very ordinary sculpture may have a long history, which is quite different from the exotic style of fascinating, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Standing in front of a small hotel, Richard looked at the fountain in the middle of the courtyard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stone sculpture of the elf girl in the fountain. Class decoration and sculpture, in the emerald Tianhu, it is almost flooding. This stone carving has at least a hundred years or even a long history, but there are many more ancient sculptures in the Emerald Lake. What really attracts Richard is The details of the clothes on this elf girl, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, do you like this statue very much." A crisp voice interrupted Richard's thoughts, < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at the past, only to see a young girl, wearing a hotel maiden clothes, so she smiled and said: "Yes, look It’s very history, and her clothes and hair accessories are very special.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the face of Richard, the girl’s eyes are bright and brighter. Smile, said: "You are really erudite, and so young, in fact, this statue comes from Yong Yesen. Originally the silver moon elves left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "It is indeed a masterpiece of art."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly said with some indignation: "The Silver Moon Elf is a noble and noble elf. The Everlasting Forest is said to be the most beautiful place on the mainland of Noland, but it was the outbreak of the Holy Alliance. The households and the barbarians have been destroyed. I heard that they even burned the world tree in a fire. God, can you imagine how bad this is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton was a bit embarrassed, and at the same time, there was a lingering grief in the bottom of his heart. Gordon and Elaine came together in this war, then split their eyes and never met again. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said, "That is indeed a regret forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl Suddenly remembered something, busy said: "Ah, I have to go to work, if you let Aunt Winsor know that I have chatted with people and forgot the time, I will marry me again. Have you just arrived at the Emerald Tianhu, have you found a place to live, if not, live in our store, I will prepare a pot of flowers for you, and at night, Aunt Winsor will also make a baking pie, many people They all ran to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Richard agreed, and then looked up and looked at the small hotel,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard and the building in front of it are small, but very delicate and clean. Like many buildings in the Emerald Lake, it is also very old, at least two or three hundred years old,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard asked for a bright and clean room, the price is very moderate according to the standard of the Emerald Lake,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s heart immediately verified the view of Richard , a young, elegant, promising intermediate mage, to travel to find opportunities for breakthroughs, or to come to the Emerald Tianhu to find a future,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard stayed, the girl sent a glass of wine and dessert, and quickly said: "My name is Irene." I ran out quickly,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Irene, this is a name that was almost forgotten by Richard, but when it was wiped off the dust, it was found hidden in the corner, intact,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard shook his head helplessly, and buried this memory again. The laughter of the same name girl silver bell came out of the window. The nose was in the afternoon. The scent of the air that evaporates from the air, all the sorrows and haze seem to go with the wind,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out for a while and picked up the hotel on the desk for the guests. The map of the Emerald Tianhu, looking at it carefully, imprints every detail in your mind,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still one day away from the official auction, he can Take a walk around the city, maybe you can find something interesting,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tungshu District is a famous adventurer’s paradise in the city, it is everywhere There are a variety of shops related to war and adventure, and most shops also buy materials from the adventurers who have visited them at the same time, so there are quite a few weird things. Richard is ready to spend an afternoon strolling here, try his luck. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the Tongshu District, the first thing that caught his eye was the various shop signs and eye-catching door decorations in the shade of the trees. These shop buildings are themselves works of art, and they are endowed with a special value by the long history. The adventurer is walking here, looking for opportunities, or changing the spoils into money,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A visit to the shop, I was surprised to find it here. There have been a lot of high-level magic items, and the goods are still above the floating trade zone,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way down, Richard's backpack is gradually full, filled with magical materials, and even a few materials that can be used in the Battle of Midrand, this is an unexpected surprise, of course, the price It’s also very expensive. For this whole package of materials, Richard paid the magic crystal equivalent to 500,000 gold coins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s returned to the small dinner. The hotel, enjoying the delicious pie of Aunt Winsor, and chatting with Irene for a while, then stretched out and prepared to go back to her room. Irene’s eyes were a bit resentful, but Richard only left her a Smile, just close the door,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee opened the carry-on kit and began to draw a bunch of key functional magic arrays. The quiet night is like this. The next morning, Richard hired a carriage to the seat of the scheduled auction, the private theater of the Dukes of Abis,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard went to the gate, two guards in gorgeous armor stopped At the same time, there are several powerful spiritual fluctuations sweeping through Richard, showing that the defensive power in the dark is extremely powerful, far from being as simple as the two slick sentinels,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He took out the invitation, handed it to the guard, and then waited quietly,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, an elderly mage rushed out to Richard Holding and respecting and saluting, said: "His Highness, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was directly led to a box in the theater, here Three people are waiting for him, one is the Marquis of Lu Hao who issued the invitation, the other is the legendary Magister, and the third is a middle-aged aristocrat,<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;;;;;; When Richard came in, the three people stood up politely,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Haohou First of all, I smiled and said: "I didn't expect that His Royal Highness actually came in person. Especially in this sensitive period, we feel very honored. Please let me introduce, this master Tom is a famous appraisal master."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
