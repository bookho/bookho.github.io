			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately heard a huge unspeakable heartbeat, his three The heart is pulsating with this sound at the same time, making him uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was suddenly a violent shock in the corridor, and Tiramisu jumped out of the passage, and the ogre lord slammed the hammer and rushed to Lee. All the little devils on the body were mashed into meat sauce, and then said, "Hey, how are you in a daze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't hear the heartbeat? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing the question of Richard, Tiramisu's two faces are very awkward: "Which heartbeat, here is the little devil is noisy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't hear it." Richard asked again, and after getting a sure answer from both heads, he immediately fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights, followers, and frost warriors rushed into the corridor from the passage, and they quickly built a line of defense to block the demon like a tide. outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large promenade allows Tiramisu to fight comfortably, but the strange thing is that after Richard, you can’t see the end of the promenade, the little devil They are constantly coming from the front, and the number is increasing. There are thousands in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many strong individual strengths, but the number is too much, and they are going to fight down, even the first-line knights can’t resist. , slowly retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor was quickly covered with the body of the little demon, and the new little demon stepped on the companion’s body, attacking condescendingly, for a while Richard, a powerful army capable of sweeping Faro, was actually unstable and forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axiris came to Richard and said eagerly: "His Highness, this is the endless cloister of the abyss, it is actually an abyss Connected together, so in a sense we are fighting the demons of the entire abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not in a hurry to make reinforcements or retreat The decision was made, but a closer look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, his true vision immediately penetrated the fog, and noticed the change. The demon embossing on the wall of the promenade was actually active at the moment. Once there was an empty space in the endless corridor, a group of little devils would jump out and fill the space. On the wall of the promenade, whenever the little demon jumps out, Richard will feel the strong spatial fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Achilles is right, the Endless Promenade is indeed connected in some way to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked awkward and asked: "Is there a big demon, even a demon lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is no, the endless cloister is not a plane transmission channel. It is a means used by the abyss to connect certain secrets or specific spaces. There are at most one or two big devils occasionally. This endless cloister is located in Faro. This level of plane, even the big devil will not appear, at most some intermediate demons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to pass."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris pointed to the direction of the little devil and said, "That is our direction. Just follow the corridor and go through it. When you have enough distance, you will naturally arrive." At the end of the exit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked down behind him and frowned. "Then behind us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The direction is never ending, it will only get farther and farther away from the real exit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the entire army of Richard was sinister They push back slowly, frost package as knights and samurai comes in no casualties occur, they alternately fight, will keep the defense was airtight, after the defense followers stood, waiting to kill the demon slipping through the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the style of the Richard army. He pays special attention to prevent unnecessary casualties, but now the front line is retreating, the little demons seem to be endless, killing More will have the same amount to make up, have to say, this situation is the most striking morale, can not see the end of the battle, will make the most strong soldiers numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark completed the spell at this moment, and as he sipped, a black light suddenly appeared on the head of the little devil, in the black light, Clark’s scream was Thousands of times magnified, hundreds of small demons in the range of more than ten meters are standing unstable, their souls are actually shocked out of the body, and then broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the death of the divine version of the law, the power is extremely powerful, and then destroyed more than three hundred small demons, but more little devils come in, in a blink of an eye filled with a blank that is not easy to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark’s face is ugly, no more deaths are used, this is a level 9 magical skill, and his current ability can only be used three times, but the gods are not magic after all. Teacher, it consumes the power of God to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped the followers who were eager to move, and went to the direction of the little devils, standing after the formation of the knights, he took off Book of Destruction, ready to turn to the page of Scarlet Arbitration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this narrow front line of tens of meters wide, an ordinary blood color arbitration is enough to maintain the entire battlefield. If you take turns calling, you can maintain the battle line no longer. Back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of destruction absorbed the magic of Richard’s input, the pages of the book quickly turned, and the image flashed, and Richard suddenly saw the strange regular tetrahedron, somehow, The bottom of my heart gave birth to chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly hesitant, Richard turned the book of destruction back to the page where the tetrahedron was stored, and then entered the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that Richard doesn’t know why he wants to summon it, and he doesn’t know what kind of reaction he will have when he summons. He’s just vaguely feeling, this time is just four sides. The experience is different from the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fate intuition, and Richard is not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four spots flew out of the book of destruction, floating above the channel, and then they were connected in pairs, after the radiance, the mysterious glow The tetrahedron appears again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of it, Richard suddenly felt that this mysterious tetrahedron had a glimpse of an idea, as if he was asking for an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the endless little demon and responded: "kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is an almost impossible order, that is, Richard himself is not sure whether he can do it. In theory, there is always a limit to the little devil in an area in the abyss, but how many are there, but who is it? I can’t tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receiving the order of Richard, this tetrahedron began to bloom, and each of them spurred a continuous blaze of light from the four vertices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four hot rays have unimaginably high temperatures, illuminating the walls of the passage, and immediately draw a deep cut, and when they pass When the little demon, it will cut the cream like a hot knife, and cut the little devils in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four rays oscillate irregularly, but they turn all the places into a slaughterhouse, whenever a light passes through the little devil group, immediately Tens of small demons will be cut open, without flesh and blood splashes. Those cut wounds are clean and smooth mirrors, but this is not the end, but the beginning of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tetrahedron suddenly began to rotate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s tumbling completely irregular, the swing of the four ruined beams is also irregular, when the spin is combined with the rapid swing, in the eyes of the people, the four ruins The light beam is woven into a net, within a few tens of meters around the tetrahedron, and there is no dead angle, it is a country of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tetrahedron of the spin turns into a huge ball of light, and the slamming sound begins to move, then flies to the depths of the endless cloister, flying faster and faster, blinking in the blink of an eye Turning the corner, disappearing deep in the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless cloister suddenly quieted down, and it was a little bit terrible. The little devils were able to make people mad and screaming all disappeared and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is still in a fighting posture with a shield and a sword, but the enemies in front of the sword are all gone. They look at the front and almost dare not Believe in your own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground of the endless cloister, a thick layer of little devil is laid out. To be exact, it is a small devil's piece, four fast-moving destructive beams. Like the four sharpest cutters, each little demon in the passage is cut into dozens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four walls of the cloister are also covered with dense deep cuts, which are shuddering, and the walls of the cloister begin to squirm, constantly secreting dark juice. Repair the damage of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When every wound is wound, it will make a sly sound, as if something is crying in pain, at least now, it no longer dares to release small The devil is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Richard himself was shocked, but he was the first to return to God, pointing to the depths of the corridor, saying: "Go ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The thick corpses can't be cleaned up one by one. The knights simply use the heavy shield as a shovel to push the corpse of the little demon to the sides of the passage, which clears out a road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual deepening, the body of the little demon in the passage began to become sparse, and finally disappeared at the end, but only the body that was seen, Richard estimated Tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious regular tetrahedron does not know when it has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened the book of destruction and saw the tetrahedron appear on the page, but this time it was much lighter, just a ghost, Richard Try to input the power to destroy the real name inside, and the tetrahedron in the book page becomes clear again and re-rotates itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so powerful that it’s so big that Richard is not sure if he can control it, and until now, Richard’s is not clear whether it’s what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, not to delve into this matter, Richard took up the book of destruction, stepped up and ran to the depths of the endless corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was painful to be destroyed by the tetrahedron's devastating beam. The endless cloister was surprisingly honest, no small devil appeared, and even shortened the distance. Richard only walked less than a third of his estimated time and stood in front of the old bronze gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of knights in the front of the building, together, forcefully pushed open the heavy door, revealing the magnificent hall behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard stepped in, there was a thunderous roar in the hall: "Who is so bold, dare to bother me, the peace of the great abyss lord." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not scared by this loud voice. He went straight to the center of the main hall, waving his hand, following the followers, and building the knights. Stalking in, surrounded by Richard, became a battle formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last step into the hall is Tiramisu, the ogre lord lifted his big feet and directly smashed the two bronze giant doors. Obviously, it is to prevent people from being broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
