			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many nobles, especially young people, so that the number of nobles who meet the three requirements There are so many, but it is a big surprise. His last request was originally to limit the number of people. Only the children of the big family and the rudders of the side branches would have the title to inherit. The rest had the title of a knight before relying on their own ability to seal the title. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the journey, the only one of the team who did not meet the requirements of Richard was the Viscount. The strength of the 6th level of Him is indeed a landscape in the ranks, but the Viscount has the sanctuary guarding Tami, but other small aristocrats can't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aristocratic wing is well equipped and has two excellent pieces on the body. Therefore, although their number is not enough, there are no problems with ordinary enemies who face several times. In addition to the weapon armor, the aristocrats also have a variety of mounts, from hanging armor, horn deer, stepping on the fire cow, and even a black scale tiger. These special mounts are an important component of the aristocracy. Especially the center of the black scale tiger, there is no other rider dare to approach it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard appeared, the holy unicorn under his arm made all the nobles who had never seen this beast straighten their eyes! A unicorn is a sacred beast that is rarer than a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at these nobles and raised his voice. He said, "I am going to do two things this time! First, kill the dog/mother/foster. Caravan. Second, pull out the nails of all the Iron Triangle Empire. You want to fight with me, there is only one thing you need to do, see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and a knight in the follower who was covered in scarlet-painted armor. This is an elite humanoid knight with a standard wooden face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All you have to do is follow him. If he doesn't move, you won't move. Where does he go, you go with it. Just like this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a noble youth shouted: "Mr. Richard, how many troops are you going to bring? Let us level the girls!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred." Richard's answer suddenly made his screams retract into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard instigated the holy unicorn and ran outside the city of Oasis. The followers, the nobles, followed the rise of Richard, but many aristocratic youths did not have the original momentum, but became skeptical. Three hundred people want to sweep the base camp of the Iron Triangle Empire, plus the caravan? That is a caravan with 1,500 guards! But at this time, the situation has become a tiger ride, and it is hard to say that it will withdraw. Even if it is for the honor of the nobility, it cannot be withdrawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Oasis City, the three hundred iron rides have been waiting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom knew that Richard’s cavalry was elite, but when he saw the three hundred iron rides, he still sucked in a cold air! These three hundred knights are all the same equipment, shining from the head to the feet with a touch of magic. Are these knights all fine-level magical equipment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early someone’s eyes fell on the weapons of the Three Knights, which were three hundred long-handled rifle axes! Such heavy weapons rarely appear on the cavalry. Their killing power is too fierce, so it is extremely difficult to transport. Three hundred thorn guns and axe also swayed the brilliance of magic, but it was also excellent equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred armed men who were armed to the teeth saw Richard, and they instigated the horses, followed the followers, and went with Richard. When the three hundred knights passed by, a lot of keen aristocrats suddenly chilled. Because they did not feel a trace of anger from these knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the three hundred knights, the knight of scarlet armor instigated the horse and kept up with the team. Behind him, the aristocratic youths have been rushing to form a noisy team to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that this rush was a whole day! At night, the team is 500 kilometers away from Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finally stopped the unicorn and ordered a rest on the spot, the noble youths planted them on horseback, and many people lay down on the ground. I don’t even want to move a finger. Many of them may have good strengths, but endurance is far from being an opponent of Richard's edgy followers, and it is unlikely to rival the Brood War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked in the middle of the nobility in the east and said faintly: "Two hours off, two hours later, prepare for the battle. The enemy is ten kilometers away." Camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a while?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble youths are crying and crying, and most of them are still lying on the ground, calling their own soldiers to massage their legs and feet. There were several aristocratic youths who supported the climb and grabbed their own weapons and began to do pre-war inspections. How many of them participated in several battles in the vertical line, and he was more excited and excited. Q: "What kind of enemy is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carrefour of Earl of Lambert." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great! Let's kill them!" Hem excitedly jumped up. The aristocratic youth who couldn’t stand up stood face to face, and then they focused their anger on Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chubby viscount is not working in the first 100 kilometers, and the back is completely sitting on Tami’s shoulder, which is comparable to bumps. The saddle is smooth and comfortable. But they feared the power of Him, and they only dared to glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours, only enough for them to breathe. And the three hundred knights have dismounted, sitting directly on the ground, taking out food and water bags, and began to eat silently. Their food is very simple, it is a large piece of dried meat, chewed and then washed down with water. Looking at a piece of meat with a few pounds of weight, the smaller and smaller the knights in the hands of the knights, until they disappear, the nobles are discolored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, the camp of the Earl of Lambert was quiet, and most of the people and soldiers had fallen asleep. The guards of the caravan vigils have 300 soldiers, and the people who sleep are all dressed and lying, and the weapons are all within easy reach. At this moment, the vigil of the vigil suddenly felt that the earth under his feet seemed to tremble slightly, and then the tremors became more and more dramatic. On the horizon of the night, a row of black shadows appeared. The shadows are quickly approaching and getting clearer! Apparently a row of cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams rang through the night sky and then stopped . A lanced tomahawk ran across and directly harvested the head of the sentinel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight, such as a moving steel barrier, smashed the fence around the camp and crushed it from the center of the camp! After the three hundred iron rides regrouped, they rushed into the camp from another direction and began to let go. They shine with layers of magic and magic, and the tomahawks are the life harvesters. The enemy's counterattacks are so weak and weak that even their magic armor is difficult to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A humanoid knight suddenly flew out with a horse, and immediately lit up a very dazzling vindictiveness in the center of the caravan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctuary Strong! Such a caravan, there is a hidden sanctuary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic youth who watched the war in the distance saw the heart sway, but Heim was not afraid, because he also had a sanctuary guard around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the stalwart of the Sanctuary’s strongman just shines in the night sky, and suddenly several figures are encircled, it is Richard and followers! A bolt of lightning descended from the sky, squatting on the vindictive light, and then the various magical or magical radiances that were smashed or bursting drowned the sacred sacred temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard and his followers spread out to the four sides and continue to fight the soldiers who resisted. On the battlefield just now, a tall figure swayed and finally crashed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Heim, who has experienced the battle of meat grinders, can’t believe his eyes, a sanctuary, is killed like this, so simple? How much time did the battle just take, is there a minute? Hem looked at Tami around him, and for the first time felt that his ingenious body now seems less reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is coming to an end. Those who do not know how to lead are still deeply immersed in the terrible horror of Richard and his followers to kill the sanctuary in an instant, knowing that leading the soldiers is even more shocked by the three hundred iron rides. These knights are completely machines for killing, the movements are simple and effective, and the equipment advantage is so desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent of the same level, to fight all the way to the frontal hit, it is possible to break the armor of the humanoid knight, and the humanoid knight swept away, regardless of the enemy Whatever you wear, you can cut it with an ax. If such a knight is only a few dozen, it is okay, but now there are three hundred! When the three hundred iron riders gather together, it is not two or three times the enemy can block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, the three hundred knights did not die. In his hand, Li has a very extravagant sect of the gods, and the wounded warrior just wants to die. The caravans were completely annihilated, and the guards either died or fell. All the goods fell in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble youths, together with the guards, were unscathed and fought throughout the battle. They all fought in the distance from the battlefield and watched Richard lead him. The knight slaughtered several times the enemy. Richard has always emphasized the military discipline. The elite knight did not move, and the nobles could not move. They could only watch. Even if there were a few uneasy points, they were also stopped by the battles in the vertical line. Even if they had never seen it before, they heard the family members talk about the Thunder means of Li Liwei when the coalition forces just integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Richard handed over the goods of the caravan to the cracked stone camp, he rushed all the way to the northeast, and ran three hundred a day. Kilometers, without a break, directly smashed a camp belonging to the Iron Triangle Empire, and all five hundred defenders in the camp died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rest of the night, when the day was still not bright, Richard led the army to another camp in a hundred kilometers away, with a total of four hundred defenders. Then the troops slowed down and rushed to another slave camp...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
