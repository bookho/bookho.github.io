			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This equipment looks like a different army, but on the battlefield They showed quite amazing fighting power. They cooperated with each other, and the formation was strict. They surrounded the barbarian tribes and then patiently used the rifles or bows to force the barbarian warriors to retreat and stab one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the army, a commander’s sword pointed to the sky, and the horn sounded immediately, and the soldiers immediately stepped back a few big steps, and the two sides were separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander yelled at the surrounded barbarian tribe: "Now surrender, I can guarantee that the elderly and children have civilian treatment in the Crimson Principality, all Adult men and women need to serve fifteen years of hard labor or military service, and have the right to redeem freedom. You can think about it. I will give you a minute. If you refuse to surrender, then all of you will be reduced to lifelong slaves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commander is wearing a black armor, and the armor is wrapped in a thick cloak, but her voice is crisp and sweet, although it is murderous, but still It was very comfortable to listen to, she covered her face with a towel, leaving only a pair of eyes exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the battlefield, nearly 100 bodies have been fallen, mostly on the side of the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a sorcerer’s old man came out of the tribe and came to the commander, sighing deeply and slamming On behalf of the entire tribe, said that the surrender, the soldiers around the deep red Principality burst into a burst of cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another crisp victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrender of this tribe means that a large fortune is credited, and every soldier will have something to gain, the old man and the child are the care of the barbarians, they are The deep red male domestic life needs to be supported by the barbarians of hard labor or military service. Adult barbarians, both men and women, are excellent fighters, so most of them will choose to perform military service. In the human kingdom, the barbarian guards are welcomed by the nobility. So I can sell a good price, and with the elderly and children behind, their loyalty is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barbarian tribe now has more than half of the soldiers alive, and if they die, they will drag a lot of soldiers from the deep red Principality to go on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander jumped off the horse and watched the subordinates skillfully clean the battlefield and compile the barbarian warrior. She pulled the face towel down to reveal a young and delicate face. A mage brushed her on the paper for a while. Said: "The adult of Sosrel, after deducting the funds that the soldiers deserve, this time the income is about 13,000 gold coins. The money for the Sartre brothers will be used. With them, we are here. The action will be easier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler indulged and said, "But the money can also buy a hundred high endurance highlands. The horse has the same effect, I will consider it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Highland horses can be bought at any time, but excellent parade shooters like the Sartre brothers Very few, their reconnaissance ability is very popular." The Master advised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler is quite a bit heart-warming, but it’s still a little early to make a decision. It’s time to send people to bring these barbarian warriors back to the strongholds. How many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her face suddenly changed slightly, and a veteran around him simply fell to the ground, listened for a while, jumped and said: "About a dozen The cavalry is all heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many dozens of heavy rides will appear on the ancestral highlands, the terrain of the ancestral highlands is complex, the climate is bad, and the temperature difference between day and night is extremely high. Large, often can not find a source of water within a hundred kilometers, so the environment is not suitable for heavy cavalry activities, the only exception may be Richard's 黯 骑士 knight, and the humanoid knight specially developed for the ancestral highlands, But these two are the core arms of Richard, and they will only be assigned to their followers, and it is impossible to reach her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of visitors is small, Sosler immediately summoned the soldiers, laying a line of defense on the periphery, and the light cavalry all on the horse, in the magic and In the magical world, there are too many ways to cover up the military's shape. The sound is more than a dozen heavy rides, but in fact it may be more than a hundred light cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, there was a small group of knights in the distance. After seeing the people, all the soldiers were relieved because of the horrible black armor. The tall magic riders are the symbols of the Knights of the Sui Feng. In the army of Richard, the elite knights have a special status. They are not only the main force of attacking the strong, but also often shoulder the heavy responsibility of conveying the order of Richard. When they came to the front line, the movement orders of the various units were conveyed by the elite knights. In the eyes of others, these silent knights were deeply trusted by Richard, and they never betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ordinary human warriors, they will have some vague fears for the knights. On the battlefield, the bodies of the war knights have clearly indicated that they are just appearances, and the inner structure is completely different from human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler sighed and let the soldiers put in the squadrons, and the headed elite squadron went straight to Sosrel. Dismissed the ceremony and said: "The general of Sosrel, General Gangde sent me a message, the general said that Richard has just returned to Faro, has been to all followers, Sanctuary strong, big magician and all The commander who commanded more than 3,000 people issued a summoning order. The people within the order of the order went to Oasis City within one month. The general said that you also have the qualification to be called, so that you can get back to Oasis City as soon as possible. Your troops can Withdrew to a nearby stronghold until the new order came down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler asked a few more questions and watched the Knights Far go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood for a while, thinking repeatedly: "I am also a person who has been called."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the collection is extraordinary. Anyone who can be listed on the convening list belongs to the core scope of Richard. Sosler was compensated by the Schumpeter family to Richard. After being sent to Faro, Richard almost forgot that there was such a woman. She only had a few hundred gold coins in her hand. She pulled up a small team of more than a dozen people and started a career similar to a mercenary. The time was in a hurry. Now Sosler has established a team of more than 2,000 people. Now she is also involved in the development of the ancestral highlands, exchanged trophies for gold coins and equipment, and hired more soldiers and talents. Then she carried out a larger-scale operation, and she has been steadily playing like this, like snowballing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process of growing up, Gangde has a lot of power behind her, and in the sale of loot and hired soldiers, Sosler has never Not being martyrdom of the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler sighed softly and looked at his team. The confidants around him heard the words of the Knights of the Front, all It’s a surprise. Sosler understands their thoughts. This unit has never been a regular force in the Crimson Principality. It is similar to the nature of half mercenary and half-public. If you can enter it yourself. The core scope of Richard, then they will even be promoted with status, and even have the opportunity to be incorporated into the regular legion of the Chonghong Principality. The regular military of the Chonghong Principality is known for its well-equipped and well-guaranteed mainland, and the variety and quantity of replenishment There are even some extravagant tastes. If you don’t say anything else, the rich military squad is twice as high as Sosrel can give them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to the content of the recall order of Richard, Sosler has not yet reached the threshold of Richard's request. Gangde informed her to go, and gave her a guarantee in her own fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt a little boring, simply took off the helmet, let the black hair covered, and took a few deep breaths, saying: "We withdraw the stronghold Then I am going to Oasis City. When I am not there, the whole army is stationed in the stronghold and does not come to war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is exported, people around suddenly Cheering up, she was also somewhat surprised. From my heart, Sosrel didn't want to go, at least not yet, but even if she had to follow her long-time warriors, she had to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue water oasis city, Richard ended his routine meditation. This is the third day he came to Faro. Today he is going to see a special People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the magic zone and walked to a quiet courtyard on the back side of the lab. The courtyard was small, but there were only four or five in a wooden building. The room, the small building door is not locked, Richard gently pushes open the door and walks into the living room. The living room of this small building has been transformed into a library with rows of bookshelves and a reading table in the corner. Scattered manuscripts were piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over and picked up a manuscript, looked at it for a while, put it down, and then picked up a look, so unconsciously, It took a full half hour for Richard to read all the manuscripts. These manuscripts were all cluttered with data and line-by-line formulas. There were many abstract figures in between, but in the master of such a structure. In the eyes, the contents of these manuscripts are linked together. The people who left these manuscripts actually want to improve the design of a structure, and the improvement is still a basic functional unit, and they want to improve the most basic functional units. It's not that simple, it requires a lot of basic calculations and genius ideas. We must know that each functional unit has been revised and perfected for hundreds of years. It doesn't know how many Nolan's legendary masters have gathered their work. It tends to be perfect and it is easier to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard found out from the manuscript that the above is a new design concept, and derived many algorithms, follow this path It is very likely to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep in the hallway, an old man came in. He saw Richard, first, and then it was incredible: Richard, how come you suddenly came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
