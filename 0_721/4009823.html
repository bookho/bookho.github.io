			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the mother’s large abdomen squirmed and gave birth to three consecutive More than one meter tall eggs. This time the egg shell is a light cyan semi-rigid shell. As soon as the green egg landed, it began to vibrate. In the blink of an eye, the power-type fast-moving beast inside the shell broke out. The three-headed beasts swallowed the eggshells for the first time and then stood by their nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that there were three more perceptual points in consciousness, and there was a feeling of coldness. This is the consciousness of the three beasts, and they have been associated with Richard since birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come here." Richard tried to give them orders, and the three beasts immediately ran to his side, staring at a pair of small amber eyes. Richard, constantly spurting out of his nostrils with a strong sour breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strength-enhanced beast is much taller than the common beast, and when they are straight, they are almost as high as Richard. The blade that is close to one meter is large and heavy, and it is smashed by it. The damage is probably not much lighter than the one that the elite veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Turning, stopping, accelerating, slamming..." Richard continuously commands in consciousness, and these beasts are executed one by one, which is very easy to control. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is also because of the small number, if the number of beasts reaches more than 100, then Richard can't control it anyway. And now, Richard has faintly felt that in the near future, the number of beasts may be hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the mother nest, Richard did not know how to deal with it. The current mother's nest is only moving at a speed of five kilometers per hour, and it is difficult to participate in the expected attack. However, as long as it is within the attack range of the mother's nest, its individual combat power can be said to be the most powerful. It is the resurrection of Sir Mintel. As long as the mother's nest is squirting acid, it is also dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I can stay here. You take the beast away, they will be your most loyal warrior." The mother's nest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, what about your security?" Richard is still worried about his mother's nest. After seeing the beast, he now has the most intuitive understanding of the importance of the nest. To put it simply, the mother's nest can't be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, don't worry about me, there are no enemies nearby, only food. I have nine worker bees as guards, and tomorrow, I will have new ones. The beast is a guard. It is more important that you destroy the enemy. The wisdom of war that I understand is that after all the enemies are destroyed, it is naturally safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded, reached out and patted the mother's nest, and hurriedly left with three beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning of the next day, Richard summoned all the men, and looked at each other’s faces one by one, then said, “We are here. This strange plane, all the advance personnel disappeared, and we have experienced two bloody battles, lost three brothers, almost everyone was injured! Now, we are the guys who give these girls It’s time to take a trip!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is clear and powerful, and his determination and strength are unquestionable, but perhaps because the face with the elves is too beautiful. There is always less majesty and murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pre-war declaration is still quite good, it is much better than the first time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde touched the short hair with a steel needle and praised: "This swearing is really good, the head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a shame and a tear, and the impassioned brewing that was brewed out is completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This counterattack is crucial, and Richard carefully prepared the battle plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the famous battles of history, almost all famous players will mobilize their troops before the war to motivate morale and gain more powerful combat power. Although Richard has only a dozen people plus three beasts and a mother's nest, it is also equivalent to a small army. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize before the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard knows that if he wants to go back alive, he must learn to lead the battle. So after a few days of busy work, he will try his best to recall and analyze the historical warfare and famous biographies he has seen, trying to find out where everything can be learned. However, ninety-nine of the hundred books he has read are related to magic. The wars and history are so poor that they are temporarily replenished after the arrival of Faust, and naturally there is not much information for reference. Therefore, Richard’s first carefully prepared pre-war mobilization failed unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard couldn’t help but think of Gordon. The man who is arrogant and rough has always had an inexplicable charm, and he does not deliberately make it, but makes people No matter what he does with him, he has extra confidence. Just like the night road that sacrificed that night, as long as you see the back of Gotton, you will become calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard’s face was a little embarrassed, Gangde laughed a few times and said, “Hey, in fact, you don’t have to tell us so much, these people I know. If you want us to follow you, you should be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly made a fist and slammed the table in front of the thick planks On the top, revealing the fierce light, screamed: "Give me the help of his mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is crying and laughing, asking: "How?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you want to do it!" Gangde answered with a natural answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said very seriously: "But before you fight a battle, you have to figure out the shape of the battlefield, the enemy's general strength, and set the battle plan!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, don't you think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard wants to say, but was interrupted by Gangde: "Since you have thought about it, of course, what do you want?" How did it work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very helpless, took a deep breath, calmed down and said: "But my decision It’s not necessarily right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde said awkwardly: “No, head, your decision is the most correct decision! You don’t have to be humble, on the battlefield. The situation is grasped, no one here can match you. A few days ago, your command is simply God. Whenever I can’t support it, you can always appear, not help me. Put, that is Ms. Liu sand came to a treatment. At that time, the face of Minta’s old man was wonderful! There is more than one for me, so, head, you are a natural general, and now it’s just shining!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s face was red and white, he did reverse the situation on the battlefield again and again. But that's not because of the mastery of the art of war, but because of the data-oriented vision brought by the precise talent, you can instantly judge from a small number of people who can't support it, so as to rush to support it. On the other hand, it is because Richard can perceive the position of the person who signed the soul guard contract and the magic slavery contract with him. Therefore, the battlefield, especially the small-scale local battlefield, is basically translucent in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined power of these two capabilities interacts, and with a little bit of luck, but also with the support of the sand and strong magic, it creates a miracle The result of the battle. Therefore, Richard really can't tell whether Gangde is really sincere, or is he used to praise the superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gangde is still not finished, and added: "In particular, the final decision to let us embrace it is simply a demeanor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the famous and the legendary mage, the street gangsters are more skilled and handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Richard Chaweng, Gang Deqi was pleased to ask: "Hey, if you want to mobilize before the war, you have to tell us the purpose of the war, and What can we get after winning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is very good, and Richard immediately said: "Of course it is to return to Noland!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Gangde shrugged and said: "Returning to Noland is not necessarily better than staying in this position. And to be honest, this goal is too far away. You have to tell us a little bit of immediate, immediate, and tangible benefits. You don't need too much, and you don't need to have much benefit. For example, in the death camp, I can win the man by winning the man. If you can win the woman, you can take her for a good night. If you can make the first sign, you can get two more medicines. You see, it's that simple, but absolutely effective."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s words, let Richard ponder. Just as he thought about it, Gangde suddenly screamed and slammed, jumped over the table and flashed to the other side of the hall. The seemingly bold and strong Gangde, in fact, speed and flexibility is no less than the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, everyone’s eyes fell on Gangde, but the guy’s face was obviously as amazing as his physique, and he stood without a problem. As usual, as if nothing happened, even giving people an illusion, he has been standing in that position, never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let him be so rude, of course, nothing really happened. Just when Gangde said that, a bit of acupuncture-like killings fell on his lumbar spine and then moved down. Only in the face of a real crisis, Gangde’s intuition will show the police, and the murder is so familiar. He did not think at all. The body completely followed the instinct and immediately reached the other side of the hall to stay away from danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuihua holding her guide to the eternal sleep, slightly bowed, eyes half-closed, as if nothing happened. Just a few days away from the death camp, she now learns to disguise herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little episode is active in the atmosphere, and it just dissolves Richard’s embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Richard learned the way of Gangde and slammed a punch on the table. This punch has already looked a bit like it, although it is still more refined and more unconstrained. However, it is really difficult for a strong man to be a bold and unrestrained constructor who is as accurate as a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
