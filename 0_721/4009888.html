			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilke has nearly half of the fighters not appearing, but because of his The cavalry who had escaped from the death message was sent out in time, and it was far from the fact that the fire dragon that came from the direction of the city had turned back halfway. It seems that it is unlikely that his remnants will continue to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, more than 80 knights led by Strick are close to the whole army, and the remaining captains come with the same knights. It is sent to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to patrol around the camp while assigning the task: "Clean the battlefield! Treat the wounds, bring all the prisoners together, drag the bodies, and gather the horses." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in every order, the battlefield data is also counted out, a total of 16 prisoners, more than 50 intact horses, 11 people escaped More than sixty dead. On the other hand, Richard killed three soldiers and five half-orcs, and another dozen were injured. There are drifting sands, as long as they are not killed on the spot, or disabled with broken hands, they can be rescued and resume their fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical contractors who are the core strengths are not involved in the cleanup of the battlefield work, but on the spot to rest treatment, in order to restore combat effectiveness as soon as possible. It is not only necessary to guard against the second wave of attacks in the city, but also to defend the surrounding camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many good birds in the camps, and there are many people who want to be cheap. However, Richard has just achieved victory over an overwhelming advantage, and the surrounding camps do not understand the details of Richard. For the time being, I do not know how much interest can be plotted. After watching the battle just now, I have to figure out if I can shake this hard bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the body has been fully checked, how to deal with it?" A stepping knight came over to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and said: "Ordinary warriors are dressed on wooden stakes and erected next to the camp! The five captains’ bodies are collected and handed over to Shande. Lu. As for Strick...Sandru!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you have to order?" is busy sending the wounded black warrior into the summoning circle. The necromancer did not raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have an important use of Stich's body. It is not a problem to get on the stake for a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru was taken aback and then said helplessly: "If you have done it beforehand, you can still be converted into a warrior. But the strength will be two levels lower than the black warrior. If it is now His body is given to me, maybe I might summon a death knight out." To be honest, his reaction to the expression of Richard's sentence and his expression almost did not seem to be a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, who has seen the black warrior combat power, does not have much fantasies about the death knight. So when I saw Shanru send the Black Warrior back to the summoning plane, he immediately said, "You have 30 minutes to deal with Strick's body, but you are not allowed to spend his face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru's so-called treatment, in fact, is to extract residual soul fragments from the **, and inject the death energy into the ** to maintain the body's vitality. In just a few minutes, the Undead Master completed the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So half an hour later, on the open space outside the camp, there were dozens of wooden stakes, each of which was nailed with a stripped armor. The body. The center is three times higher than the others, and Stick is hanging. Around the open space, dozens of torches were inserted to illuminate Stick and his men. Richard took care of the needs of the Necromancer, or else he was ready to cut off the hands and feet of Strick's body and hang it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, I don’t know how many eyes saw this horrible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camps that are ready to go are quiet, and the large torches that were originally gathered in the city are gradually dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just want these guys to see clearly, what is the person who wants to kill me!" said Richard, who was far away from the city, and then he waved Said: "It seems that there will be nothing tonight, sleep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard got into his tent and rested. Gangde stood on a clearing, bare upper body, washing his wound with a bucket of water. Strong and powerful muscles and magic lines on the right chest and shoulders are full of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to the tent, Gangde only stroked his chin and said thoughtfully: "The head is getting more and more ferocious!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet didn’t know when it’s coming over, he agreed with the nod, and then felt deeply, in a very lyrical tone: “Every ferocious Behind the leader, there are at least two ferocious women standing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde nodded hard: "This is a bit reasonable! Who said?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the Elf poet let Gangde look disappointed, if it is a famous name in history There is still some philosophy in the voice of the big man, and the elf poet’s own words are too little to be convincing. However, his thoughts in his huge head suddenly turned, and he said, "Two ferocious women... Do you provoke water and sand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral The face immediately became a bit ugly. Then Gangde’s eyes changed, not curious, ironic or gloating, but deep sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one?" asked Gangde. He does not believe that the two elf poets and two women dare to provoke, if he did, it is obviously not standing here intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral hesitated for a long time before saying: "...sweet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gund Shrug, said: "Why don't you find sand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water flower seems to mean something to me, and there is obviously no sand. In addition, the test of water spray is most affected. She won't kill me. But it's sanding... She wants to kill me, there seems to be a lot of ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly smart!" Gangde praised, then A pair of Oral hooked up and lowered the voice and asked: "How do you 'get provoke' of water, say in detail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel One arm is worth two arms of the Elf poet, and the power is at least three or four times that of the Elf poet. In the steel-like arm, Oral was almost breathless. He understood that this was a threat of nakedness. If you don’t say it, Gangde would never be polite, and he ran over to find Gangde. I want to find someone to talk about the depression and depression in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I touched my ass..." Oral squeezed the sentence out of his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Touched the bottom of the ass? Really touched?" Gangde’s eyes were very bright and full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Elf poet still let Gangde be disappointed, although disappointment is expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is no truth, just a finger touched a little, just..." Although it is only a small gain, it is still a little bit of a harvest, still let the elf poet remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then?" Gangde is looking forward to asking more sympathetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then..." The Elf poet smiled and said, "Then, I know the real use of her steel."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangdehaha laughed, looked like electricity, swept up and down the elf poet, and slammed his shoulder and said: "Know the purpose of the steel vertebra, you can stillnight Standing here, and the strength is not weak, is it secretly looking for Miss Sands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral body involuntarily trembled and nodded Then, in a very heavy tone, "I was only able to walk barely when I was hurt. If I didn't want to be discovered by the owner, and I didn't leave my trouble, I would only go to Miss Liu. But... for the whole night, she only gave I used a treatment for minor injuries!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes couldn’t help but jump a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of healing are similar, and the healing of wounds is accelerated by divine power, but the effect is different. The same is true for the treatment of minor injuries, which accelerates the growth of blood in the wound and accelerates healing. It's just that this process is often painful. In the plane of advocating war and violence, injury is a sign of men, and repression is the basics of men. Therefore, no qualified warrior will call the pain when he is treated by the magical technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Oral’s injury is definitely enough to be treated with strong treatment, and the sand is consistently used to treat minor injuries. In this way, at least twenty or thirty treatments are needed for micro-injury. The duration of treatment lasts for several hours. During the period when the magic continues to take effect, the pain of Oral is multiplied by the bloody movement of the wound. . Moreover, the Elf poet is not sure whether the sand will secretly give him some magical ability to strengthen his perception during the treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural watched the process of examining the prisoners by Richard and the quicksand, and thought of the situation in which the sand was quietly applied to the prisoner. He shudders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde coughed and patted Oral’s shoulder and said with sympathy: “You are scared!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not as frightening as it is! You don’t understand that feeling!” The fairy poet suddenly got excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, look at what your experience really deserves sympathy. I will give you another advice. Don't think too much about water." "Gangde said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shuihua?" Oral glimpsed, in his eyes, the girl is acting by strength and instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about it, why does the splash make your finger touch her? If she doesn't mean it, you definitely have no chance. You have ten hands. She can cut it one by one!" Gangde hinted at it meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral began to seep out cold sweat: "Is it because...I want to make it impossible for me to complain to the owner? After all, I am doing it first..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde opened his mouth and said, "You touched a finger, she still has a steel vertebra, isn’t it fair?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
