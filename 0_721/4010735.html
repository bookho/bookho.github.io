Gangde and Tiramisu go for a run, bring fifty costume knights and five hundred knights, I will send you the stars and one hundred flying dragonflies. You have three days to kill one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde opened his mouth and smiled: "No problem, head."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu muttered dissatisfiedly: "I hate the stars and hate Gangde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang Xiaodao said: "Xing Hao has just risen a step, now take you to heaven, you do not need to keep using floating, as for Gangde, so, choose one of the three dukes to command, how." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu opened his mouth: "This is almost the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangement After the military service, Richard suddenly received the information of the mother's nest: "Master, you have Is St. package as a teacher "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Yes, "Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the Holy Builder, even if you look at the entire Nolande is the top character, since this is the case, Master, I think we need to see one side, Have a good talk, I hope to see you soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between Richard and the mother's nest has always been through the soul, now with a brain As a relay, the distance of communication is greatly extended. In theory, as long as the number of brains is enough, Richard and the mother nest can communicate at infinity, but the farther away, the more the number of docking nodes in the middle, the delay of communication The longer it is, but at the moment they are thousands of kilometers apart, there is absolutely no need to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard thought about it, he promised: "Well, I will leave in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The brain has been prepared for you along the way." The mother's nest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying speed of the brain is quite fast, and the speed is more than 150 kilometers per hour, far exceeding the large beasts such as the Griffin and the Wyvern. It's slower than some dragons, and they can keep flying at this speed for three hours, which makes them more capable of escape, and can also be used as a special means of transportation in emergencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, we will be able to meet soon." Richard responded faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The linear distance between Richard and the mother's nest is more than 5,000 kilometers. After lunch, Richard will board the flying brain, which is coming to the turbulent The ground quickly flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About four hundred kilometers, a new brain splits up and takes over the brain that is going to exhaust, with Richard to the turbulent The land is going away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later, it was a new brain splitting on the road. In these arrangements, the mother nest is also dripping, with the help of the huge size of the talent, currently The computing power of the nest is a whole higher than that of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the brain, Richard closed his eyes and raised his mind, and did not think about the meeting in this consciousness, but constantly analyzed the metal rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand the basic metal rules, the greater the power of the king of metals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of the metal contained in the soul fragments left by the King of Iron is limited, however, in the battle against the King of Iron and the Son of Kim, no face twice to Li Among the war madmen inspecting Canada, there is a large amount of information on metal rules, which gives Richard a temporary ability to control metal rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the war madness's ability subsided, Richard forcibly recorded a large number of rules, now it is confirmed by the rules of the war madman and the king of iron, let Richard’s control over the metal rules has advanced by leaps and bounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ichao estimates that it takes only seven days to complete the analysis of the original three or five years, so as to directly reach the stage of controlling the rules, and then seven days, even Without the king of metal, Richard can also control the metal, but the level will drop, probably just the degree of control, far from the king of metal, the superiority of the weapons and the erosion of the two powerful capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you keep flying, it takes more than a day to reach the turbulent place. During these times, Richard didn’t think about anything, just like this. Dedicated to the rules, all the way to the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current turbulent land is more mysterious and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of kilometers of worm nest forests, and those forests look the same as ordinary trees, but in fact the underground roots are linked Together, they are closely connected to a worm nest. The roots of the forest are now hundreds of meters deep, and they continue to draw energy from the depths of the plane to supply more than a dozen worm nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking far away, we can still find the environment of the nest forest is very different, the black air in the forest is constantly rising, affecting the light, so the entire forest landscape in the field of vision is constantly twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the nest forest, the time stream is extraordinarily much, almost reflecting the entire sky, the density is almost several times that of Richard’s first turbulent land. The time streamers and the black gas rising from the nest forest are intertwined, and they will entangle each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, anything that encounters the time streamer will be smothered and smothered, but the blackness of the nest forest seems to affect the time streamer. And even constantly pulling them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard saw this scene, he specifically let the brain stay in the air for a moment. In the real field of view, Richard saw the area of ​​the turbulent land. The spatial structure is becoming more fragile, and the crystal wall is already unable to block the erosion of the space-time storm, so it will produce a large number of time streamers. The reason why the space becomes fragile is naturally because of the mother nest and its nest forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of combat regiments require massive amounts of energy, which are extracted from the depths of the world by the nest forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking far away, you can see an incomparably tall worm nest in the middle of the forest. It looks like a spiral, and the top is a huge platform. The nest of the worm is more than three hundred meters, and the top platform is huge, so large that the nest can be comfortably placed on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is carrying Lichafei near the nest platform. When viewed from a close, the mother's nest is 500 meters long and nearly 100 meters high. The body looks very large, and the volume is just a sense of breathlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest raised his upper body and waved the pair of ridiculous blades, saying: "Master, very happy to see you again, this meeting It is very important to me, I think it is very important to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee jumped from the brain, stood on the platform, looked up at the mother The nest, the contrast between the two sides, is like an elephant standing in front of an ant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the mother's nest, looking from his point of view, the mother's nest in the hundreds of compound eyes is constantly shining, the light is flowing, as if to express Countless kinds of anthropomorphic thoughts are drowning the most real emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the soul seems to be snoring, and Richard feels that somewhere in his heart is suddenly empty. It seems that something that has been with him for a long time has disappeared. He has a feeling that in fact the thing has disappeared for a while, but it has been The things that were simulated were covered up, and now is the time when the truth is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said slowly: "Actually, you don't have to call me a master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is from the level of soul constraints, it is really unnecessary." The answer to the mother's nest is surprisingly refreshing, and it is not communicated with the soul, the mouth is swaying, and a syllable clearly sings out in the air. That is the Norland human lingua franca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "When I got you from the altar of the Eternal and Time Dragon, it was not said that." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any rule is omission, and the eternal and time dragon is not omnipotent. If you have the heart, you can find countless in its rules. The omissions." Speaking of this, the mother's nest paused, and said with emotion: "Norland's human beings are really daring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the nest In general, Richard always felt that he had heard it before, and recalled it carefully. He remembered that this was the famous saying of the scholars of the Solomon Fortress. However, the system of the mother's nest itself was completely a war machine. Richard also knew that he did not give it to the mother. The information on this aspect of the nest, then it can be quite interesting to know this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shen Shen said: "You cut off the soul constraint between me and you"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not cutting off, it’s finishing my soul. I now have a complete soul. I don’t have to rely on your soul to exist.” The mother’s nest corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether Li’s mind is turbulent or not, at least the face is very calm. If he has nothing to ask, how can he do the soul repair? This is any strong person. Very interested in the topic, and the answer to the nest is surprisingly careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was hooked up with interest and raised more in-depth questions. The mother’s nest also answered in full, no concealment, both sides answered questions, unconsciously It was dark, then the sky was bright again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard has an understanding of the soul-filling plan. From a mage’s point of view, this plan is called grandiose, everywhere The amazing wisdom flash, it can never be done by a certain individual, but more like the result of the continuous improvement of the great scholars of Solomon for generations, the wisdom of the entire Solomon Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
