			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard walked out of the meditation room, the girl opened her eyes again, from ' The bed 'jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl's 'bed' is actually three long swords, inserting the hilt into the ground, the sword front up, three points sharp sword front, is her bed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever Richard meditates, the splash will sleep on the sword front, which is the way she thinks herself, to stay the most between rest and alertness. The balance is good, always let myself be in a dangerous underground, gradually tempering and improving the control of the fineness of the body. When she was in the training camp, she often stayed at the end of the branch. Now it’s just because it’s simple. Just sleeping on the sword front, the difficulty is of course higher than that of the year. I don’t know how many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Richard, the girl suddenly took a step back, and the huge pressure that swept through the moment touched her defense instinct and even crossed the soul link. The sense of security, then the water is only realized, the eyes filled with a deep surprise, called: "You are already a big magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes I don't think I have to wait any longer." Richard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, is that the case..." The girl’s face turned dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly understood her mind in a blink of an eye, smiled and licked her head and said, "Don't think about it, pick up things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The girl is as good as a cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things of Richard are very simple. In fact, there are only one big one and two small magic boxes, one is a sacrifice and the other is a Richard. The structure that is drawn at leisure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and the girl walked side by side to the central area of ​​the fortress. They met many Sanctuary strongmen along the way and greeted them enthusiastically. Pay tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gatekeeper is a big man with a hard-faced beard. This is the fortress’s few savage heavenly sanctuary. He sees Richard. When I came over, I said intimately, "Is Richard, do you want to go back to Noland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I am ready to go back. I have been here for a long time." Richard smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I will start the portal. As for the other procedures, let us avoid it." This man skillfully started the portal and waited for it. After the safety information that came back from the opposite side, he waved his hand to Richard. The Dahan didn't look back until the figure of Richard and the water flower disappeared completely in the magic light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately put the alarm device of the portal back to his position, but the eyebrows wrinkled more and more tightly, and I always felt that something was wrong. "Weird, how do you think that today seems to be somewhat different from the past, and it makes me feel a little bit afraid. Oh, it used to be like this... It’s not right, today it feels extraordinarily strong. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Han grabbed his head and continued to think: "How could this be, but a big magician only... the big magician, he is already The great magister, "”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan was surprised to open his mouth, he has been in the field for a long time, and his position is naturally concerned about Richard. This kind of identity is a special character, and Richard’s business is not a secret. As long as you pay attention, you can always find out, so Dahan began to pull his fingers to count the time of Richard’s battle in the absolute field, one year, two years. Three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan’s forehead immediately began to see sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha actually stayed here for three years before becoming a big magician, the last time someone suppressed three years of strength, when is it, Dahan Looking back hard, I found that I didn’t seem to be able to find a precedent. Maybe it happened before a long time ago, maybe there is such a person, but it is not in the dusk. In short, in the memory of the big man, there is no such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusk of the land to suppress the power for so long, it is a miracle not to die, here even the ordinary sanctuary does not dare to easily get out of the fortress's defense range, not to mention People who have not yet reached this level of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan immediately thought of his instincts, fear, yes, it was really fear, and Richard just became a big magician and he felt fear, Dahan Suddenly I felt that my face was a little hot. He was also recognized as a sanctuary by the people. How could he be afraid of a guy who had just become a big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately remembered that it seemed that when Richard was not a great magister, he had quietly included Richard in the list of unwilling to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I just respect that he is a builder, but I am not really afraid of him." The big man wanted to convince himself and aggravated his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly heard a voice in his ear: "Hey, brother, what's wrong, what is the builder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan discovered that he did not know when he stood three people in front of him. One of them was a little bit sympathetic with him. He realized that he had thought too much about it, and he gave his heart to him without knowing it. Speaking of it, his face suddenly red and purple, and the face of the big man sank, Shen Sheng said: "You come here, what do you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sanctuary looked strange and said: "Go back to Noland, I have been here for more than two months, and I need to go back and have a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, register first, then wait for the review. If you get the reply back, I will inform you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Registration, this... still needs Registration. "The three are all at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." The big man's face was as black as the bottom of the pot, and he slammed a stack of magic paper in front of the three people, saying: "Everybody two Ten sheets must be filled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three face each other, and then smiled for the first person: "Brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan’s face is as hard as a stone sculpture: “Brothers are useless, this is the rule, fill out the form, and then wait for the notice, otherwise you will go to other fortresses.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current special circumstances of the Rising Sun, it is really necessary to register through the Datum Portal here, and permission is allowed to transmit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is only for the identification of strangers from other empires, not those who have lived in the Holy Alliance for quite some time, or have a clear attribution. Strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system was established to protect the safety of the Emperor and the other side of the portal. So no one has raised any objection, but the problem is the process. The designer is a nobleman in the House of Lords who specializes in writing the law. It is a versatile and complicated task. In any case, the nobles have more time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not practical, most of the time, the system is ineffective. As long as the origins are clear, it will be released. The only remaining procedure is to send a message to the opposite party. After receiving feedback, it will start transmitting this link, but the Dahan who guards the portal once More true, the power of this system will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three finally realized that they did not know where to offend the big man, but they believed that they were unlucky and honestly filled out the form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the portal is the floating island transmission hall where the royal family is located. When Richard and the girl walked out of the transmission array, several royal guards immediately took magic. The handcuffs are aimed at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Royal Guards seriously looked at Richard, his face immediately swept, replaced with a very respectful attitude, and said: "Respected Li Master, you are back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s time to come back and see." Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard has not appeared in Noland for a long time, remembering the appearance of some of the great characters of the Holy Alliance is the minimum requirement to stabilize this position. The captain of the Royal Guardian is obviously quite competent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the guards looked at the splash again, and the pupil immediately shrank slightly and asked, "Master Richard, this is."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My followers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, don't delay you, what do you need me to do for you?" The guard captain asked respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the water to the transfer to the public hall of FS Array, then you can return to the floating island of Archimonde from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that they disappeared in the transmission array, the captain of the Royal Guards realized that they were sweating, and those who had just returned from the battlefield were often unable to control. His own murderousness, but he has been here for a year, but he has not seen anyone with such a strong murderousness, almost let him breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, the girl suddenly asked: "Master, are we going to Faro first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
