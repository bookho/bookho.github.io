			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea have never forgotten the word gilding, but she said this for granted, and I missed it, facing my teacher. You used the honorific words, but did not notice that the legendary Master's face became more and more ugly. Of course, she noticed the change of Su Hailun's face, and she would definitely say what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun suddenly smiled, his eyes squinted like a crescent moon, charming and moving, the previous haze seemed to be swept away: "Gold-plated? Just because of me Is it a legendary mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea nodded and said, "Well, yeah! Plus you, I have three legendary teachers, the background is enough "[Search for the latest update<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is your other two teachers?" The legendary wizard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is the great elder of our tribe, and the other is the Wusheng Tibetan sword of the Millennium dynasty." The mountain and the sea answered with the same laugh. A little girl didn't know when she fled to her chest. She slipped her hand and slightly sideways. The posture of this wild girl suddenly became a little charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helenhaha laughed a few times and said, "Why do you say that the Garan emperor of the millennial dynasty has something to do with you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my grandmother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s smile immediately stagnated for a second before continuing to flow. She stared at the gray dwarf quietly, but Black Gold was innocent. The self-funded information was sent as early as the first time, but the legendary mage must have only a long string of eyes in the eyes, and the other content is ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun reached out and grabbed a splash of fruit bigger than her fist. The nails flicked slightly, and the shell cracked automatically. Sri Lanka smashed out a white fleshy jade-like flesh: "I heard that the blood of the high elves in the royal family of the Millennium dynasty, how could you suddenly have such a granddaughter? You obviously have just come out of the wild land." Oh, yes, I remembered it. More than a decade ago, the three emperors of the Garan emperor, the youngest goshawk of the four great dynasties of the Millennium dynasty, led the 50,000 army expedition to the wild continent. Is he..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, shortly after he boarded the mainland of Calando, he led the army and the warriors of our tribe to fight in the Falling Eagle Plain. The result was a temple led by the mother. The samurai defeated the Chinese army and was captured by the oysters. Most of the 50,000 warriors were arrested, and the mother was thrown back after a few days of frightening. And he became my father."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a click, a clear core was heard in Su Hailun’s mouth Crunchy. The legendary Master smiled on his face, his mouth moved a few times, and he swallowed everything in his mouth, as if the petal had no long core. When necessary, the legendary Master's mouth can also be compared to the bite force of the Earth Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, your mother is also a legend. There are four legendary backgrounds, it is not easy." Su Hailun said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea nodded and said, "Yes, plus you are five. The elders said that with this background, basically Noland can walk sideways. When you are in trouble, as long as you report the background, the other party will basically walk around and do not need to rely on the fist to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage laughed happily, and the laughter began to become very strange: "So, you just want to rely on the four legendary backers to suppress me? No wonder I don't put me in the eye. So, who are you behind, who are interested in playing with me?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun's eyes suddenly shot brilliantly, and almost all of the blonde hair fluttered and erected, and the light from the eyes almost stunned that others could not see her true colors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage sat still, his eyes swept over the four people behind the mountain and the sea. The two court guards snorted, as if they were hit by an invisible hammer, suddenly flew back ten meters, hit the wall heavily, and then slowly sat down. However, the steel rock stepped back a few big steps, and then slammed, and it stood firm. He poses in a sprint, staring fiercely at the legendary mage, but his nose and nostrils are bleeding. Only the old man was still standing, but his hair fluttered backwards, as if it had been blown by the wind, the two bones hanging between the necks slammed open, and a faint white smoke emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a helpless smile on the old man's face, slowly opening his eyes, his dry lips twitching, wanting to say something. However, his movements were as slow as ever, and the legendary Master spoke is crisp and fast. When the old man did not spit out a word, the legendary mage had already said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Let me try to come out of you. Although we have never met, the atmosphere of the ancient beast can’t fool me. Just You woke up my nap! Urazza Grand Sacrifice, you don't honestly stay in the holy temple of the Snowy Mountain Cangwu Pool, what are you doing to me? I can only understand that you want to find me to fight one? "Su Hailun's little hand slammed his hand and said to the big magician: "You all go out! Lest our noble guests say that I will win by many people. The old man, you have to say less in the legendary realm." It’s been fifty years, so don’t say that I’m bullying you after losing. And that big guy, let’s go together! The two wastes seem to be temporarily out of reach.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magisters looked at each other, of course, no one moved. Now I finally know why Su Hailun called them all with an emergency call when they met people. This is the show of strength. Of course, it is also a guarantee of the group. Of course, the scene at the moment is that the legendary Master has a certain victory, so a sufficient number of audiences are needed to cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng, the legendary mage has stood up and slammed two small hands, his eyes radiating excitement and said: "I haven’t played a good long time. It’s just that your barbarian is talking about using his fist. My sister is not very beautiful today, so let’s get started! Hey, you are not here, then I can start!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ulazazu forced the cane to set the steel rock that had been roaring and began to charge, and then shook his head helplessly, saying: "My dear Siruel Helen, I will be here, The first is to protect her, and the second is to express our sincerity to you. If you just want to find a legendary strongman to teach the mountain and the sea, then we don't have to pay the price of ten thousand gold coins."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s face is a little better. The big sacrifice is right. If you only want one name, then two million gold coins are enough to impress many legendary powerhouses. Not every legendary strongman will accumulate wealth like Su Hailun. The big sacrifice saw her shaken and thrown a chip in time: "Not every legendary strongman is qualified to be a teacher under the mountain and the sea. In fact, our candidate list on the mainland of Northland is quite Small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? How many people are there on the list?" The legendary Master was successfully evoked interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2." One gave Su Hailun some unexpected answers, but obviously made her happy. Another person who chose the Wusheng Tibetan sword of the Millennium dynasty is a name that can be juxtaposed with Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two choices two, the side shows that the Daxueshan Holy Temple and the Garland Emperor did not put the other legends of the mainland in their eyes. There may be other reasons behind it, but Su Helun is prepared to understand this anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
