			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battlefield, the fire-like 黛美 has begun to take shape, although she The level is still low, but the role played is not optional. The curse is a profession born for war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 is desperately weakening the strength of the enemy, while the elf poet Oral is strengthening the soldiers already. His magical singing voice is getting more and more intense, and the rhythm is gradually accelerating. The movements of the soldiers slashed with the sound of Oral's singing, and the power added a point, and the combat power was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha instigated the unicorn, going in and out of the battlefield. He did not deliberately attack, but focused on scheduling and command. The battlefield was in chaos, the warriors and the tree people fought together, and from time to time there were elves and Druids hiding in the woods. After the soldiers and the trees fight each other, they often have to bypass a natural tree before they can continue to fight. Many times, when they bypassed the big tree, they found that it was not the enemy just in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the battlefield of such chaos, Richard’s commanding ability was severely weakened. He wants to scream, even calling someone's name directly to get their orders executed. In some local small battlefields, many times the soldiers only care about killing, it is not clear how the battle around them. And Richard often has one or two orders to reverse the local battle. In some cases, Richard also needs to be hands-on to stabilize the battle. But Richard now only uses the four-level flame arrow to kill the tree, and dare not use the magic of range killing. After the real name awakens, Richard's anti-personal magic has brought a little abyss lava properties, the power has increased. Even ordinary fireballs that are weakened by the environment are not now able to confront ordinary warriors. The tree is thick and thick, and life is tenacious. When a fireball passes over, it may be that the tree is only seriously injured, but the surrounding soldiers are going to fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandru! Use the Death Ripple!" Richard saw that most of the soldiers had the effect of a soul guard, and immediately screamed, preventing the Necromancer from continuing to summon. The idea of ​​the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark gray ripple spurted out between the hands of the Necromancer, silently sweeping through the warriors, elves, and treemen who fought in front, until the number It disappeared ten meters away. Most of the soldiers of Richard frowned, only feeling a little dizzy and disgusting, but did not affect the continued fighting. The elf warriors were so painful that they were stabbed in the soul, and the seven or eight shooters fell down and twitched on the ground. This mistake has been fatal on the battlefield, and they are being stabbed by multiple weapons at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, an elf Druid fell from the tree and fell heavily on the ground. This is the unexpected harvest of the death ripple, and Sandru is overjoyed, and immediately recites the curse, ready to solve the opponent with a soul spear. When Richard saw this scene, he shook his head, and the fate of the twins waved forward. A six-level lightning fell from the sky and squatted on Druid. This lightning is entwined with dark red blood, although it is not a horrible electric fire that uses the blood of the victim after the sacrifice, but the power is much larger than ordinary lightning. The elder Druid had already turned into a night leopard to escape. After being hit by this lightning, after a scream, he turned into a fire, and ran wildly in the forest. The trombone is far away, and even the killing sounds on the battlefield cannot be concealed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dant’s long spell of soul spear was finished, the Druid had already fled to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning solution resolved the opponent, and Richard instigated the unicorn and rushed to another critical battlefield. Just then, with a cry, a large branch swept across! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard looked at the unicorn, he let the treeman's blow, and then ignored the tree, but looked at the far-end battle. In the chaotic battlefield, such attacks existed at all times, and Richard was not prepared to wrestle with a tree man. However, the unicorn suddenly had a temper, a side flush, and the one-horned scorpion on the head was nailed into the trunk of the tree! It suddenly became its own, and almost took Richard out of his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was furious, yelling at the consciousness and knocking on the head of the unicorn with the fate of the twins. The unicorn apparently did not put this blow in the eye. First, it slammed its head. The unicorn without a front was like a sharp blade everywhere. It opened a horrible deep hole in the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly pulled out the one-horn. The tree hole left by the unicorn flashed a little bit of light, and a lot of green juice was pouring from the depths, like a bloody wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the unicorn stabbed, the tree man’s movements were stuck there, screaming and screaming, his torso trembled, but he could not escape and counterattack I can only see that the unicorn has made such a huge wound on it. The tree man was cut by the warriors' swords and axe. It would have only oozing a little bit of sap, unless they hurt the heart of the tree in their depths, or cut the roots, otherwise the wounds will have almost zero impact on them. However, the unicorn is arbitrarily stabbed, stabbed in the thickest place of the tree man's wood, and the wound left is the wood pulp rush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree man screamed a few times and swayed a few times, and the huge tree fell slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made Richard very amazed. He pulled the unicorn's mane hard and said in his consciousness: "You can't see it, you are quite Can you fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn screamed proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare and easy episode in the past, Richard’s face was serious and his eyes swept through a chaotic battlefield. In the afterglow of his sight, a sharp arrow is flying over. Richard instantly calculated the end of its trajectory, which is the heart of a priest! Richard had no time to ask for help, but calculated the position of the shooter based on the trajectory of the arrow flying, and marked it in consciousness. An elite humanoid knight inserted the axe gun into the ground, pulled out the waist sabre, and threw it at the position marked by Richard! The sabre flew like a wind, and instantly fell into the depths of the canopy, and then a scream came from the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priest was standing stunned and wanted to look behind him, but couldn’t see the long arrow that was deeply immersed. There were two magical radiances on his body. It was the instant treatment of the other two priests, but the arrow was already in the heart, and what kind of magic was too late. The priest shook and fell slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the closely guarded priests have already died, indicating that there is no safe zone on the battlefield. Soldiers fell in front of Richard, and casualties occurred all the time. For the first time, Richard’s deep feelings of powerlessness, the war situation is heading towards a situation where he can’t control it. Just then, Neris wielded a giant axe and killed him from Richard. He danced like a wind, and cut a seriously injured tree man three or two times, then smiled at Richard and made a gesture of mastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little trick made Richard's heart settle down. He remembered that he had not used the book, but Nyris, Agamemnon, Water Splash, and Sands all had no last resort. Although the soldiers are constantly dying in the scuffle, the damage on the elves is several times more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the song of the fairy poet has arrived. Listening to the strong treble, the spirit of Richard is also alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a strong feeling passed over Richard’s heart. His eyes suddenly spurted a faint glow, and at the moment of the crisis, Richard finally launched the analytical power that had not been used. In the forest, a figure that is almost integrated with the surroundings is flying at an incredible speed. He has a strange spear in his hand. The spear is naturally generated by some kind of vine. The texture is natural and suitable for holding. The ends are inlaid with bone spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
