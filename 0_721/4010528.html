			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Great St. Louis, just finished a short prayer ceremony, but the ceremony The effect is not worse than the large prayers. The holy white light spot that appears to the naked eye appears on the statue. It is the symbol of the full joy of the Glorious Lord. At the end of the ceremony, more than a dozen priests and pastors stood up, and the headed one was actually a look. The handsome young man in his twenties, his blond hair, the sun, always with a pleasant smile, the young man holding a red and black two-color cover of the holy scripture, a huge holy book Wrapped in white gold, the worn edges are called for a long time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike other priests, the young man’s robes are decorated with red breasts and red ribbons around the waist and cuffs. He is a cardinal. In the Church of St. Hui, this is the position next to the Cardinal Archbishop. He sat in this position at his age and has been few in the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people who finished the prayers also floated with the looming light spots, which made several old priests could not help but reveal a little They are very clear that this prayer made the Lord of Glory very pleasant, but most of the divine grace given by the Lord fell on the young people, more than they got together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked back at the icon of the ten meters in the temple, with a hint of sorrowful smile on his mouth, and walked outside the temple with the holy scriptures. At this time, a 50-year-old bishop hurried into the room and saw the young man’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly greeted him and put it in the ears of young people. He whispered: "Martin, I just got a bad one. The news that Archimonde’s army suddenly appeared nearby, less than thirty kilometers away.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Martin did not care to say: "Ah, the army of Archimonde, they want to appear here is not an easy task, to cross the territory of several great aristocrats, who is the leader, this is a rare talent."<br /><br </ br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> People lead, there may be other goals, but this time is Richard, in my opinion, most of his goals ...here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin glanced at the bishop and smiled and said: "There is a lot of speculation, and the possibility of guessing is great." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop became more anxious and said, "Adult, if I guess, then your situation is in danger. Now that he has not arrived, you must leave with the Holy Scriptures."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people still have not stopped, and ask: "Why should I go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s forehead has seen sweat, hurried Say: "This temple is not important for your safety. The holy things stored here are not together, and the holy book in your hands is precious. The holy book must not fall into the hands of Richard. Your safety is equally important. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie sighed and said, "Does the defending city not be a city defense? Let them worry."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the city defense forces stop Richard, but Richard killed the murderer of His Royal Highness, our Knights of the Temple only two hundred people, the number may not have the structure of Richard There are many knights." This time, the bishop's voice was accompanied by a crying sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to building a knight, I heard that Richard has brought in more than five hundred." Martin is obviously interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop said with a smile: "Which there may be so many, the news I heard is between two hundred and three hundred, in addition to the North Road of Ellie There are more than one hundred knights in the army, but this number is not something we can resist, and I... I just got the gods yesterday, this time the St. Louis Temple may be in catastrophe."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s thoughtful expression, said: “It’s God’s revelation, oh, if you say this, you are not optimistic about the prospect of our resistance. You let me take the holy Code, what are you going to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is obviously prepared, and he does not want to say: "The priests will retreat with the adults, and I The Knights of the Temple will stay and guard the temple. Archimonde wants to embark on this kingdom of God, and every time you take a step, you have to pay the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Martin finally stopped and looked at the bishop with a surprised expression, saying, "You want to be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop smiled and nodded and said, "I only hope that after I die, the soul can ascend into the kingdom of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin glanced at the bishop and said, "A surprising idea, but worthy of respect. You don't have to persuade me. I won't leave. I also got the gods. It should be like your god. However, the way I interpret is different from yours. I don't think it is a disaster, but an opportunity, ah, yes, Bishop, I have been here for a few days, but I still forgot to ask your name."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Le Richelieu, Martin." The bishop answered reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Martin nodded and said, "Bishop, you make me surprised, I think, you should leave a mark in the history of the church. So, there is a bottle of red wine in my room, we can try it together, and talk about this Richard by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin adults, but yours Safety...and the Holy Scriptures...” The bishop is still making the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man smiled and said: "I am dead, there will be another Martin appearing, even if the Holy Scriptures are burned, it is still in the hearts of believers, What can be worried about, I think that this investigation is very interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, Richard has appeared outside the city of Tobol, this seat The city is famous for the Great St. Louis Temple, a territory of the Earl, located between the two great dukes. This arrangement is to avoid conflicts between the right to teach and secular rights. One count has not yet been able to challenge the privilege of the Great Temple of St. Louis. But a duke is not necessarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the city of Toble, and the information about the city and the temple appeared in his heart. At this moment, he realized the ingenuity of this design structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a kilometer, Richard can already see the expression of the defenders in the city. Although the soldiers are still standing, they have fear in their eyes. The face of the young warrior is as white as paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pointed to the city and said to the knights behind him: "Those city defense forces are not your enemy, the Knights of the Temple of the Holy Glory Yes, they have about two hundred or three hundred people. Don't underestimate them. In addition, the priests are also very dangerous. Try not to give them the chance to release the magic. Finally, if you see which sergeant is in hand Holding a thick book as a weapon, try to grab the book completely. Well, the only requirement is to capture the priests as much as possible. Don’t kill them unless you have no choice.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights in the building nodded and said that they remembered Richard’s order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, we are in the city." Richard waved and issued an order for the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of knights took the lead to dispatch, instigating the magic ride, slowly approaching the city wall, 800 meters, 600 meters, they have not accelerated, still At the speed of the walk, the knights are equipped with a team of fifty riders. The front is Gangde, Ogre, Senma, Zonghu and Twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective of Richard’s knight, the general responsible for the city defense on the wall changed his face and gritted his teeth: “Hell, how come there are so many knights, Are the sacred allied knights all coming, let our knights prepare, and the magic city is prepared to see that the big one is not, give me two arrows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the command of the general, there was magical fluctuations on the walls, and two giant pythons with two meters long screamed at Tiramisu, which was able to shoot a few meters into the rock. The deep power of the giant, the sanctuary strong does not dare to block, but since the growth of the second head of tiramisu, the natural power has far surpassed the human sanctuary, now he has The construction of the magical armed forces, the power is so incredible, the ogre lifted the heavy hammer, easily flying a giant python, and waved another giant python to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s eyes are coming out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a city defense squad dedicated to shooting war monsters, dragons or big magician, is a regular weapon of the sacred army, not low The inferior quality of the level plane, the two powerful giant pythons were actually photographed like this, and it was as easy as taking two flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, heavenly sanctuary." The general paled and slammed back and said: "All are ready, we fight with them, let the knights They gathered in the square behind the city gate, and our city gate could not stop the big guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s snoring just fell, a soldier ran away Come over, angrily said: "The knights refused to play, they said ... the number of enemy knights is too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general has a heavy punch Kneeling on the wall, angered: "This damn coward, we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
