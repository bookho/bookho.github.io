			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current half-plane of Richard is several times larger and the diameter has exceeded Five hundred meters. The energy-absorbing tree is indeed the top-level object that every plane needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in his half-face, there is a portal that is extremely grand and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portal did not exist, just in the moment, it suddenly appeared on Richard's half plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal is up to 30 meters, the overall style is gorgeous with mystery, and the door frame is based on the changing blue sè. It seems to be an entity, but it is only a concrete thing produced by the energy condensation, and does not use any physical material. But its structure is extremely stable, and it seems to be a permanent portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to use the portal to such a degree, the entire Noland is only Su Hailun. Even Richard, who has the title of space lord, is a whole bigger grade than Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why is the portal set up by Su Hailun so prominently appearing on Richard’s half-face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and touched the icy portal, then walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the portal, Richard came to a magnificent and bizarre world. This is a land block with a radius of a hundred kilometers. At the edge, a piece of energy-absorbing forest is swinging with a void storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is a mountain, it is a mountain made entirely of magic crystals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energetic pool water emerges from the top of the mountain, layer by layer along the mountain, filling one pool after another along the way. Then a small lake was formed at the foot of the mountain. The intensity of the energy in the lake can be taken directly as a magical agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, it is a mountain with a prismatic shape. The mountain peak floats directly in the air, with a honeycomb-like cave. The occupants of most caves are actually dragons of all races! This is actually a small dragon city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the size of the hive lattice, some giant dragons may not be able to force themselves into it, even turning over is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heartbeat gradually accelerated, and he looked up at the sky. Unsurprisingly, the sneak peek was deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a half-face, a half-face of a legendary mage. Seeing the energy-absorbing tree and the dragon city that imprisoned hundreds of dragons, how could Richard not know that this is the half-face of Su Hailun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about Su Hailun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard fall on the palace and portal of the half-face zhōng yāng. There are more than a dozen jīng coffins. But these jīng spirits fell to the ground at this moment, just like a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unstoppable chill emerged from the bottom of Richard’s heart. He gradually felt cold and his joints began to stiffen, while his legs lost strength. Standing very reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, he provoked great courage, squatting toward a jīng coffin falling to the ground, and then turned her over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This jīng coffin also has breathing, but also signs of life, just lost consciousness, as if in a deep sleep can not wake up. Richard knew what it was because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jīng coffins are all associated with Su Hailun’s soul, and they can act in full accordance with Su Hailun’s mind, which is very convenient to use. But now they are losing their souls. They can only explain one thing, that is, they have lost their soul connection with Su Helun and lost their ability to act! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embarrassment like this is itself an empty shell, and the soul of Su Helun is their soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard is on the spot, he knows that Su Hailun has an accident! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden appearance of the portal should have been set by Su Hailun. When she encounters an accident, it automatically appears on Richard's half-plane, while the closed half-plane leads to the dark blue portal. Then she would give her the half plane and all the wealth above it to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Xiang was soaked in the ice water and couldn't move anymore. He desperately wants to empty his consciousness, but the picture is tenaciously raised from the deepest part of memory, saying nothing to hide, and more and more clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the future fragment he saw in the Eternal and Time Dragon. The legendary Master floated in the endless void, sleeping quietly, his face was serene and calm. She is like this, drifting farther and farther in the void, and gradually sliding to the deepest part of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!!!" Richard suddenly looked up and made a long beggar like a beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to the screaming, then suddenly became a severe cough, and a mouthful of blood was coughed out. The fierce bursts suddenly came, and Richard could no longer stand, his knees soft and heavy on the ground. His head was low and his eyes were all scarlet blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard is already in chaos, and thousands of pictures are born and destroyed, one after another. Every painting is Su Helun. The ending of each picture is that she disappears into the end of the void of deep cold and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li's hands on the ground, I don't know how long it took, the fingers moved slightly, and then slowly and hard to make a fist. During this process, his joints continued to hum, like a machine with rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his body like a zombie, finally stood up, then squatted to the small lake at the foot of Jingshan, fell to the ground, big mouth Drinking the water in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the dragons in the Dragon City noticed Richard, they all quieted down, quietly watching Richard like the new one coming out of the desert. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dragons have a unique existence, which is small and exquisite, and even looks very cute. But its power is above all dragons, that is, the evil dragon Tiamat who was cast by Su Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Tiamat squinted and looked at the back of Richard, not knowing what he was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the dragon's hole, a black dragon's faucet was found, and the dragon whispered: "This kid is the one who inherited this half-plane? It looks very Weak look! As long as we kill him, not only will we get zì yóu, but all the wealth on this half of the plane belongs to us! How, Tiamat?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the proposal of Black Dragon, Tiamat did not answer immediately, but the dragon eye looked at Richard without hesitation, and there were sparkling lights in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Dragon is anxious and urges a few words. But he did not expect that Tiamat suddenly said, "I am very sleepy, need to sleep for a while. If you want to do something, do it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When finished, Tiamat simply ignored the black dragon and climbed into the depths of the Dragon Nest. In a twinkling of an eye, there was a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon hates to gnash his teeth, how can you sleep so fast? But the power of Tiamat is still above it. It doesn't dare to say anything more. It just turns its head and stares at the back of Richard, and the fierce light in his eyes flashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there are not a few dragons who are exposed to fierce light. However, Su Hailun is also very strong in their bondage. At this moment, most of the dragons are unable to leave the Dragon City, and only a few dozen dragons have zì yóu with limited action. If you want to attack Richard, you can only rely on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons hesitated, some of them have begun to fight, but Su Hailun’s accumulation is too heavy, these dragons always think of involuntarily What should Su Hailin suddenly come back? At that time, the skin cramps were light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already full of water at this time, and he violently gasped at the lake. He was injured very seriously, drinking this untreated lake, although it can fill the magic in an instant, but it is equivalent to the second injury to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly propped up his body slowly, and then the surface of the body ignited a light blue sè flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many dragons in the Dragon City that are either Red Dragon or Yanlong, but the blue fire on Richard’s body makes them feel scared, even if it’s It will be burned when you look at it more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally stood up and stood silently at the lake, and the blue flame was still rising. An indescribable devastating scent gradually emanate from him, covering the entire half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons suddenly felt the extreme fear, the fear of death, the fear of being unknown to the unknown. Some of the weakest dragons simply squat down and can't climb completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dragons looked at the slightly thin figure on the lakeside, and they felt that they could swallow him in one bite, but they could not move. The fear from the depths of the soul makes it difficult to stand even. That is the fear that will arise when faced with absolute superior life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire Dragon City, only Tia Matt shrinks and sleeps deep in the nest. However, if you look closely, you can see that the tail of the evil dragon is also shaking slightly, and the four small claws hold the ground tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood quietly and looked at himself in the lake. The lake reflects a young and beautiful face. The burning blue light disturbs the air, but the face is a bit fuzzy, but because of this, it has a bit of mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue fire of Licha suddenly converges, and all are inhaled, no traces. The land under his feet suddenly spreads over the grass, and the flowers are a little bit dense and dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden emergence of a strong life, so that all the dragons are stunned. It has just been destroyed, and now it is a vitality, a sudden and strong change, completely beyond their ability to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned and looked over the dragon from the top of the dragon, and said coldly: "I am in a bad mood now, it is best not to come to death." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a relentless threat, the dragons feel shy and anger. The dragons are noble lives with extra dignity. Although the sense of dignity of the dragons captured by Su Hailun will be slightly weaker, there are still some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even under the pressure of the legendary Master, there are still many dragons waiting for the opportunity to resist and escape. And it seems to be a good opportunity at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked to Longcheng. When he stepped into the Dragon City, the sky suddenly flashed a faint glow, a small treasure blue sè reel from the void It fell out of the way, just in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I saw this scroll, the breathing of all the dragons suddenly became much heavier. They felt the breath of their soul from this scroll! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the soul contract that can control all the dragons in Dragon City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
