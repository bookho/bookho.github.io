			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Minnie’s somewhat annoyed look, Stevenson added "After I became a High School student, there are still many things that I need to ask you. At least, I don't know much about Deep Blue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunton, he added: "In addition, I feel that the relationship between us can go a step further and be more closely linked in another situation, for example, a marriage contract."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini was shocked and looked up at Stevenson. She wanted to say something but she was forced to go back. Her chest was undulating, and it took a few deep breaths to calm down. Minnie put her legs off the sofa, sat down in the body, and said in a tone of seriousness: "We are only meeting for the first time, but we can’t understand it at all, and we can’t even like it. You don’t feel it right now. Is it too early to say this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson smiled and said, “Beautiful Miss Minnie, as a direct bloodline of a prominent family. You should know that our marriage does not need to like it. As long as we don't dislike each other, it is a good result. It is the family and interests that connect us, not to mention the common hobbies between us.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I understand it, at least I know enough about you. Because Randolph has succeeded in getting married to you, he has collected all the information about you that can be found. Of course, After this incident, someone has sent the same information to me. As for me, you must have heard about it, and there will be enough time in the future to learn more.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most The point, and perhaps the most important point, is that the Marquis of Nio and the Soram family need to form an alliance, and this alliance must be maintained by a marriage. There is no better marriage in the Neo family. So, if you don't choose me, are you willing to marry my brothers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't marry anyone!" Cold answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson smiled calmly and said: "This is not honest. If you do this, you can only leave the Neo family. Without the support of Marquis of Nio, I don't think you can pay for your tuition, although the tuition you need to pay is only one-fifth of my. In addition, I have heard that His Highness does not like the money that some people owe her." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Minnie’s meditation, Stevenson shrugged and said, “And, you see, this person is not annoying. As for you. Miss Minnie, if I need a wife, it is difficult to find a better object than you. I suggest you consider my proposal, but do not need to rush to make a decision. The greatest advantage of our magician is rationality and calmness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Hailun’s voice suddenly came out of the living room: "It is indeed the magician’s advantage. But the magician is not a warlock. The warlock's bones are all very crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen The drawing room, directly to their bodies thrown into the theme of the sofa, then pulled the red silk sash hanging next. With a pleasing ringtone, the side door on the other side of the living room opens, six black slaves sneak in, carrying a special red coffee table, incense burner, and of course, the gorgeous gold pot, which is full of legendary masters. Snacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Hailun put himself comfortably, he said, "Go and call the black gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An apprentice flew away immediately, and after a moment the Grey Dwarf Magister rushed in. Black gold, the full name is black gold. Sa clothing Yek. Storm hammer. The Hammer of the Storm is a large tribe of the Grey Dwarf, large enough to have established its own kingdom. Black gold is a very special gray dwarf, does not like spirits, but has the same profound insight into ore and jewelry. And because of the unique magical talent, the enthusiasm for collecting gold coins, and the unique ability in identification, it finally occupied the position of the legendary mage financial officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking a look at a piece of paper handed over by the gray dwarf, Su Hailun has been tightening until the small face is now stretched out. There was also Stevenson standing there in the living room, so he nodded to him and said, "Are you the Stevenson? It's not bad, don't stand, sit down!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson chose the edge of the sofa, sat down satisfactorily, his face was rare and serious, and even pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun carefully read the information in his hand, while some casually said: "Dragon Vessels, yes, very rare. What is the dragon's blood?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Dragon." Stevenson replied with respect, and then his face was paler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s gaze swept a small line of words, and this line was underlined by black gold with a pen to indicate importance. After reading it, the legendary mage originally stretched a little but still a gloomy little face suddenly a few more sunshine, played a rare patience to explain a few words: "There are many dragons that I have bullied, not killing Less, for a long time, there will be more deterrent to the dragon. And you have the blood of the dragon, and it will be uncomfortable to stay with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are really admirable!" said Stevenson. This is really his words. Su Hailun’s effect on the reverse of Longwei is not a natural formation, but the accumulation of the curse before the death of the dragon. Of course, the curse can't really hurt Su Helun, but the reverse Longwei is not used to help the legendary mage fight, but to remind the dragon to be vigilant. A hundred kilometers away, the dragons will perceive the arrival of Su Hailun. Just how many dragons are going to fall, can you form a reverse dragon in this woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few paragraphs of the page were outlined by Black Gold, with additional emphasis and even a few lines of detailed comments. This is a list of supplies, the tuition paid by the Duke of Soram for Stevenson. When the eyes moved to the last few lines, the legendary Master's face was like a spring blossom, full of sunshine, she wanted to laugh, but she was forbearing in front of the new students. In any case, the legendary Master's posture is still very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Stevenson is! Come, come sit, these fruits are not bad, you can try!" The legendary mage feels good. Share your snacks. After all, from the list, the Duke of Soram paid the full amount of sponsorship, not half of the agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson was a little closer to Su Hailun, but did not know how to move her snacks, although there were a few things that really made him Very desperate to take a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the list several times, Su Hailun was reluctant to hand over the paper to the black gold. It wasn't until then that she finally looked up and looked at Stevenson seriously, asking: "How is Solam's recent mix, isn't the legendary legend? But he should already be legendary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s body immediately straightened up, he has long waited for this question: “Father has successfully advanced to the legendary field at the end of last year, becoming a demon war ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
