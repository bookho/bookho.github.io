			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to fifteen." Young great magician has an unusual Confident and calm, he took the hand of Salenwell coldly and resolutely, and said bluntly: "Magic will not lie, and one day, you will believe this sentence. The 12th grade Mr. Magician!" He emphasized the keyword of the 12th level, which makes it very ugly for Saranwell's face to be ugly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as a fifteenth-level magician of the age and the same as that of Saronville, its status is not lower than that of his emperor, but on the contrary. And this great magician belongs to the Sequoia Kingdom, and it is not necessary to buy the account of the Iron Triangle Empire. If not the reputation of the artist of the Warrenville War, the young great magician had long turned his face to this offensive statement. Although the people in the command area are well-informed, there are still many people who have already seen that the situation is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the opponent’s death fighters have already surpassed 2,000, but the damage has already exceeded 1,000, which makes the number comparison from one to two become close to one four. The front line may collapse at any time, and behind the opponent's front, the town bear knights once again assembled, this time not in the ten-ride, but all the knights began to assemble. Obviously, Hinckler will end his opponent with a decisive assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat!" Salenville issued the last order, only to feel full of bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This failure will be a major stain in his life that is difficult to wash away, losing the entire group of elite imperial knights and 500 mobile infantry, for the Iron Triangle The Empire is also a very heavy loss. The reorganization of the reorganized Knights of the Temple and the battle of the gods will give the empire a heavy blow to the natural ally of the Sequoia kingdom and the temple of courage. A large priest, a sacred knight, and a large number of magicians died in battle, and this loss is still on the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what makes him unacceptable is that the great magician next to him will definitely pin the enemy’s power on the 'fifteenth grade'. Because 'the power of magic will not lie', and endorsed by his genius magician, the future big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the carriage began to turn around, Saranwell finally looked at the battlefield, and suddenly there was an urge to swear. Look, the woman has killed a whole dozen heavy infantry, almost a killing machine that will never stop! Before that, she also killed a big priest and a sacred knight. If this is only the squadron's combat power, Saranwell dared to dig his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarrenville would like to ask if the genius's head is filled with the magic of distiller's grains, no one he knows. The guys under the 18th level can achieve such a record on the frontal battlefield. Sarenwell dared to swear in the name of the royal ancestor, no matter what the level of the devil girl, her strength is absolutely eighteen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Saranwell ordered, many aristocratic lords had already seen the situation not good, and first evacuated the battlefield. The aristocratic squadrons formed dozens of trickles and went in a chaotic direction away from the battlefield. As for the soldiers who are still fighting in a desperate battle, they are left behind mercilessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common occurrence in the nobility war. If the warrior is dead, he can still recruit. If it is not possible, he can hire a mercenary. Once the lord is captured, he may be killed. The best ending is to pay a large ransom, it is better to hire a warrior with this money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Sinclair suddenly made a loud scream, and the huge lion was carrying her up. Its huge body is tens of meters away from each other, and it is forced to cross the battlefield with incredible high speed and pursue it with Salenville! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of strong players in the retreating team, so there is only a little confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen, who still stood at the top of the carriage, and the fifteenth-level magician cast six levels of magic dissociation at the same time, two dark green magic The light ball instantly locked the Sinclair and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl jumped up and once again rushed into the guards blocked by the front line of the carriage with the ability to flash and let go. This time her figure is no longer looming, if a black tornado, high-speed rotation wedged into the queue, there are four or five elite guards killed in the moment of flying double knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the two dissociation lightballs turned a corner in the air and still rushed to her. She reached out and grabbed the two guards and threw them back to the disintegration. One of the guards immediately dyed the green all over the body, and the blink of an eye collapsed into a dusty sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is obviously strong and the response is much faster. When the temper is flashing, it is extinguished by dissociation, but the deadly green is also a lot weaker. Through the magical power of understanding, but also suffered heavy damage, spurting a blood in the air, has lost his mind. The magical power of the two dissociation techniques also spread to Sinclair, which caused a strange green on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sinclair continued to impact the carriage, the big priest on the roof had driven a delicate and gorgeous scroll of magic, as he angered, one Huge god symbols appeared in the air, and then the power of the gods converge into a huge destructive force, guided by the power of the great priests, all shocked on the body of Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the seventh-order mantra: disciplinary, originally a divine power of scope, but was led by the great priest to bombard all the people in Sinclair, actually let her Another spurt of black blood, he fell back and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion whispers, the teeth bite the claws, shred a few warriors who want to come up and cheap, and firmly protect the Sinclair. The girl snorted and grabbed the lion's mane and climbed to its back, staring at the big priest at the top of the carriage, and did not continue to pursue. Under the gaze of her gaze, the face of the great priest looked extremely ugly, and the hand holding the scepter trembled slightly, but stood strong and stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell looked around for a week and watched the nearly a thousand elite private soldiers who were escaping from their own masters, and could not help but want to swear again. If these fighters are handed over to him, if the two of the carriage roofs can shoot earlier, instead of standing there and pointing to the mountains and saying, 'The power of magic will not lie', then the battle of this battle may not be early. It was reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, what has happened is not there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnants of the coalition are still fighting in a desperate battle. Although they have been abandoned, their beliefs and honours still support their bloody battles. They all know that this girl is the spokesperson of the devil, often killing prisoners as they please, even if they become servants of the devil can not avoid the tragic fate. Moreover, they are not blood-stained places without past or future refugees. They are national soldiers, with families, families, homes, fallen and glory, and they chose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroic warriors of the coalition soldiers entangled the enemy and also won time for the retreat of the noble lords. But it is doomed that no one will remember them except their family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair stood quietly on the top of the lion's head. She was as weak as a broken doll at the moment, and now seems to have slowed down, her breath. It is constantly being enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
