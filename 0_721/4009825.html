			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several patrols rushed to the gate with a torch, just to see one The armed bandits flocked to the manor. Under the torchlight, the front patrol saw the gangster's face. He suddenly identified a few familiar faces from inside and cried out in surprise: "Pier! Are you? Ah, isn’t that uncle Joan, how can you be? You are not following the high-level adults to seek the alien face demon. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierre and Joman, who were called to break their identity, stopped involuntarily, and the other three prisoners also stopped. The two sides confronted each other and the patrol Obviously, we have not figured out the situation. Behind several captives, Gangde showed a cruel smile and clenched the giant axe in his hand. A few stepping knights moved to the two wings, and the girl in white was quietly standing in the shadow behind Gangde, and the breath converges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this subtle moment, Richard, standing in the tower and looking down at the overall situation, issued a cold command: "Jomman! Kill them!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is in the ear, the middle-aged warrior named Joan Mang hears the devil's whisper, and the subconscious wave is a knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man opposite the stunned, then bowed his head and looked at the wound that suddenly appeared on his chest, and his face was unbelievable. The wound was deep and long, almost revealing the internal organs. It was obvious that Joan had used all his strength. And the knife went straight to the point, and it was so fast that the young man couldn't wait for the reaction. The broken bone broke the body, but it didn't shake his body, it was superb and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knives of Joman show the merits of the veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knife fell, and Joan himself stunned, but immediately reacted, and stepped forward, smashing into the belly of the young patrol! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! Kill them!" This time it was not Richard, but Joman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will cut down a patrol with every bang. Other prisoners, like their dreams, woke up, and they rushed to the ground to kill more, and the knife and the light flashed. In the blink of an eye, all seven or eight patrol soldiers were cut down to the ground. This group of captured warriors, regardless of their age, are veterans who have seen people who have seen blood. This killing, where is the militia opposite? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already a beginning, and the captives simply let go of their hands and feet, lifted the shield and held the knife, and greeted a patrolman who came to support. Between the blood and the shooting, the squad patrol was all cut down, and even a live mouth did not stay. Occasionally, if you are seriously injured, you will immediately add a few knives to the passive knife or the person next to you. Once there was no retreat, the sizzling of these veterans made Gangde shrug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has prepared a fireball technique, but now it is no longer needed. He blessed himself with a feather drop and jumped out of the tower. It was like a flying feather. At this time, the main building and the side building not far away have sounded noisy vocals. The militias of the squadrons flocked out. Although they were messy and even had no weapons, the advantage in number was too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five captives stood tightly together, panting sharply, each of them had some injuries, but it provoked the fierce Sex, eyes staring red at the opposite side of the old man, holding the steel knife in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sand drifted out of the darkness, and the treatment of minor injuries has fallen on two deeper prisoners. These soldiers are very accidental, but they are morale! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard has fallen from the sky, expanded his voice with magical power, and shouted: "Dare to resist, all killed on the spot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice shrouded the entire manor, and the patrolling rushers were shocked and couldn't help but slow down. However, after being pushed by the people behind, they rushed up again. This time their shouting is particularly fierce, as if to make themselves courageous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is coming out of the crowd, raising his right hand high, then waving forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream in the night sky, a sharp arrow coming out of the air, and a patrolman rushing to the forefront was nailed to the ground! When Richard's right hand was pressed, four violent wild boars appeared in front of them. These huge and powerful figures appeared in an instant, and the blessing of sand drifting did not fall on them. The four beating savage beasts rushed the patrol's team in a moment, and a bad guy was pierced by the wild boar's fangs, rising high in the air, and screaming through the night sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is so excited that he is full of blushing light, and the more out of the crowd, just roaring, "My big axe is already...", the ear is coming. One, then the fierce energy hit, a burning fireball has crossed him and exploded in the middle of the patrol! The fire is overflowing, and the edge of power is only a few meters away from Gangde! Just now, if Gangde moves a little faster and really jumps into the patrol center, it will also bear the baptism of the fire wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is very aware of the horror of his own head. The ordinary fireball is in the hands of Richard. It is a metamorphosis, when the first fireball explodes. The second fireball must have been shot. Can not help but speed back, faster than the momentum of the forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the fire wave caused by the previous fireball technique is still spreading, and another fireball flies past Gangde and blasts among the remaining patrols. . The range of the two fireballs has shrouded the fierce wild boar that is rushing to the left and right in the crowd. When the first fireball burst, the violent wild boar was out of control and began to turn around and hatefully stared at the summoner Richard. However, the second wave of fire immediately rolled over, sending all four violent wild boars and more than 20 patrols around to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manor is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a dozen seconds before and after the three magics, the first batch of patrols rushed to the scene. Looking at the empty and empty square, not only the patrols were shocked, but even many people on the Richard side were secretly scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes jumped a few times. If I didn’t listen to Richard’s order, I’m really jumping into the crowd according to my own thoughts. I’m afraid the big axe still Did not open, he was first bombarded by Richard's two fireballs. Any level 10 warrior will not be willing to fight the two fireballs of the magician, not to mention the interval between the two fireballs is more than one second, which makes it impossible for the tenth-level comrades to reunite. The high-profile jazz was dressed in a heavy armor and was a 12-level vindictive, and was also put down by Richard's five fireballs. In the beginning, if it wasn’t for the ‘care’’ of the high-ranking man, but to point all the power centers of the fireball to the height of the covenant, then the four fireballs would be enough to bring down the jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch of patrols that had just gathered up suddenly burst into excitement. They turned around and fled into the main building! They seem to have forgotten that if Richard had two more fireballs to ignite the main building, then the fire would be enough to send all of them to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nearly a hundred militiamen in the manor, but their will to fight has been completely blasted by Richard's three magics. Richard once again raised his right hand and pointed his finger at the main building. He said: "Leave a woman and a child and kill any man who dares to resist!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
