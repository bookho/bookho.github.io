However, at this meeting, although he was in the main position, he felt extremely isolated. Because the aristocrats are sitting around the table, even if they are sent representatives, they also have at least one jazz identity. Many small branch families are simply homeowners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme of the conference is incredible, that is, whether it is possible to 'borrow' some of the sacrifices to the people so that the branch family can also enjoy the sacrifice of the sacrifice, so that grow rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to "borrow" sacrifices, but what? The old butler sat straight and looked at each other from the face of Archimonde. In addition to Sauron, Goliath, and Ellie, which branch family can still afford even the lowest level sacrifice? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if it wasn’t for Gordon’s initial entry into the fascinating world, the name of Archimonde would be carried into the city of miracles. Most people don't even have the qualification to enter FS. It is that Sauron and Goliath want to sacrifice, and they have to do it through the floating islands, and they have to pay a lot of money for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motions and strong adherences are all from the side of the tribe, while the representatives of Sauron, Goliath and Elliott are also at the venue, but Silence, that is, disapproval and no objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the side families are rare and savvy once, and no one is asking about the opinions of the three most powerful Archimonde. At this sensitive moment, the weak Archimonde is going to be a cannon fodder, rushing to the front, so that it is possible to share a piece of cake. Although the final big man will definitely be taken away by three Archimondes, it is absolutely foolish to try to drag them into the water at the trial stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid people are not living long, at least not long enough to let them climb high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just borrow a little sacrifice, and after the grace of God, the power is strong, and will naturally come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! It is evidenced by the blood of Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Gordon and Richard don’t come back, are these offerings? Is the product so moldy? It only makes sense to become power immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the venue is getting higher and higher, and the emotions are getting more and more exciting. There are a few thoughtful people who actually began to direct the topic to the sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the situation will be out of control, the old butler finally coughed a few times and said: "What I need to remind you is that these sacrifices come from dark blue, yes His Royal Highness Su Hailun was assigned to Master Richard. Strictly speaking, they do not belong to Archimonde, and if we arbitrarily use it, it is likely to anger the great Highness of Su Hailun."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was silent for a moment, many people look at me, I will look at you again, I don’t know what to say for a while. Su Hailun’s prestige is by no means a talk. The idiots who are hot-headed and arrogant also know that they can’t provoke a legendary mage, especially if there is no big name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, a middle-aged man turned his eyes and suddenly said: "Do you have any evidence that the sacrifices were assigned to Master Richard? Even if they are from dark blue, perhaps he is given to the entire Archimonde family by His Highness Su Hailun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right! And Master Li has confirmed that he was lost in the turmoil of time. Certainly... Oh, I don’t know when I can get back. So these sacrifices are still in the original, and should now belong to Akmen. De Quanzuo! We are all Archimonde people, and naturally we should also divide some sacrifices!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sound is getting louder and louder, everyone's The tone is getting more and more taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper sighed and said: "I think it will be better to wait for the return of the adult after Gordon's return."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" A young and unassuming young man dismissed his face and said loudly: "You are just a servant. What qualifications are there to speak at this venue? Here is Ake. Where is the Monde family's deliberation, do you have Archimonde's blood on your body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! What resolutions have we reached, you are doing it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting more and more turbulent, and people who are clamoring are getting more and more excited. Anyway, it has already torn the face, and one after another, simply let go of the scruples and begin to force the palace unscrupulously. Compared with Gotton who is offended and undecided, the chance of a sacrifice is obviously much more precious. For these small branches, it is simply Nirvana Nirvana! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have never sacrificed, even the qualifications for onlookers are not, but countless legends about the grace of God, like the heavenly snake fruit seduce People's fragrance, it seems that as long as you take a bite, you can reborn and suddenly enter the legendary field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler slammed the table and silenced the audience! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is not a strong person, many people can be seriously injured when they are present. He also has no glorious deeds. For most of his 60-year career, he has quietly done all sorts of trivial things for Archimonde. Being able to sit here is more because of the trust and rights that Gotton left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the moment, people have seen a trace of Gordon from the old housekeeper! Majestic, bursting, such as erupting volcanoes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the people who were still uncertain were all lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler’s gaze passed over a few of the most powerful people, and he snorted and said coldly: “You, also with self-proclaimed Archimonde ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" These people were swept away by the old housekeeper, initially subconsciously shrinking, then reacted, jumped up in anger and roared Road: "Are you a man, dare to insult the noble Archimonde?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper ignored the roar of these people, but was low A firm voice said: "I don't care which channel you got the news from which channels. But here, I finally tell you that these sacrifices belong to Master Li. Anyone who wants to take it, only rely on it. Long sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no different from the war declaration. Gordon left a lot of guards on the floating island, and there were a large number of stepping knights or quasi-constructed knights trained. However, most of the latter come from various branch families. In the current situation, loyalty has doubts. The old butler can rely on, perhaps only the guards that Gordon brought out with one hand. But in any case, it can't change the passive situation of lacking high-end force on the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, even one or two of the thirteen knights do not make sense to sit on the floating island, so Gordon will take all the knights to the expedition. There are not many valuable things on the floating island. Who dares to attack the floating islands, and when the Gotton army returns, it will be destroyed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence in the conference hall, and greed did not completely overwhelm the senses. The shadow cast by Gordon to the people was not eliminated in just half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many eyes turned to Baron Souya, as well as representatives of Goliath and Elliott. The current situation, only the real powers in these three Archimonde can be cracked. These branches of the family are bold, and there is no backing behind them, and they dare not attack Gotton’s guards. In that case, once the failure is the disaster of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Suya lowered her head and only concentrated on the scabbard of the dagger in her hand, as if nothing happened around him. Only if you look closely, you can see a scorn in his eyes. The representatives of Goliath and Ellie also did not say a word, and they seemed to have nothing to do with the whole incident, but they did not hide their arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their eyes, these so-called Archimonde in the conference hall are just a group of monkeys jumping up and down, the real Archimonde is some The arrogant, rude and arrogant madman is now fighting in the Quartet. They are willing to use blood and sword to open up the space for survival, not by tongue and conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if Gordon is really unable to return, or the situation is beyond control, they do not mind temporarily "borrowing" strategic resources. As for the monkeys in front of them, at that time, they were able to start the cannon fodder. But in front of us, it is obviously far from being desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three parties did not express their views. As a result, those who roared did not know how to end, so the meeting ended. When leaving the conference hall, the backbone of the old butler seems to be taller than anyone else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the beginning, and the monkeys are still on the floating island. Because Gotton had orders, many facilities on the floating island were open to each branch family. Therefore, the old housekeeper is also unable to drive away them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing, and the struggle continues in countless trivial things. The monkeys tried to show their superiority on all occasions and retaliated against the old steward's assertion about them. But the words of the old butler at the meeting quickly spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, also known as Archimonde?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silent, don't know From what day, there were more Archimonde on the floating island. They have the breath of blood and fire, and there are countless scars on their bodies, and even the eyes are full of fierce and wild words that cannot be said. From clothing and weapons, it can be seen that they come from various places, there are underground worlds, lava fields, and polar ice sheets. But no matter where they come from, regardless of the level, they all have a common characteristic, that is, an extremely dangerous atmosphere. They are not many in number, but when they are gathered together, they can fight against thousands of horses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they came to the floating island, they lived in the most rudimentary place. It doesn't matter what they eat, they can eat enough. Usually only appear in the training ground or in the position of patrol guards. Rest, guard and training are all their lives. They seem to be doing nothing and aimless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the old butler, no one can command them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is some real beast, also from the various branches of Archimonde, and also claims to be Archimonde. They came from all directions, no one called, no one ordered. Looking at them alone, they are just one or two drops of water, but when they come together, they become a turbulent undercurrent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
