			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest seems to never reach the end, but everyone just sees the front Richard, inexplicably confident, continued to climb up, unconsciously, in this monotonous and horrible journey, Richard has become their spiritual pillar, although in terms of magic level, Richard may It is the weakest of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten hours and eleven minutes later, Richard finally got out of the clouds and climbed up a dozen meters. Richard stood on a high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers drilled one by one from the clouds, followed by Richard on the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suddenness of the line of sight has made them somewhat uncomfortable, saying that it is a high platform, and its practical plains are more appropriate to describe, because this high platform has hundreds of squares. Kilometers, on this high platform, the vision is far-reaching, far away from the unbearable level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the crowd, it’s a dark black sky, you can’t see the end, they are like standing in the middle of a vast expanse of void, the platform at the foot is in the void The only place to fall, although this platform is very large, but in this endless void, it is as small as a grain of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange space, time is still flowing, but space follows a completely different set of rules, completely subverting Richard’s common sense, he stands At the edge of the platform, I didn't know what to do at the moment. No one thought that the top of the nest was such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard saw a flashing reticle in the center of the platform, which may be the secret of the nest, the mask does not look far, but In the past, there are dozens of kilometers away. The easiest way is to fly over. However, Richard thought of the ancient warnings left by the Shulan people. He moved in his heart and leaned over to pick up a stone and throw it to the sky. The stone has been exhausted for several meters, but it has not fallen back to the ground, but it has completely lost its gravity and flew to the void. It is in front of everyone, it is flying farther and farther and disappears gradually. Deep in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how far the void is, and where it is at the end. Once you leave the platform, you may be lost in the void forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vomited heavily and said, "Don't leave the ground, keep distance from each other, we walked over."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a group of people who can also be called strong in the main plane, honestly went to the platform center. Two hours later, they finally reached the center of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center is clearly different from the rest of the platform. The land here is made up of silver sand, and a huge mask covers the silver floor. Looking through the mask, there was nothing inside, only a piece of silver sand, and Richard reached out and tried to touch the light curtain. Without any obstacles, his hand easily passed through the light curtain. In the process of passing through the light curtain, Richard did not feel any abnormality in the space, so he walked into the light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of followers, as soon as Richard entered the light curtain, his figure suddenly disappeared, and there was nothing behind the light curtain. All the followers immediately became shocked. Tiramisu yelled a "head" and followed Richard to rush into the light curtain. The ogre just plunged into the light curtain, and the world immediately changed. Richard suddenly appeared in front of him, and the ogres saw it. Unable to stop, Li will be hit, and Richard suddenly moved a few meters, letting the ogres hit a collision. At this time, the followers appeared one after another, although they did not hit each other, but they were quite Wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside and outside of the light curtain are completely two worlds, so no one has thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that he and his followers had entered the light curtain, and at the foot was the fine silver sand, but the world inside the light curtain became vast. They stood on a stretched cliff at the moment and looked forward. It was also an endless deep space. Richard tried to walk to the cliff and looked out, suddenly shaking his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless void outside the cliff, there is a huge blue planet floating in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so huge that it makes Richard’s illusion, as long as he jumps on it, it’s possible to jump on that planet, on the surface of the blue star. There are still exquisite artificial lines, and it is not clear what it is, and the void is no longer empty, but floating around with large and small wrecks. I don’t know what is left, there is a huge metal in the wreckage. The creation, and the incredible giant skeleton, looks like a fierce battlefield left after a big war. It is only from that skeleton that the war has no idea what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone is a strong person, and there are people like Richard, Achilles, and Liusha who are enough to be called wise men. They can’t imagine what it is. A strong race can leave such a magnificent battlefield relic. Compared with this war, the plane war they experienced in the past is like a child's game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, there was another huge honeycomb-like metal object that slowly passed through the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing can’t be said to be anything, but at least it should be hundreds of kilometers long, it has a smooth surface, and at the end is something that is violently stripped. There is a honeycomb-like compartment inside, and occasionally a silver object slides out from it, floating in the void, following the huge beehive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So great, so desolate, so lonely, so old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard felt like he was stuffed with something in his chest, so heavy that he couldn’t breathe. He looked around and saw the followers all around. I feel better, like finding a fulcrum in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the huge blue star in the distant sky and said, "That should be the nest."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand breathing is becoming a rush. Her eyes are constantly appearing in the eyes and quietly annihilating. After a moment she suddenly sweats and looks very tired. She said: "The time here. The flow rate is all right, but the space is completely outside the range I can understand, and I can't control the power of time here, or even feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sand is used to manage the sweaty hair, pointing to the numerous floating debris in the void, saying: "There will be many sacrifices there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naiyou is also looking around, and her eyes are constantly switching between black and white. But when she looks at her expression, she obviously has nothing to gain. The fighting god official frowns thinking about something. Suddenly she raises her eyebrows and says, "I will try." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he raised his right hand and immediately showed a burning moment on his fingertips Golden ball of fire, which is burning pure divine power, with the most simple and basic properties, along with the swirling fireball god, god of light and worked as a golden ribbon to shoot in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the gods hit the distance, and finally there was a reaction. Many of the divine light bands were spurred on a transparent light curtain, and the outline of the light curtain was outlined. When it came out, the light curtain was hanging a few centimeters outside the cliff, and the empty battlefield was isolated from the crowd. Richard touched the light curtain and was bounced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to enter the ancient battlefield, it seems that we must first break this light curtain, with the experience of trying to open the isolation door in the temple, now no one dares to look down on anything in the nest, Senma pulled out the sword, said "First try it for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have stepped back and left room for the blood lord, and Senma Pei immediately dyed it. A layer of faint red light, a glimpse of the sky, a red sword shadow flew out of the sword, squatting on the light curtain, the original transparent light curtain instantly lit up, the sword shadow on the light curtain, miraculously The light curtain is integrated into one, and a large light curtain is instantly dyed in a reddish color, and then slowly fades away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma did not say a word, strode forward, the whole person banged a bloody grudge, and a sword directly stabbed on the light curtain, but When the sword tip of the sword touched the light curtain, it suddenly condensed at that point, and it was no longer allowed to enter. Then, with the tip of the sword as the center, a large piece of blood on the light curtain began to spread rapidly, and spread to tens of meters in a blink of an eye. Senma only stagnated for a moment, and the sword in her hand suddenly slammed into pieces, and she spurted a blood and slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are all a bit dumb, and Senma is saying that they are all Sanctuary strong. Under the full blow, the light curtain is not shaking. It wouldn't be of any use to change other people, but they still didn't give up, so Axiris, Io, Nye, Shuihua and Ogre were all tried, and Richard also blew a few lightnings. Magic, magic, and war skills have all been tried. There is no effect at all. Every attack is to let the light curtain dye a large corresponding color. The greater the attack power, the larger the dyeing area, but how do people keep on doing? Temptation, but even the edge of the light curtain can not be explored anywhere. In this strange space, no one dares to lift off the ground. Everyone dare not act rashly. Now everyone understands that in this strange Places, the so-called sacred powerhouses are simply useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been observing the changes in the light curtain, and the analytical power is naturally launched. After a while, he said: "This light curtain is protected by certain laws, any Attacks on it will be dispersed. The greater the attack power, the larger the area that will be dispersed. In fact, no matter how we attack, it is equivalent to hard-pressing the entire surface of the light curtain, which does not play a fixed-point attack. If we can't break the power of its laws, we will never pass this light curtain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which is the light curtain set by anyone." Si couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s gaze fell on the huge blue star in the distance and said, “If it’s one of the wars, then you can lay such a light. The curtain is not strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
