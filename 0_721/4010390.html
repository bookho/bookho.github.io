			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager is not so sorry, from his choice of warfare instead of legal duties It is known that the talent in magic is not so brilliant. The Grand Duke of Tamak is one of the famous legendary powers of mankind. It is impossible to mistake the blood talent of his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there were a few big laughs. Two strong men came to the door of Richard’s residence and respectfully took a gift to Richard. Said: "Master Richard, we brought a box of good wine and sent it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up at them and looked at them Immediately said, "Oh, my two pieces are used on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, Master Richard, after the accident of Master Lawrence, We rarely see such a powerful structure, these two structures just saved our brothers' lives yesterday." The man at the left said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." Richard nodded and opened the wine sent by the two men and smelled it. It was mellow, not quite good, Li He took a big sip and then greeted the two people and said, "Let's have a few more drinks together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are smiling and sitting on the ground, also Without the other appetizers, the drunken meat began to drink, and it was a rare opportunity to drink with the masters such as Richard. Even if they did not say that they were saved indirectly by Richard, If there is a good relationship with Richard, maybe Richard will order some decorations for them. As Richards arrives in the sun, more and more powerful people know that Richard can order second-order Set of messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people chatted casually about some of the absolute battlefields and Nolan’s anecdote. The two strong men then inadvertently revealed some embarrassing momentum, some The fierce Dakso Das, as well as some of the most famous and powerful people, mentioned that the tone was just normal and they didn’t care at all. In fact, the two imitations of life were the first time that Richard The day and night are all provided by the building, and the two strong people can get them. Naturally, there are people who have the means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager listened to the blood and couldn’t help but said: "Master Richard, I can also... and, have a drink with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, be careful not to get drunk." Richard smiled and threw him a bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm already seventeen, and drinking a bit of wine is not a problem." The young man blushes and screams for himself, as if to prove that he is not bragging. He simply opened the cork and simmered a few mouthfuls, but the wines and wines brought by the two strong men were extremely strong, and the young one did not pay attention and immediately coughed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two strong men look at each other and smile, they also see the true strength of the juvenile, just do not say it, the juvenile's horns reveal the identity The information is obviously related to the Grand Duke of Tamak, and the real battlefield may lose its life all the time. The strong ones only talk about the strength of the strength, whether they look pleasing to each other, and who will go to the family when they meet. In the background, I will think so much. In this precarious world, I have to have a day to live a happy day. This is really important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, as the wine surged, the teenager gradually let go. He would talk about some of the anecdotes of the Tamarck Principality, even his own father would dare Just kidding, at the moment on the terrace of a tower in the distance, the majestic Tamak is standing on the fence. A pair of narrow eyes stare at the four people who are sitting around drinking. He is unusually tall and exceeds two meters and five. There is like a dark iron tower, a brown beard is braided into dozens of small dragonflies, fluttering in the wind, decorated with gems, metal rings, animal teeth and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the big man of Tamak, standing is the middle-aged man whom Richard once saw, and he is also watching Richard, a few kilometers away. The distance is almost the same for them. This distance is too close. If someone snoops, then both Richard and the two strong men who drink with him will immediately be aware, but this time the situation is different, Tamak Dagong and middle-aged people clearly watched them brazenly, but Li and others did nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person looks good on Richard." Tamak said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return, but my contact with him is very short, I don't understand why he did not do well with the Royal Architect, he has to go It’s not a joke place, but even you and me, it’s very likely that you will fall here.” Middle-aged humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He should have a reason, but he didn't say it. The child seems to get along well with him. I am relieved, lest he be in the field. Running around, I have to stay here for a few more days," said Tagack Dagong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man said: "Alright, although you let go and do it, I will be with Long Destedt, and there should be no problem. However, I think Richard’s potential is good, maybe it is worth putting him. I absorbed it into the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamamark Grand Duke hesitated for a moment before he shook his head: "No, he is still too young, wait for him to really Show the superior strength, and then consider this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man frowned: "But a big builder is on that plan. The meaning, you must be clearer than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, but reliability should always be in the first place, we can't afford even one betrayal. "Tamamark Dagong said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reason finally convinced the middle-aged man that he shook his head and disappeared into the door of the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that shines from the sky shines eternally on the sun and the moon, there is no day and night, the passage of time is all prompted by the magic bell of the Eternal Dragon Hall. The bell rang three times, and Richard was drunk. The boy had already fallen to the ground and slept, and the two strong men were also full of blush. On this occasion, no one would use magic or vindictiveness to resist drunkenness. Seeing that Richard began to appear sleepy, the two strong men will leave their words, do not know where to come out of several guards, and lifted the intoxicated teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of people to drink, and the rest is still lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the street, a woman dressed in a hurry, most of her face is hidden behind the leather mask, and Richard glances at her. No longer care, went back to the room, and closed the door, the woman went straight to the residence of Richard, and saw that Richard went back to the house, and when he arrived, she stood in front of the door and began to hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still open with a slit, and it is not locked, or even closed, and there is a burst of alcohol and a faint snoring from the door. It seems that Richard may have slept, or just didn't want someone to bother at this time. The woman hesitated for a while and finally put down the hand that was going to knock on the door. Instead, she took out the pen and paper and wrote a letter in a hurry, leaving an address on the envelope. Signed and placed on the stone platform at the entrance of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the woman finished this, she turned and left, and just two people rushed in. They saw this scene and turned at the door of Richard. A few laps, also left two letters, and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a night later, Richard walked out of the room and saw the three letters on the stone platform. He opened them one by one and found that the contents of the letters were similar, basically describing their special needs for certain types of construction. I hope that Richard can consider the new structure. If Richard is willing to meet their needs, they will pay an extra fee outside the normal price, and will also pay long-lasting friendship and goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows what Richard will do next frame. According to normal procedures, Richard’s construction will be sold to the day after tomorrow. Then the marshal will be assigned to the strong who needs it. In this process, a small fee will be charged for the day, but for the strong, the cost is not too much, on the battlefield. Being able to get the right fit for one day, it is equivalent to a little more hope of life, so the strong people put forward their own needs in this way, in order to impress Richard and create a structure that meets their needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has repeatedly read three letters, but read many different tastes. Richard’s ability to design and manufacture has long been proven, so he can compete. His designs are only those who are the most powerful in the day, and the demands they put are designed for the most urgent or dangerous situations on the battlefield. Reading these needs is like Providing another perspective for Richard, you can get a glimpse of the experience of these strong fighters and the experience between life and death, and their ability to demand is undoubtedly the most important special effects on the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three letters, like the three lights, illuminate a small road in a certain area in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put down three letters and thought for a long time, and then walked into the room, it was a large hall with a pile of stones in the corner Block, Richard randomly moved a stone, placed in the center, and then took out a short knife made of Lafite fine iron, but did not attach any magic effects, calmed down, slowly lifted the knife, and then cut a stone in the stone On the block, the flat knife fell, but immediately the stone fragments flew, the stone seemed to be exploded, and immediately went to a large piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fully absorbed, a knife falls, flickering, flickering, sometimes a knife can take away a dozen pounds of gravel, sometimes ten consecutive A few knives are carving a thin line of texture, and in the body of Richard, all the blood is running slowly, and sometimes it will output a force of big or small, mobilizing the various structures of Richard, and finally Mixed with physical strength and magic power, it turns into a bland and unscrupulous knife. Every knife, Richard is trying and practicing to mobilize, converge and exert the power of various attributes and the attributes of each structure. His knife can be soft if the feathers fall, or burst like a volcanic eruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
