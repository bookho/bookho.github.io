I have to tell His Highness Hastings." After that, he no longer cares about Lawrence, who is thunderous, and goes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-skinned man leaned his head slightly and did not dare to touch Lawrence’s gaze. He just said, "Sorry, Your Royal Highness, Lawrence, we did not expect Master Richard. There was actually a demon in the room. I thought it was the embers that I had not had time to escape. But I didn’t think that it would be the capture of Master Richard, but the Dakosodas were fierce and did not surrender. The precedent, you must not be fooled by their illusion on the surface."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence sighed and glanced over the faces of everyone present, among them Confused, there are hard thoughts, but most people look at the eyes of the devil, but they are full of hatred. If it is not the black and thin man who mentions the importance of the king of Danikos, I am afraid these warriors have already rushed to the black scorpion. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sudden event, and Lawrence knows that he can play a role in it. After all, he is not the sect of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-skinned man cautiously said: "His Royal Lawrence, these wounded can no longer be delayed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lawrence once again looked at the wounded, and his rich experience made him see that these people were extremely heavy. They would not be too late to do so. They were left behind in the battle with the Dax Sodas, but they should not Responsible for today's conflict, the old man sighed heavily and picked up the tooling equipment. When he saw his move, almost everyone had a long breath, and the wounded had regained their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, there was a sudden burst of air in the air, two heavily armed strongmen and a big magician flying at full speed, one of them When I fell into the courtyard, I saw the black scorpion that was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magister inspected the black scorpion and immediately revealed a surprise, saying: "Yes, it is indeed the Danicus, and it is alive. Didn't get too much damage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good." A middle-aged Sanctuary Bushido, who turned to the courtyard, most of the people Still said to Lawrence: "The Marshal has decided to requisition this Darwinos Devil, the specific compensation matters will be discussed in this evening's regular meeting, please transfer the Marshal's decision to Master Richard, this devil we Take it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three people are the direct guards of Marshal Ronald Stade, who have great authority in the fortress of the day. The words they say are equivalent to the orders of the marshals. The members of the direct Guards have always been less than ten people. Their powers are all At a price, in every battle, the most dangerous places and the most dangerous tasks can always be seen, so their loyalty to the fortress is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the requirements of the direct Guard, Lawrence was unable to refuse, only a long sigh, the old man has already felt that the follow-up of this matter will be very troublesome, because Richard The way to treat this demon is very special, and because Richard has always hated others and imposed the decision on him, Archimonde is a natural rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the Central District, Richard is looking around for the whereabouts of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only here that the end of the war is not over, the various magic elements, natural elements and planes in the space are still active and chaotic. Completely calm down, even the extremely weak and not completely disappeared, but also the soul power of disorder and consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so many strong disturbances, Richard felt that he could not determine the specific orientation of the splash, only that she was nearby, and the soul between the two There are signs that the connection is getting weaker and weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked frowning, and he realized that this weakening was not only caused by the disturbance of the power of the disorder, but also the danger of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned over a street, the front entered the core area of ​​the Central District, the scene in front of it was more messy, everywhere was fierce after the fierce battle, there are several buildings still In the smoke of the smoke, the wounded strong can be seen everywhere, many of the Sanctuary strongmen who are in the rain in Noland, now can only sit on the edge of the roadside wall like the most common wounded soldier on the battlefield. Waiting for treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still signs of explosions and large pieces of blood on the street, and even the visceral debris that has been splashed on the wall and has not been cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a thick bloody smell everywhere, and it is mixed with the scent of scent like a dead fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who can see is left with only a few young pastors of the Eternal Dragon Hall, who ran back and forth to examine the injury of a wounded person. The means of treatment were also replaced with medicinal and bandages, and they were never seen to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking priests can't see one. They have used up the magical skills. Now they all go back to the meditation inside the temple. In the upper part of the temple area, you can see the gate of the eternal dragon temple. There are rows of stretchers on the steps, which are wounded to the soldiers who can't stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, a senior priest is rushed out of the gate of the Eternal Dragon Hall. The long-awaited warriors will immediately carry a wounded person and accept The magical treatment, and the god official will return to the temple after releasing one or two gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured are not cured, and some are still being carried away. The gods of senior priests are extremely valuable. The bottom line of treatment is not to leave. In the most difficult time, the treatment of the priest can only be to save the wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team on the steps is still very long. A wounded person has endured the pain in silence, looking at the deep door of the temple, waiting for the priests who symbolize the hope of survival. appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, Richard is not the first time to see it, even his own, now rely on the resilience of the body to heal the wound, in the law Luo Shi’s extravagance from the sacred official is no longer enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a post-war scene will make Richard’s heart shake once every time he sees it, and on the other hand, he will worry more and speed up his mind. Looking for the speed of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no good way, only one person can ask the past and ask if they have seen the girl like that. This is the most stupid way, but It is the most effective way in the current chaotic situation. There are no logistical and support personnel in the fortress, and no more than 10,000 people. As long as you patiently search and investigate, take more time and you will find the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now anxious that the water flower is not seriously injured, even if she is found, can she get timely treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, many people recognize Richard, the royal faculty of the Holy Alliance is the one who wants to get to know each other, they are very enthusiastic to answer Lee Inquiries, even some people eagerly wanted to accompany Richard to find, but when they saw their injuries, Richard refused and continued to look for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard once again left a bunch of strong people sitting around the campfire, suddenly his expression was stagnation, his connection with the water flower was suddenly completely interrupted, this time He can be surely cut off by external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard only felt a rising flame in his heart, and his eyes were slightly dizzy, and then ran wildly on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the depths of the main hall, Hasting cleaned his hands and wiped the dripping sweat from his forehead and sat down in his seat. Slowly closed his eyes and tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array on the stone platform is all lit up, and the light forms a transparent mask that holds the girl in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl fell asleep deeply, and her body's magical structure was extinguished when it was, like a dreamlike beauty, above her body, another translucent The girl's image is exactly the same as her face. The illusory girl is like a wolf, sometimes crouching for a long time, like waiting for her prey. More often, she is stunned by a person, and she seems to be ignorant. Where to go, sometimes she will curl up and warm herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the soul of the flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting slowly opened his eyes and glanced at the sleeping girl on the stage, closing his eyes again. "I didn't expect to have this in her soul." There are many rare forces, and the soul guardian exists. Hey, it seems that this little girl is not simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage tapped the armrests twice, one The old man, who was squatting, slowly walked out of the darkness. He groped for a locker in the darkness, poured out a small bowl of bloody things, and handed it to Hastings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he approached the legendary mage, the dim torch in the hall illuminated the old man's face. He had a pair of empty eyes and no eyes at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin took the bowl of black blood and drank it all, which made it feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a footstep sounded outside the hall, and the three marshals directly guarded the guards of the guards to announce their ranks and names, and then entered the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the great magician gave a ceremonial ritual to Hasting, respectfully said: "His Highness, I have confirmed that the demon is indeed Da Nicklos. Family, and almost intact, I have brought it to you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
