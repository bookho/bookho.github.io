			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness before dawn, Richard was from the blanket on the ground Sit up and end the half-hour rest and nap. He sorted out the armor equipment, and then called the rest of the followers, then turned the horse and took them to the night at full speed. Behind Richard, the squad's sand cavalry and barbarian warriors also climbed from the ground and continued to pursue the viscount's troops under the leadership of an elite fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, Richard is almost the same person on the horseback, and the extremely high speed of the horse makes the wind coming out of the face extremely cold. He almost sprinted at full speed, and the squad was marching at a super high speed along the route outlined by Richard. Without any accident, Richard knew that after half an hour he could stop the Viscount of the escaped. At that time, the Viscounts should be surrounded by only the confidant guards. Most of the soldiers will be left behind, otherwise they will not be able to stop the bombardment of dozens of throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Richard is only a few followers, but at the scheduled interception point, there are already dozens of wind teeth waiting there. Even if the viscount of the squad of Hem is out of the sky, if he breaks through again, then if he can't run for a few kilometers, he will hit the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the Viscount was decided at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Viscount Hib looked palely at Richard, who was out from the morning, and his lips trembled, and he could not say anything. The gloomy guard captain slammed into the side of Richard and followed a few followers. His eyes suddenly lit up and he whispered something in the ear of the Viscount. So the face of the number of bright red flushes on the face of the priest of Shim, screaming with a pointed sharp voice: "Yes, there are not many people around him. Our number is several times his number! Don't be afraid, everyone. Give me a rush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very calmly looking around, following him to participate in this interception only two ogres, Gangde, water, There are a few followers of the sand, and there are four of the strongest barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogrets and barbarians find it difficult to find mounts that can carry them, but they are races growing up in the wilderness, powerful individual forces that allow them to travel long distances. The speed in the game is not lost to the war horse. This is why the Viscounts of Him has tried his best to pursue, but he has never been able to catch up with Richard, who also has ‘infantry.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are nearly 30 escorts around the Viscount, and the Guard Captain has 14 powers, so relying on the huge advantage of the number, The Viscount is determined to fight for the final strength and to make a full blow and kill a bloody road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Ning was looking at the opposite face of the face, and the keen sense made him hear the viscount of the Viscount: "We have more people! They!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help but smile, this Him is not stupid enough to come home, seeing himself appearing from his front, knowing that he is not at all in speed Dominant, so there is no choice to escape, but to use only the number of advantages to want to defeat themselves. Choosing to escape in front of a big magician and leaving the back to the opponent is really a bad idea, because magic is always faster than people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people are there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small-scale battle, he still retains most of the magic of Richard, and naturally has unparalleled control over the battlefield. Richard calmly dismissed the book and took out the book of the bearing, releasing the remaining six levels of natural summons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of magic, a total of twelve violent bears straddle between Him and Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the twelve violent bears that suddenly appeared in front of him, Him suddenly felt that there was a blank in his brain. Twelve violent bears, that is at least four or five six-level natural summons to get enough, the big magician who can release so many six levels of magic, just a step away from the magician! Is it a quasi-magic teacher who has been chasing himself? After the Viscount is determined to return to the territory, he must punish the person responsible for the intelligence and formally provide support to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare is not over yet. As the magical energy surges, the Viscount sees six violent bears on the left and right, now twenty-four The violent bear surrounded the viscount of the Viscount. Twenty-four violent bears, more than 30 Guardians of the Viscounts have to spend a lot of time to deal with them, let alone those who are extremely wicked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the violent bears began to roar and rushed to the desperate Viscount, he fainted wisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him is fortunate because he doesn’t see dozens of giant wolves that have just emerged from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard Captain and the Guards have seen the new wolves, and intuition tells them that this is also the summoning creature of Richard, and looks at the fainting Viscount, then decisively surrendered. Fortunately, the wind and the violent bear are controlled by Richard, otherwise it is a one-sided slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Viscount whispered, the eye was Richard’s face that would appear in his nightmare, so he immediately screamed, his voice Sharp and fierce like a little girl who will be raped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Gao’s screams scared Richard, and then he looked at the viscount back and forth and crawled back and forth. Seeing Kim's extremely frightened expression, Li couldn't help but touch his face. He wondered if he was awakened by the blood of Archimonde and became the face of the demon lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... don't come over! Don't take off my clothes!" The scream of the Viscount made Richard's face change rapidly. And not only the followers of Richard, but even the visceral guards of the Viscounts looked at Richard's eyes with a lot of unclear things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Faro, the real wealthy aristocrats often play all the tricks at a young age, think about it, the fresh tricks that can be played are left. Man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the two men in front are facing each other, although there are not many scenes of screaming, they cannot say less. It’s just normal if the scream is Richard. Now the screaming is the Viscount. In the eyes of the viscounts, the taste of Richard is a bit too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are even more convinced that after the last time the Viscounts returned to the territory, they went crazy and gathered private arms at the fastest speed, even waiting for the family to promise to transfer When several of his strong men arrived, they set off with the army. Now the performance of the Viscount is more realistic. What happened between them. Last time, the Viscount finally secretly executed all the intimate guards, so no one knows the specific scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t have to look back, I can feel the smile of the sand, and I am a little angry and angry, and shouted to Him: "Shut up!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him is louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the initiative and asked Gangde to mention Him, and took him to an unmanned open space in the forest and hung him on the big tree. So the witnesses who witnessed everything suddenly became extremely ugly and began to worry about their fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
