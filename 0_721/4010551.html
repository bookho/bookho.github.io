			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in the world that kills, in front of this knife, The defensive defensiveness, the heavy body and the powerful vitality that Fenglu is proud of have all lost their functions. The bear body attached to the nail piece is easily cut open like butter, although Fenglu does not dare to move, but 斩The power of killing is still raging in his body, destroying pieces of flesh and blood, bones and internal organs, and then smashing into the body with flesh and blood. Maple madly mobilizes the power of Druid against the destruction of the killing, but His power was not comparable to that of Richard, and a large number of Druid's natural forces can only consume a small part of the continuous destructive power of killing, so the blood spurts heavily, and the horrible wounds continue to expand. After spreading over half of the bear's body, Fenglu finally couldn't stand, and fell to the ground. The shock of the fall further tore the wound, and only a small part of the flesh and blood in the upper and lower body could be connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maple dew has been unable to maintain the bear form and has returned to the human form. At this time, he has only a low voice, and the other two Aoya elders are stunned. After a while, he turned around without saying a word, and three people could not deal with Richard. If they wanted to stay, they would only end up with Fenglu. The two elders fled in two directions, respectively. In the same way, Richard sighed reluctantly and chased down the elder who had better battle power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard returned to the side of Feng Lu, carrying the head of the green leaf elder, and Feng Lu’s vitality was extremely tenacious, until then There is no death, the slain of Yu Wei has passed, and Feng Lu’s body has been divided into two sections. The green light spots of the stars are lingering in the upper part of the wound, but at this moment, unless another big Druid casts a level of nine Natural magic, otherwise Maple will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the maple dew, and there was a slight regret in his heart. This guy is not the general guardian elf, but the son of the forest. If he took it, he would feed the nest. In the case of the mother's nest, it is helpful to adapt to the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha gently shakes the elf knife, ending the pain of Fenglu, and chasing Mei Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few kilometers away, Melin is hiding in the lush crown of the tree, clinging to the longbow, keeping an eye on all the movements in the forest, she can’t tell The purpose of stopping yourself is to ambush or wait for someone. The ambush is obviously not a good choice. As far as the status of the Yongye tribe is concerned, even if you know the attempt of Aoba, it is also a good choice to pretend that it is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Mei Lin suddenly felt a slight difference behind her, and she turned back with a bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, it is me." Richard appeared from a tree not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline was surprised again: "How did you find the Aoba tribe here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "They don't know what's going on. The three people actually came to chase me together. Fortunately, I knew a secret path, and this escaped with trepidation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin silently, as a daughter of the forest, she never knew the existence of a hidden path, she was just inexperienced, not stupid, naturally Richard was a very good guy, and her heart fretting, asking: "What are you going to do next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for more trees of life, The more trees I see, the better my strength grows. I am going to rise to the 19th level in this plane, and then I will leave here and explore the other planes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard said is common sense in Noland, not in Green Forest, most of the guardian elves here may not know that there are ectopic faces. However, Melin heard, but there was no such thing as a strange expression. It seems that she had long heard of the plane to explore such things. She hesitated and asked: "Licha, if you can live on the tree of life in the night of Yongye Time, can you help the Yongye tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Richard did not hesitate to answer, even did not ask the latter conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline hesitated for a long time, and finally rushed with Richard to the direction of the Yongye tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of rushing, the two were inevitably intercepted by tribes such as the wind language. This time, Richard no longer keeps his hands, and uses long swords and magic. , wiped out all the hunters who dare to intercept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from Aoba to Yongyin tribe is quite far. On the way, Richard continues to delve into the rules of the tree of life and finally resolves the 1024th rule. The analysis of this rule immediately took a big step forward in the understanding of Richard's scattered, like a piece of jigsaw puzzle composed of more than 60,000 pieces. The original Richard was scattered in the puzzle piece. The 1024th rule is the key to connecting nearby debris. Richard silently meditates that the veil that blocks the natural forces has been uncovered. Now Richard is more than just a magic or an attack in his own. Add a little life force, and you can see through the enemy's use of natural and life forces, greatly enhancing the resistance to natural forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Richard received the news of the hen's nest avatar, it has reached the fourth order, and then promoted to the first order, you can add the spirit resistance attribute to the created combat unit, so that the combat unit's resistance to the forest will be greatly Ascension, the fourth-order nest is still chosen to increase the ability to create combat units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the mother's nest is located has already had a large open space. Compared with the entire forest, this piece of land with a few hundred meters square is more than a sand. It’s small, but if you think that the tall trees that were originally built on the open space are all in the belly of the nest, you don’t think the space is small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of worker bees are moving around and eating everything they can eat, the nest is split from the center of the open space, leaving behind ten An erected egg, after a moment, this will be twenty new worker bees. The mother's nest is ten meters long and two meters high. It slowly climbs to a tree that has been dragged by worker bees. Chewing finely, from time to time, a worker bee flies over and spits out a piece of dense wax that is formed for the mother's nest to enjoy. The twilight lies on the back of the nest, boringly watching the sky is always dark, the forest is extremely wet. Let her armor be covered with dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随 随How about a fire on your back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a body, the flame will burn through my insects."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯 随 随 在 在 在 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 戳 在 在 在This texture is a little bit harder than wood. You are not prepared to increase defense at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a master and you are, now I don't need Adding defense, it is you, why not try to improve the combat power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels a little tired." The twilight sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So lying down, nothing can be obtained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色坐了Get up and say, "Protect you is my current job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is eating and saying: "When you protect me, you can practice." Technology, the ontology has given you the soul, and with the soul you can rely on your own evolution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if we are free and independent, what are we going to do?" asked the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a distant goal, but before that, we must first live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Live..." The darkness of the thoughts, deep in her soul, the soaking sound of the sobbing, has been craving for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is not so many thoughts, just desperately eating, desperately growing and advanced, the roaring footsteps in the forest, tiramisu The magic crystal needed to raise the mother's nest from the fourth order to the fifth order is brought over. There is also a ten-unit divine crystal, which is enough to be used for the promotion of the ranks. Now the only thing that needs to be done is to keep growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to the consumption of insects and defenses. The speed of avatar growth is several times that of the original body, and the body has already put its own front nine steps when gestating the body. The evolutionary experience is sealed in the soul of the avatar, so it takes a few days or even months for the ontology to complete the process of the promotion. It takes only one-third or even less time to divide here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard and Melin have come to the Yongye tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yongyue tribe is indeed different from other guardian elves. From the distinctive architectural style, it can be seen that a beautiful wooden house is not only built in life. The tree is also built around the tree of life, forming a small village centered on the tree of life. Every building in the village has beautiful and exquisite sculptures or patterns, exquisite and elegant. At first glance, the art with a long history has been different from the original art of the guardian elves. What surprised Richard was that he actually saw a moon in the middle of the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear well in the moon, and from time to time a little bit of floating light rises from the surface of the water, and if it flows in the air, it floats and dances to the moon well. Surrounded by a mysterious and magnificent atmosphere, the distance is very far away. Richard feels the rich monthly force that comes out of the moon. This is a universal moon well. There is no special preference for any string in the seven-string moon. Some of them are impure and impure, and the degree of richness is not as heavy as that recorded in the Elf Code. However, it is already shocking to see the Moon Well in Green Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the Greenson plane is always dark, there is no sun, no moon and stars, and the corresponding monthly force becomes quite weak, Li The blood of the elf has been developed to a very high degree, so that it can successfully sense the force of the string moon in Greensen, and use the elf secret sword. The moon well appears in the Yongye tribe, indicating that the tribe can also sense the moon. The people of force, and not only the induction, but the mastery of the ancient inheritance of the upper elves, can successfully build the moon well, the moon well is not just what the elves can build, the elves in the history of Noland The empire, the standard for dividing the upper elves is to see if it can build a well of the crescent moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
