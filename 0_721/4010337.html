Throughout the afternoon, Faust was dead, and then when the night fell, it began to boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is centered on the fascinating world, and it is transmitted to all directions in the shadow of the night. It instantly reaches all corners of the mainland. At this moment, Richard has become The center of concern throughout the mainland, fear, admire and even want to destroy him is unprecedented, but Richard is not a sacred killer at this time can easily succeed, as the legendary strong, but because For the sake of His Highness, Su Hailun, he would not easily take a shot at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless giants meeting in the evening to discuss the adjustment of the strategy of dealing with Archimonde, more wise men began collecting all the information about Richard in the first time In an attempt to break the secrets of the corps that Richard’s saga is called by magic, when the morning comes, there are already wise men who point out that perhaps the secret is in the success rate of Richard, and he must have a very capable assistant, even It is an assistant group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have fallen into complete panic and have never slept all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But until the next morning, the army that Soren and Goliath arranged near the Black Rose Castle not only did not evacuate, but was increasing their troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard heard the news, he just said a faint sentence: "Akmund is Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s impact on the alliance is still spreading, and in many ways has had a subtle influence, such as the information he has been trying to check, just in the second In the early morning, I was sent to the floating island by my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat in the study room, some casually read a few secret letters, at this moment the study room is crowded with followers, so that the originally very spacious study room becomes It is quite crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly swept through the first piece of information and said: "The killer identity of the last assassination of me has been detected. This is the information of his family, um, I will hand over this information to the night dancers and offer a reward. The top 5,000 gold coins are good for everyone.” “Dark Dancer”, one of the two organizations in the dark world, has a reputation for hundreds of years, and there is also The pride of the king of the dark world is only for the existence of a true status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural took over the information, and this kind of thing is now handled by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second piece of information made Richard a little surprised. He looked at it several times before he looked up at Lina and said, "Lina, it seems The Count of Cardiff not only looked at your people, but also looked at your makeup. He had been close to Luno for a while, and I heard that Luno wanted to get your unique makeup, at least It is a design plan to break through the fourth-order bottleneck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say, recalling the last experience, and The words that Cardiff said to her suddenly only felt the false nausea that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took the information and shredded it into the waste basket and said, "This is already over, and that Cardiff doesn't know." Where did you stay, the last time he made him almost ruined, it was enough to teach him enough, this kind of person does not need to kill, living will make him more painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Richard picked up the third and last piece of information and looked at it for a while. He wanted to tear it off. He thought about it and let it go. He handed the list to Oral and told him to accept it. Ok, I have a chance to use it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This list records the final flow of most of the sacrifices during the family floating island riots, although the sacrifices originally fell on who did not This list is listed, and some of the families who buy sacrifices are indeed uninformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this list is still very useful, at least when Richard announced that it was in hand, according to the rules of the nobility, many families who bought the sacrifices had to The sacrifices are spit out, or compensation is made to Archimonde in disguise. As for their losses, it is the price of buying a thief. Of course, this rule will only work when Archimonde is strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, followers are a little eager to wait. They have been fighting for the past year, but few have gathered around Richard and killed together. At first, a few people who followed Richard often felt emotionally, and felt that it was more fun to be chased by the time when they arrived at Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li was sitting on his desk, his eyes swept through a large number of followers, and smiled: "I can't wait." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Gangde is still the most anxious one, screaming: "The most comfortable with the head, just cut people, nothing else." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry, wait a few more days, our people have not arrived yet, I have ordered a batch of equipment for you, one or two Days can be delivered, two epic equipment per person, this time is fair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, how to fight." Gangde is obviously anxious Resist, he is not very interested in what equipment, except the big axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still necessary to prepare." Richard laughed and felt the beard that had become almost as hard as the steel needle, saying, "We push the past." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes are bright: "Push, I like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I like it too." There was a dull voice coming out of the door, and it sounded echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the study was slammed open, and it was Tiramisu who came in. The Ogre ** was originally over four meters high and could not squeeze into the passage of the castle, but now the double-headed ogres are actually Only about one meter eight, it seems quite lovely between the left and the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard immediately rounded his eyes and screamed: "You used a reduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes." Tiramisu clutched his head, and both faces showed stunnedness and did not understand what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, there is only one minute of reduction without super magic effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰The sound of the smog in front of everyone, the gravel fly ash everywhere, the height of the ogre restored the original size, two heads directly hit the ceiling, obviously, the castle of wood stone structure is far from the head of the ogre Hard, the floor of the top of Tiramisu was directly pierced, and its three eyes were still looking around. I don't understand why Richard and his friends suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard’s angry shot, a zoom out with a lot of super magic effects, made the cannibalist only one meter in size, like a fat toot. The delicate doll, then Richard flew up and kicked the cannibalist out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there has been a catastrophe in the study, to know that when everyone changes, the first reaction is to protect themselves, so all kinds of vindictive, The magic shield is brilliant, but for the ordinary furniture in the study, it is simply an irresistible storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, all the wood becomes slag, and all paper is turned into a butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, all are scattered, take a few days off, don't give me a face when you fight." Richard blew the followers. Go out and stay alone in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone left, Richard stood in the debris of the ground, revealing a bit of a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the study that Gotton left, he may have been in a hurry, many things have not been sorted out, desks, chairs, magic sandbox, all planes The maps are still in use, and it seems that the owner will walk in from the door at the next moment, and then carry out another campaign deduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There aren't many books and scrolls on the bookshelf, but each one is chosen by Gotton and placed here. I read it from time to time. The texture of the parchment, the edge of the page has been turned a bit hairy, and the rare World of Warcraft is in the face. After a lot of strokes, the parts became particularly bright, let go of the text, and some of the markup notes left by Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not noticed that many of his habits are actually subconsciously imitating Gotton, and then unconsciously become his habit, this man, It may be difficult to tell where he is strong, but it always leaves an indelible memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, everything is gone with the savage spells of the Ogre Magi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a scab, Richard is surprisingly calm, not sentimental, nor angry at the ogre, just like destroying one of the most The same as a normal room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly smiled, shook his head, strode out of the study, told the butler to call someone to repair it, the standard is according to the top giants, when the old steward At the time of his life, Richard thought about it again and changed his mouth to let him renovate the entire castle. As for the standard, it is four words: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the old butler’s expression, Richard smiled and said: “This is like a nouveau riche, isn’t it, do what I say, what only Choose expensive, don't choose the right one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the castle gate, Richard suddenly felt a moment of unspeakable ease. It turned out that he did not need to rely on it. Those external things come to speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows the man very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, when Semir and Achilles rushed back from the plane, they saw a family castle that had become a construction site, and they could not help but blaspheme. I wonder if I am going wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small military camp, the crowded knights and elite knights in the small military camps made their eyes straight, this time they really began to doubt themselves. The eyes are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can think of the second-order suit knight, who actually wants four people to squeeze a tent, in contrast, eight people squeeze one The front knight is not so dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
