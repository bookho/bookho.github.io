			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was suddenly torn by an amber brilliance, it was a round The moon, which was formed by the secret force, is slowly rising in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind tribe warrior who loves the night is of course recognizing that it is the second string of amber moon, but how will the amber month appear in this? At the time, and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it is less than three meters from this group of fighters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind warriors only watched the quiet standing of the moon under the ray of light, and it was already late, because in the hands of Richard, Sprinkle a piece of lemon yellow with a dark red light, just around the body for a week, forming a halo of up to ten meters in diameter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves secret sword, the ring of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the aura passes, the soldiers of the Night Wind tribe are silently divided into two, no matter what expression they have on their faces before they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second string of amber moon slowly fades away, the night finally sounds a screaming and helpless trombone, so the rustling sounds, the outer ring still has The few surviving night wind tribe warriors quietly retired in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smashed the annihilation, but failed to smash any blood drop from the blade. I do not know why, the time of extinction in the hands of Richard, seems to be quietly changing, at least now, in addition to the flesh and blood of the real strong, no matter how many people killed, it is always bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sigh of relief and the lava in his eyes was unwilling to cool. He went to the place where he had rested, inserted the scabbard into the erected scabbard, and sat down to begin meditation. The rich blood around him seems to have no effect on him, and those carnivores still dare not approach this battlefield, just as there are their natural enemies here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hours later, the dark clouds in the sky quietly dispersed, and it was another day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has recovered most of his magic power, so he got up and stared at the star of the day and continued to go deep into the continent of Calando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much time, there is no difference between staying up late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time he is still in a straight line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same night, the forest in the distance is roaring, the earth is not only tremor, it is simply awkward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is running wild in the forest, holding a giant egg in her hands that is almost as big as herself. Behind her, the towering old trees are falling down in rows, and the mist is coming. In the fog, an incomparably huge body is rapidly twisting and chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of meters in the sky, several giants are looming in the clouds, from time to time issued a very angry snoring! The snoring is long and long. If the waves are empty, they will roll in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest is already boiling, the birds are desperately flapping their wings, and the beasts only know that they are rushing forward, they are desperately trying to leave the snoring far away. When the snoring sounds out of the air, only the most fierce raptors can continue to flee, and others are either falling from the air, or the ground is soft, and they can no longer move, only shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are running faster and faster, and they often fly a bunch of beasts that are in the way. But no matter how fast she runs, the behemoths in the fog in the rear are still the same. Every time it fell, the earthquake trembled, and the beasts on the ground would bounce a meter or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the dawn of the day, the mountains and the sea finally came out of the forest and came to the wasteland. She cheered, the speed increased sharply, and she rode the dust and went away instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of old trees in the outermost part of the forest roared and fell, and then stepped on by the giant foot! The behemoth finally showed its true body. It was nearly 100 meters high, and the four pillar-like giant feet supported the body. On the torso, there are nine heads with distinctly different shapes! The long neck puts nine heads in the air on hundreds of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behemoth looked at the direction of the mountains and the sea, and made a very angry and helpless mania, and the tail twitched, I don’t know how many towering trees were drawn. . After completely ruining the entire forest, it turned helplessly and slowly walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is finally coming, the burning glow of the half-day smeared a thick layer of red on the entire Calando continent, and the birds and beasts gradually sounded, and the mainland was awakened. Regained vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard walks at a constant pace, his breathing is long and long, and he will breathe once for a long time. At his feet, the terrain is slowly rising and the wind is getting stronger. When the wind rushes from the ear, you can hear the bleak whistling, like the ancient war of the barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of Richard, stands a huge ancient tree. The trunk of the ancient tree is engraved with traces of the years. The sparse branches at the top are also covered with green patches. Just like any life on this continent, it is hard but tenacious to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the tree, sitting on a barbarian youth. He is not very burly. From the barbarian encounters along the way, he can only be regarded as a medium-sized figure, but every muscle in his body is as hard and concise as steel, and even has an illusion of inorganic texture. The barbarian youth is dark and not as yellowish brown as other barbarian warriors. His eyes were slightly stunned, and a blade of grass was chewing in his mouth. It seemed that he had not fully woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has stopped and his eyes are on the young man, his face showing a dignified color for the first time, and a decisive decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man does not seem to see Richard, still leaning on the trunk, the grass leaves occasionally flipping in his mouth, his eyes moving, that is, avoiding Richard’s direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard’s eyes suddenly spurted a faint glow, the young man, like a needle, snorted and slammed from the ground, then Falling on the ground like a stone statue, his feet fell deeply into the earth, as if his body had dozens of tons of weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth put away the playful look on the face, seriously looking at Richard, his eyes gradually become serious and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any action, he suddenly stood on the ground and seriously took a ritual to Richard with the barbaric etiquette, then stood up straight and stood up like a javelin. Said: "I am the Baalibali of the Scorpio tribe, I have been waiting for you here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are better than those of the seventh, The first three, the first warrior is too strong," Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba has dismissively said: "What are you talking about, the tribes of the wind, the wind and the night wind? There is no strength in the wind and wasteland. Big tribe, where can you compare with the Scorpio tribe? I don't need any title at all, as long as I can stand, other people in the family can only fight for the second!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said, "When you are waiting here, I am not afraid that I will be cleaned up by the little tribes and will not be able to win the glory of those who have broken down the agreement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bali Ba Li grinned and revealed his white teeth, saying: "If those little tribes can knock you down, it means you have no glory to knock down. So I only wait here, I believe the mountain. And the people who are looking under the sea, will not have the ability to stand in front of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I am coming."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba has a gaze like electricity and stabs Richard: "But you will stop here too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And it is a challenge? You are a fighter of the 18th level." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome face of Baalibali actually has a twilight, asking: "How old are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About nineteen!" said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal’s face was embarrassed, then he punched his fist and shouted: “That’s good! I’m using fifteenth power and You fight, our barbarian warriors never bother to participate in unfair challenges! If you win me, then I will never stop you again, and will not participate in the battle of agreement four years later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still use all your strength, otherwise you must regret it." Richard faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal squinted his eyes and looked at Richard, frowning and said: "But you are only 14th-level magic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "There is not a sentence in your barbarians. Isn't the level the only standard for the Warriors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba Force is a simple person, immediately said: "Good! I am like a real warrior, and you fight with all your strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the elf and extinction Two long knives were inserted on the ground, about ten meters apart, and only the fate of the twins was mentioned in the hand, and the battering force was abruptly opposed to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal has some doubts about Richard’s move to the ground, but not much attention, in fact, his self-defense weapon for a magician It’s a long knife, or two, and I can’t tell the weirdness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li waited for Richard to finish all the preparations. After standing still, he pulled out the waist knife and slowly pointed to the front. Compared with the heavy machete that the barbarian used to use, Baalibali's knife is more narrow and long. It seems that it is the road of equal skill, speed and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly raised a long knife and shouted, a step has crossed the range of ten meters, appeared in front of Richard, long knife like electric shot down! Richard was completely unable to dodge and was cut by a long knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after the knife was over, Richard’s figure was actually blurry and broken, but it was just a phantom. Baaliba Li quickly turned around and saw four more identical Richards around him. The left hand was holding a big book with a cover on the cover, and the pages were flipping fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian youth shouted loudly, long knife like Haiyan swept the waves, lightning bolted out four knives! There were three knives in the four knives, and three phantoms were shredded, but the body of Richard flashed the knife light, and at the same time, a flash of lightning fell in the air, and the head squatted on the head of Baalibali. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
