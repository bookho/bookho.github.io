Richard said to no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faceless shrugs and hands, helplessly said: "I know you won't let me rest! Need the king of war?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First don't! If Bahamut comes, it won't be late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard vacated, There was a striking glare on the body, and Midrande, who had a red-brown pattern in the blink of an eye, had already appeared on the battlefield. The sword of the Holy Flame in his hand began to burn the blood of the blazing flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of a flash has crossed the kilometer and appeared on the battlefield zhōng yāng. The Great Flame of the Flame brings a bloody ray, and it lingers from a wind-powered dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon screams with earth-shattering, and the dragon's torso is almost cut! The dragon's blood sprayed like rain, and it struggled a few times. He fell from the air and fell heavily on the ground, never moving again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole battlefield suddenly stopped quietly, even if the opponents who were fighting were unable to slow down their hands, and they suddenly appeared in the air wearing red and white double armor. The figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard at the moment is completely hidden in the armor of the armor. On the helmet mask, Midron’s majestic and determined face replaces his beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now standing in the air is the king of angels in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, the three pairs of red sè's light wings loomed, then gathered around and disappeared. The Great Flame sword swung in front of him for a few weeks, then straight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the king of angels, it seems that there is a ground of nothingness, the holy sword is deeply inserted into the ground, and the crack of the blood is spread out in all directions with the holy sword as the center. Outline the imaginary ground of Richard’s footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield zhōng yāng, Licha 拄 sword stands, just like the gods come! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short moment has been seen by everyone. Many legendary powerhouses are full of surprises at the moment: the six-winged angel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is also a glimpse, then the mask on the corner of the mouth, the eyebrows fluttering, revealing a playful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she whispered whistling and said, "I haven’t seen you for a long time, I can’t see you still have such a hand! Birds with six wings, this It’s rare to see it! Well, look at your hard work, I have to be serious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless figure also disappears in the void, Then appeared silently on the battlefield. The place she came out was very strange, just below the dragon. Then her double sword was like a viper, deeply pierced between the legs of the dragon, and when she turned everything, she got a big piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly became a stalemate, and looked up to the sky, giving a tragedy of extreme pain and extreme panic, and then fell into a state of madness. Indiscriminately catching bites, dragons are sprayed everywhere, regardless of whether there is anyone, or who is on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face disappears quietly, and I don’t know where to hide. In fact, in terms of the shape of the dragon, she cut only a small piece of meat, about ten kilograms. Like 水sè and water flowers, the double-faced swords are not long enough, the lethality is limited accordingly, and there is no terrible effect of Richard’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the place where there is no face knife is too yīn damage, this dragon is suddenly smashed a little. This kind of injury, even if it is lighter, is absolutely unbearable. Even if you rely on powerful vitality to regain the vital parts in the future, the function will be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the horrible appearance of this dragon, all the dragons suddenly felt a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the other dragon in the distance seemed to be smashed like a butt, and a strange scream called a hundred meters directly into the sky. Then there was a painful roll there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face appears quietly in the original position of the dragon, Shuangjian Jianfeng blood. She glanced at the dragon in the air and was hidden in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a female dragon, but its pain is absolutely no less than that of the male dragon, she is really ass being shackled, and almost smashed by the legendary double sword. Regardless of the dragon dragon, this is a very fragile key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But usually the human strong is definitely not going to attack this part, the power of the dragon tail sweep is not even the legendary strong people do not want to try. However, the no-face action was a ghost. After a hit, the back of the dragon's tail was wiped out without even her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the instantaneous transmission of jīng, no face is far above the legendary Master Richard. If Richard dares to do this, most of the time he has just sent it out, he will be slammed on the face by the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face and rushed to the third dragon, she was hidden, and then appeared again. But this time she looked helpless and actually did not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a young and majestic male dragon, it’s the peak of physical strength. As soon as it disappears, it immediately instinctively closes the hind paws and clamps the tail. In this way, there is no way to start without a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons learn very fast in the face of unprecedented threats. As long as no face disappears, the dragons will close their claws and protect their buttocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, many dragons simply fought with their tails. Although this greatly affects the flexibility of the flight, it is always better than the key points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of the face of the limelight, the battlefield zhōng yāng suddenly lit up a blood sè lightning! The Richard Sword was pulled up and rushed to the nearby dragon at an incredible speed. The blood sè was stunned by the unstoppable momentum, and the huge faucet was flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon is actually beheaded by a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha figure flashed, and returned to the battlefield zhōng yāng, standing on the sword, like a statue that has never been moved. Even the flow rate of the red sè on the armor began to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since entering the battlefield, Richard has only two swords, but a sword kills a dragon, leaving the opponent with no resistance. Subconsciously, all the dragons are far away from Richard, and there is a large area in the battlefield zhōng yāng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is at rest! Attack, don't let him recover!" An old dragon suddenly cried and then took the lead to Richard! Other dragons have realized their enlightenment and rushed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li snorted and his figure moved again, directly impacting the old dragon. His momentum is like the wind, no speed at all, but directly hit the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dull collision sound over the valley of the Dragon. Both the dragon and the human strong felt the heart pumping. This feeling is like slamming into a mountain at full speed, even if it is a dragon, I don't want to try this kind of taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dragon was actually hit by Richard! His size is hundreds of times larger than Richard! Although Richard is also flying backwards, the kind of ants hit the elephant, but how people think it feels awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dragon is stiff and has been hit by a hundred meters, which stabilizes the body. However, there was a horrible deep hole in the chest, and the dragon's blood sprang up, and it could not stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the collision between the two sides, Richard waved the Great Flame sword and slammed a sword on his chest. Although the dragon's body is strong, it still looks vulnerable before the artifacts from heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha a sword hits the old dragon, and then the holy sword flies, such as the spine of the blood sè steamer, killing the other ice dragon. In the twinkling of an eye, this ice dragon is wounded all over the body, and the wounds are deep visible in the bones! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword of the Great Flame of the Holy Spirit is more than two meters long. When dealing with the huge creatures such as the dragon, the power can be much larger than the human sword of the general size. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wind dragon is quietly coming from behind Li, but it hasn’t had any action yet, and suddenly there are a few thorns on his body. On the dragon wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thorn formed by natural magic, not only can restrain the action, but also add damage. But for the dragon, the additional damage is naturally negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dragon of the wind dragon shakes, these magical thorns are scattered, and then turn around to find out which weak worm, actually dare at this time Sneak attack on yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several thorns have just been dispelled, more thorns have emerged, and a period of barbaric growth, quickly tied the wind dragon firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Feng Long finally saw the sneak attack on his own people. It was a group of jīng Ling Druids who did not know when they appeared on the battlefield. Every Druid's strength is very weak, only fifteen, and stronger than sixteen. However, the wind dragon sucked a cold air and finally understood why he was bound by an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jīngThe number of Ling Druids is too much, up to five hundred! Five hundred Druids together, any dragon under the force of Bahamut will be directly bound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind dragon suddenly felt chilly and found that Richard didn’t know when it appeared in front of him, and his right hand raised the holy flame to frame it and bite it. The mouth, the left hand pulls out the moonlight, relying on the jīng spirit holy sword is better than the holy flame sword, and it is easy to break the dragon scale of its neck, straight into the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at his own results and turned to the other dragon. This is the head metal dragon. When Richard came to fly, it was still zì yóu. When Licha appeared in front of it, the dragon was covered with thorns all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shackles of this point are already fatal. Richard Sword smashed the metal dragon and turned to find the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the dragons have discovered the terrible threat of these Druids, and a wind dragon uses his own speed to open his opponent and directly fight this Ruyi. Just let it rush into the formation of Druid, it will cause terrible killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the outermost dozens of jīng spirits stopped casting, and they took a strange weapon from behind, using six long metal tubes with a flash of cold light. The wind-powered dragon that has been rushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind dragons almost photographed them, the long metal tubes in the hands of the jīngling suddenly swirled, and dozens of long flames spouted. The instant roar overwhelmed all the sounds on the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelming metal projectile bombarded the dragon, easily tore its dragon scales, burning its flesh and blood, and with great habits Squeezed deep into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of dozens of Thor’s fires is enormous, and the bullets that can kill the Sanctuary’s mighty bombs are full of flesh and blood. The huge impact made its dragons jump up, jumped over the Druid array, and then fell heavily on the ground, plowing a long trajectory on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
