			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the footsteps, Link opened his eyes and saw that it was Richard Come in, the eyes flashed with sternness and disdain, and closed your eyes again, asking: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger saw Link, excited to grab In the previous step, he said: "Master Link, the Duke has decided to redeem you. Now that the ransom has been paid, you will be free soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;林When I glanced, my face was full of suspiciousness and said, "This is impossible. Richard will never let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, he looked at him faintly, threw the ransom list and the trading contract and said, "This is your worth, you can look at it." I don't know when Richard had a small magic scroll in his hand, casually Play it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke set off the trading contract, just glanced at it, just sneered and wanted to say something, suddenly his face changed, then looked up and saw Richard The scroll in his hand was suddenly enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been paying attention to Link’s reaction, knowing that he must have seen the Kamarila scroll on the list, faintly said: “Look first Finish, think clearly, talk again, otherwise I am upset, maybe I will change my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke bowed his head, the color of the haze flashed, then Convergence, as a magician, of course he knows the Kamarila scroll, and can also guess the use of this scroll in the ransom. He snorted, but did not speak, but looked down and read it again. Oh, when there is hope in life, there is always an instinct to survive, knowing to bow properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Linke quietly and found that although he was a little surprised by the contents of the list, he immediately recovered to the point of course, and could not help but move his mind. Suddenly remembered, Qi Qi once mentioned that Link is a great magician of the spiritual specialization, and the spirit of the specialization has a common characteristic: a firm will, in some cases, extremely stubborn, this In detail, a small weight was added to the balance in Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Link put the contract and list aside, looked up at Richard, and sneered and said: "The thing in your hand is ready for me. , what are you waiting for, I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger took a sigh of relief and his face was bright. Link was preparing to bow in disguise. He knew that the casting process of the Kamarila scroll was similar to signing the soul contract, which means that the two sides would temporarily enter a kind of Lord on the soul level. From the form of relationship, it is also a shame to a certain extent, and in this process, Richard, who is the main party, can peek at Link's memory at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard took over the contract, but it was torn apart and said: "But I disagree."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, almost everyone was stunned, only the faceless seems to have been expected, shrugged, and then yawned a big yawn, a boring look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, the messenger suddenly jumped up and pointed at Richard and screamed: "You...you didn't agree?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did I agree?" said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know clearly that as long as the Duke adults send all the ransom before dawn, the transaction will be established." The messenger screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "I suddenly changed my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, How can you do this." The messenger was shocked and angry, and at a moment he was overwhelmed and wanted to roar, but he saw that Richard had no smiling eyes, but he was as if he had been poured a basin of ice water and was in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored the messenger, but turned back to Qi Qi: "I remember telling you that day, since he wants to force you, it is damn enough." "This sentence, I have not forgotten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 long eyelashes trembled, bowed his head, softly but firmly said: "Master, this But the ransom of more than one top sacrifice, my grievances are nothing at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiles, Qi Qi deliberately calls his master, is in Euphemistically reminding him of his status as a family leader, but perhaps other giants will be willing to use interest to calm down, but at least now, when it comes to the core personnel of Qi Qi, Richard will not accept the transaction. He will let those who are skeptical see the anger of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very sensible. In my eyes, the dignity of my future big builders can be exchanged without a top sacrifice, and not much." After that, Richard’s cold eyes swept over the messenger and said, “Go back and tell the Duke of Myron that these ransoms are temporarily placed in me and they are treated as deposits. I will return them to him after the execution of tomorrow.” ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger apparently has not reacted from the tremendous changes in the moment, eating the authentic: "Bet... deposit, this ... but ... placed on you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He said faintly: "On this point, you can't buy the credit of Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger would not dare to say more, such as Flying away, Link was angered and stunned, and finally sighed and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t say much about Li, and turned to the dungeon. Qi Qi went to the study with Richard, but she stayed in the square. Take a deep look at the pile of boxes that symbolize wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Li, who began to study the structure again, heard the footsteps of Qi Qi and said, "Let’s come over and see The design of this deep red fire is very interesting, especially here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t finished talking yet, and Qi Qi suddenly hugged him from behind. The body suddenly softened like a snake, flexibly plunged into Richard's arms, kissed his mouth, and blocked his words back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, neither of the two architects could focus on the construction, even if it was a deep red fire that once produced a magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is coming soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the floating world became noisy, and people flocked to the main hall of execution in the morning, occupying a place where there was not much, but this kind of excitement It’s rare, especially if it’s a constructor, many people are looking forward to the Duke’s confrontation with the floating island giants, especially those small aristocrats at the bottom, who can’t wait to kill each other’s blood on the spot. That is fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost nine o'clock, and a team of knights walked out of the hall of the transfer, like a long dragon, going to the temple of public punishment, the knight’s The team did not see the end. Because of the size, the ogre lords did not have a team, but the discerning people still found several people of different shapes in this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some whispers whispered quietly: "The few people look a little special."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it a follower of Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Richard is determined to win this time. He must first deal with the knights and followers in order to grab people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha himself is the most It’s hard to deal with.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it, he is not a builder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's check his record in the absolute battlefield..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the whispers, there are still some people whose eyes are all in vain, they Not only did he see the followers, but he also saw the construction of the knight. From some subtleties, these people have already seen that the composition of the knights and Richards have been different in front of everyone in the fauna, even though they are wearing uniform armor. Even the magic rides are exactly the same, but different people always have different subtle habits. In the eyes of well-trained people, it is natural to see the most obvious difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This batch of knights are all new, and this idea first appeared, immediately made them all shocked, and many thoughts were quietly The ground is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Richard said, building a knight, if the number is too high, it is everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are stunned, and some of them suddenly understand that this is what Richard wants them to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the two hundred knights, different people saw different things, and the road from the hall to the temple was very long, Richard believed that those It is enough that someone in need can see the information they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the punishment is not big, even some low and gloomy, and the other natural buildings of the miracle capital are very different. When people first discovered the vagrant, Naturally, this is used as a place for execution. Together with the gods of the Alliance Prison, it is the only two gloomy buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of Divine Relief is already crowded with people, and the vacant central area can’t squeeze all the knights, and Richard’s hand waved and let all the structures The knights were left outside, and only a few people entered the hall. Li Chau walked to the trial seat and sat down on the only high-back chair. He looked down at the entire execution ground and sat on the high position. Li It is natural to hold the lower jaw and put the elbow on his own leg. This is a somewhat unruly and arrogant posture. Now Richard is very natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
