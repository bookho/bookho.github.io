			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the final direction of the war, he is now difficult to grasp The only thing he can control is the battlefield. The forces outside the battlefield are entangled and confrontation is the biggest variable. There are too many factors involved in a war. It is not that second-order wisdom can completely cover statistics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard often thinks of a sentence that Su Helun and he said in the dark blue. "Many times, the strain is more important than the plan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers returning to the temporary camp are orderly returning to each other, and the injured will go to the two fallen pastors for treatment. Although the young Sissuo only followed the flow of sand for less than half a month, now it is already a second-level priest, and can be treated for minor injuries. It belongs to the kind of person who can not be considered, but can not be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to the center of the temporary camp, Shen Sheng said: "Now all rest, start tomorrow morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just resting in a camp 10 kilometers away, Richard’s guts can even be called arrogance. However, as he expected, Viscount Heim did not have the mood to pursue the enemy at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the strict warnings have not been able to prevent night attacks, it is not a good idea to pursue the night, especially during the day, the rugged mountains I was deeply impressed by the Viscount, and if I didn't have a guide familiar with the terrain, I probably didn't see the shadow of the enemy. I was first smashed by the slopes of the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the night has brought a small shadow to the Viscount of Heim, he will never bring in the soldiers, and he is worried that after the pursuit of the soldiers, the emptiness The camp will give Richard an abominable opportunity to truly threaten him. Heim does not believe that Richard dared to kill himself, and even dared not to make a disability. But if this daring development of the Cavaliers does something else, for example, let some girls go to him, borrowing something like blood and flesh, it is very likely, then he will lose money. This kind of thing is not without precedent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he thought about it, if Richard sent the girl with the amber eyebrows, then he would eat a little better. Then, Him then went to worry, then what should I do? If you really have your own blood in the damn pioneering pedigree, it is an insult to the noble unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Viscount is still immersed in the state of panic and anger, and all kinds of strange thoughts are jumping and jumping, a little sleepy. nor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked around in the camp, and he saw the ones he saw, the ones he saw, and even the ones he remembered. From time to time, he was ready to go on an upright confrontation with the group of countrymen under Richard's castle, so that he could see the style of the kingdom knight and give him a teaching battle for the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the Viscount seems to have forgotten, because of his strong interference, Baron Fontaine has completely fallen to his side, so Richard’s castle now has a foundation pit Have not finished dug. In addition, even if he did not interfere, the time of just half a month was only enough to make a foundation. This also took into account the role of Richard, the great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the viscounts are all his old subordinates, and have a deep understanding of the visceral temper. The general also only apparently made various timely statements with the joy and sorrow of the Viscount, but he did not pay attention to it at all. He knew that as long as he dragged through these hours, the Viscount would return to normal and the army would be restored tomorrow. The command was returned to him. Of course, the general direction still needs the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
