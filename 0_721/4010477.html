			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes are flickering, holding the necklace in his hand At some point, Richard suddenly activated the necklace, a beam of light quietly shot, instantly penetrated the back of the Heavenly Warrior, and shot through the core of the gods, time seems to be still at this moment, until the beam disappears It only re-flows, but in the sight of Richard, you can also see the void left by the beam through everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heavenly Warrior made a very angry snoring, and so did the gods. They were also hit hard. The most terrifying thing is that this light beam has no attribute at all, it is pure energy. Bombardment, so the part that was shot through it disappeared from the world forever. Before they reacted, Richard once again inspired the necklace, and the second beam was shot in an instant, once again silently piercing the Heavenly Warrior and God's core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously hit by two guns of Kenuweis, even if the legendary Heavenly Warrior is impossible to survive, he snorted very unwillingly. The giant sword pointed to Richard, but the holy fire on the sword was extinguished. He suddenly fell awkwardly, fell to the ground, rolled all the way from the gods, and the gods slowly softened, and the black infants in the air were connected. A drop without warning, the body of the gods whining, wanting to move to the door of the temple of pain, in order to escape, but it only moved a few meters, just like being nailed in the same place, no matter how hard, just put The body is getting longer and longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air finally appeared in the air, but the image was very vague, she did not enter the painful hall, but continued to stay between the half-plane and the real world, Under her, there is a vaguely visible image of the half-plane, which is already a barren ruin. The only thing that is striking is the huge stone pillars that are severely weathered, as Richard saw in the Temple of Eternal Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-face is full of light golden light, and there are countless bands of light flying from behind the sand, constantly adding penetration to the entire half. The power of time, the half-plane is everything still, but the gods struggled, the half-plane will vibrate accordingly, but it was quickly suppressed by the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time anchoring, sand flow uses the force of time to lock the semi-position in a fixed state, as long as the power of her time is not consumed, then the pain in the hall The gods don't want to escape. In essence, the gods and the lurking splits in the half-plane are actually one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai's hands began to float gray, trying to capture the body of the god hidden in the mountain, while Richard once again clenched the elf knife and continued to search for the core of the gods that had been hit hard. The blade began to bloom blue. The color of Moonlight, the gun of Kenuwes has the characteristics of instant arrival, the goal is inevitable, and the destruction of the use of Richards requires a process that needs to capture opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god finally felt the fear of destruction. It suddenly raised the voice, cursed everything it knew, and then burst it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion was so intense that the four people of Richard were smashed into the walls of the painful temple, and they almost fainted. The half-position of the sand-sand anchored bursts and trembles, and finally breaks away from her time-locked state. The flowing sand slams and the mouth bleeds and falls into the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small storm in the hall of pain, full of black infants, carrion, stinky juice, and other disgusting things that couldn’t be said. In the chaos, the two crying walls quietly opened a line, and a black sly figure rushed out of the temple door. When it came out of the hall, it immediately rolled out white smoke. After a scream, it suddenly accelerated. In an instant, it has disappeared into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops." Richard was shocked and the core of the gods had escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is already the case, and repentance is useless. Richard suddenly saw a white wing on the ground, and immediately swooped down and grabbed the wing and lifted it up. He pulled it hard, but his hand was light. The original mention of the hand was only the corner of the wing of the Heavenly Warrior. The body of the warrior was already assimilated by the body fluid of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that Heaven’s creatures are strong in the use of all kinds of energy, especially the divine power, and their ** is not outstanding, so this result is accepted. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core is lost, the body left by the gods begins to melt, and the ground is thick and thick, seemingly disgusting, Richard The people said hello and said, "Let's leave this first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the painful hall, all five have a sense of body and mind, even if it is The environment of Black Valley, at this moment, also surpassed the famous mountain Xiushui in the eyes. Richard immediately asked the other four people to fight in the semi-planet. The half-planes were similar, with dark creatures in them, each half-plane There is a separation of gods, the battle god officer is the easiest to deal with, his strong divine power can be used to kill the fragile dark creatures, and it is not too difficult to deal with the separation of gods, and the dark creatures that deal with no souls are not It's as easy as Iowa, but she is better at cleaning up the gods, which have no fixed form of life, so they go straight to the castle, hold the gods apart, and then the nature of the attack, actually smashed a meal God, sand is the direct use of time The castle was ruined, and then it was studying how to capture the gods, and finally locked the gods in a time-locked way, so that it could not escape. The most difficult thing was the water flower. After the girl rushed into the castle, she could kill everything that could be killed. They were all cut clean, and they were able to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods ran away, it doesn't matter." Richard asked the sand, and in this field, the gods are clearly authoritative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, it will not last long in this plane unless you can find something special like a painful temple if it escapes to the edge of the crystal wall Go, it has nothing to do with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Run and run, anyway, it doesn't matter." Richard nodded and put down a piece. Mind, there is no core, the remaining body of the god is a pile of worthless rotten meat, even the mother's nest is not interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a glance at Black Valley, Richard frowned: "I didn’t expect that the inner land of God’s punishment was actually feeding the gods, I really don’t understand him. What are you thinking about, is it crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel said: "Look well, maybe you can find something, I have to look like this land. There are still some hidden things. It is not easy to build a painful temple of this scale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been aware of what is deep in the ground, Then I contacted the mother's nest again. After a while, the turbulent land suddenly boiled. Thousands of worker bees vacated and flew to the black valley. Three other brains with more than 100 different kinds of feather snakes also Coming at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the serious injury, the disturbance to the starburst in the thick cloud finally disappeared, and the huge body of the star quietly emerged from the clouds and hovered in the black valley. Over the sky, dozens of squadron knights jumped from the ten-meter air and gathered in front of Richard. They immediately received an order, and the number of riders was quickly dispersed, and all the living regulators and law enforcers in the black valley were cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first wave of strike power. If there is such a presence in the Black Valley, then there will be two hundred special deals against the strong in a few hours. The lightning feather snake arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many law enforcement officers in Black Valley, and most of the monitors have lost control, wandering aimlessly, and then being cut down by the squadron knight. The Cavaliers did not encounter much resistance. In the Black Valley, a god is the ultimate force. Beside it, few other creatures can survive for a long time, but most of the prisoners in the Black Valley have stopped all movements and stood still. Land, indifferent to everything that happens around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, the brain and the lightning feather snake arrived in the black valley. With this force, Richard finally can no longer worry, so he began to thoroughly search for the black valley. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
