I don't value those."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie stun suddenly smiled: "I value, then you don't want to grab me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Nai’s so beautiful and mysterious smile, the fighting sergeant showed a creepy look and said: “You...you are laughing again.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What counts as a smile, I can do more for the sake of sacrifice." Nai Yu said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the official's eyebrows wrinkled, the first time I felt the situation was grim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s sentence, there is indeed a sentence saying that for Yu Fansheng, faith is the flame of warm soul, indispensable, There is faith, but not blindly, this is the full meaning of these two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development direction of the gods in this plane is basically a mad believer, where the sword of the god points, where they will rush, and the faith in Noland After the advent of the times, the composition of believers has changed with the cross-plane gods headed by the dragon of eternal and timeless. In the era of great faith, the most famous saying is St. Martin’s saying: “When God The sword points to the devil, which is my master, and when the sword of God points to my family, it is no longer a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is a no return, Once it is shaken, it is very difficult to turn back. Richard is actually persuading them to give up all their beliefs and concentrate on studying the order of the gods from a completely neutral perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard and the group of sinners reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Ptolemy and others have long since given up their faith in the god of courage. They are only temporarily unable to accept the disorder and stand on top of the gods. Roles, this is beyond the imagination, it takes time to adapt, and Richard is very much looking forward to them, regardless of Ptolemy, Bruno, or other old people, they have been the tallest characters in the whole preface, far in the life Above, those who can touch the glory of the kingdom of God, they can still live, they can prove the strength of the past, they used to be the most knowledgeable person in life, so studying the law of the Faro, perhaps the most appropriate one Batch of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard walked out of the wooden house and greeted the people gathered inside and outside the house: "Make more clothes! The road is still very long, and the weather outside is not as gentle as here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we go." Ptolemy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I have prepared special rides for you. They are not comfortable enough, maybe they are uncomfortable, but they can be fast enough. You are sent to your destination. This is not the place we can stay for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of Richard, hundreds of worker bees flew over and climbed up. In front of a group of survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really...not very comfortable." Ptolemy said, then he took the lead to climb the back of a worker bee, the two originals The tentacles that came to identify the direction were rolled back, wrapped around Ptolemy, and fixed him. Then the worker bee flew up and led seven or eight worker bees to fly into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I change the way." An old man asked, and then his waist was entangled in the tentacles, and then the worker bees hugged the sky with the limbs. He shouted and shouted: "No, still use the method just now, let me down, you are a bug,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screaming all the way Going, the group of worker bees immediately flew up, planted the survivors of the Black Valley, and flew to the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at them, Richard said to the sand and other people: "Let's go to the painful hall to see it. It seems to have found some good underneath." Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful hall at the moment is one-third less. The upper part is covered with worker bees and the black bricks are removed. When you accumulate a few pieces, you will bite them and fly to the stars that float in the air. Put the black bricks into the belly of the star, and more black bricks can't fit. They can only be temporarily piled on the ground, crying the wall. It has collapsed, and the floating faces on the door are writhing, trying to escape from the two stone walls that are holding them, but no soul can escape, even if the wall of crying has been broken, they are still sleepy. In it, no relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crying on the wall, Naiyou directly stepped on those faces, her boots seem to have magical power, and there will be a series of ripples in the place where they fall. The ripples, all the faces in the range will appear more painful, they will go to bite the person next to them, and even painfully twist their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard's gaze, Nyin explained: "They all think that they are souls, but they are not. They are all part of the gods, and they are the playthings for fun."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Nei is an expert, so Richard did not speak, but continued to go to the hall of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of worker bees flowed from their side, and when they climbed out of the temple, the worker bees were carrying mud or stones, when Richard stood at the door. Inside, the front is a crater of several tens of meters deep. The excavation of the worker bees has dug all the underside of the hall, revealing a deep underground pool. The water in the pool is dark black. In the pool, there is a huge sacrum floating in the pool. It is like the lower body of a certain behemoth. It is a hill-like skeleton. Although it is only half a section, it is also nearly 100 meters long. There are complex and dense lines on the bones, just like beautiful decorations. An indescribable force is continuously scattered from the sacrum, and then absorbed into the black pool. Finally, it turns into a black gas, penetrates into the earth, and now it is painful. The bottom of the bed is already filled with light black fog, which is what Richard feels in the black valley land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skeleton, this black pool is the source of the black valley and the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Although Richard has a broad knowledge, he has not yet reached the level of omniscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wasting a little bit of grace." Flowing sand step forward, taking out the book of time, aiming at the skeleton of the black pool at the bottom of the pit, several pale gold The light shines on it, and the power of time flows down like water. The graphics and words on the book of Time are very slow, but the surface of the sand is slightly lustrous. The more the gods consumed, the more The value of things is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a god in the book of Time, and there is a simple and simple brushstroke. This painting is a few pens, but it is very vivid and fierce. The gas is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted his head and said: "This is the remains of the star beast. It should be one of the three star beasts that invaded the Faro plane. Called the source of **, the function is to absorb the power of the star beast and transform it into the power of darkness and pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Source of **, etc. I seem to have heard of this thing." Richard thought for a while, then said: "If it is long enough, most of the time there will be painful essence, the value of this thing is not under the spider's abalone. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First try to get the bones out, otherwise the second god will appear sooner or later in the black valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, an order in consciousness Going out, a large number of worker bees fly to the source of the **. When they come into contact with the black water, the worker bees immediately emit white smoke. They make a sharp tweet, not because of pain, but because of danger, but worker bees are That is, they are not afraid of pain, nor are they afraid of death. Their only consciousness is to try to complete the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of worker bees swarmed into the source of the **, and then the huge shin bone began to move, slowly being lifted from the black water, as soon as it left the water, More worker bees rushed up, grabbed the cheekbones, and began to flutter, so the cheekbone slowly lifted off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star squats down the ground from the air. It first spits out all the black bricks in the abdomen, then hangs down the tentacles and wraps around the half bones of the star beasts, struggling to lift this With a bone that is bigger than itself, it slowly rises to the sky. The star is slow, but it can always rise to a height of several kilometers. At this height, it is almost unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard was somewhat uneasy and sent two hundred feather snake escorts, including one hundred lightning feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star scorpion and the escort feather snake slowly fell into the clouds, and Richard was relieved that the value of this skeleton was enormous, and it could extract energy from the void. And it’s spurt out. This alone is enough to make people crazy. If you have it, you will have a source of magic that never dies at all times. The combination of it and the pool of ** makes it so vast. The Black Valley even supported the growth of a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee has even begun to envisage the future use of this sacral method, which can always be combined with the worm nest to supply energy to the worm nest forever. Increase the number of combat units that the hen's nest can make on a daily basis; it can also be used for parental parsing, thus opening the door to the nest to resolve the legendary behemoth, but how much resolution can be reached, it is two, Li You can also learn the lines and magical flow on the cheekbones. It is a natural magical magical array. The effect is much stronger than that of Richard's Stars. Even Richard can go further and try to resolve the humerus. The power of the rules seems to be more than a few hundred thousand days of analysis time, and it is possible to master a new rule. From the mastery of the rules, Richard’s wisdom and real talent are extremely powerful. Of course, strong is a prerequisite. That is the current level of Richard, and it may take hundreds or even tens of millions of years to master a large number of rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
