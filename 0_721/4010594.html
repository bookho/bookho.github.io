			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the soldiers have not completely dealt with the wood crows that fell on the ground, they have to turn around and deal with more dangerous wood ants, they are trained The warrior, but also two or three knives to hack a wood ant, the thick carapace of the wood ants is their natural armor, but the wood ants are only Warcraft, and these soldiers are considered to be elite in the entire Holy Alliance. The division, the army and the herd are completely different. Immediately, the officers ordered the soldiers to change their arm shields. They directly patted the wood ants, and the small snails of the net ants, and the follow-up soldiers followed up and strangled, eating wood. The tide of the ants was immediately stopped by the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bird-eater spiders jumped from the tree of life and rushed to the wood ants that constantly rushed out of the forest. The two sides immediately launched a desperate fight, massive Bird-eater spiders are the main force against wood ants, but unlike wood ants, there are rules in the attack and defense between bird-eaters. There are more than a dozen bird-eater spiders that are twice as big as their peers. They can directly come from Richard. Accepting orders, and then commanding the own bird's bird attack or defense, although only simple scheduling, but the war is more efficient than the wood ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slap in the face, there are a lot of dead ants on the ground, about a dozen wood ants will die, and there will be a food. The bird spider died in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing on the tree of life, looking at the whole picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of wood ants is large, but Richard has a glance, and roughly guessed, the number should be about 50,000, which is not a small number. Because, there are so many wood ants that appear in other life trees, but this tree of life is a tributary to Richard, the deadly enemy of the world tree. From the performance of the world tree at the time of the last promotion The number of wood ants that are not directly turned into three or four times is considered polite, and how it might give normal treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has doubts in his heart and begins to think about it. It’s not very important that the situation at this moment is very serious. The number of natural enemies coming to attack is much less than normal, and Li The power of the arrangement is based on the expectation of ten natural enemies. It is the words of the wood ants in front of them that the bird-eaters can eat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is shaking again. You can see a ridge on the ground, and it is flying toward the tree of life. This is the sign of the crypt spider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few meters below the ground, hundreds of crypt spiders are advancing rapidly, almost as fast as the running horses. The soil layer melts in front of them and returns to the original shape. This is the talent of the crypt spiders, their sense of smell. Extremely sharp, the taste of the roots of life is as strong as the torch in the night, which is not delicious for them, but the foremost crypt is less than a hundred meters away from the roots of life. The soil next to it suddenly broke open, and a worker bee rushed out of the soil. They were deeply inserted into the body of the crypt spider with a pair of blades, and the giant python bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crypt spider screams, and it has a total of seven or eight fortified worker bees hanging on it, and it is bitten in the blink of an eye, though It also shredded two worker bees, but in the end it was torn into pieces by more worker bees. The large number of worker bees constantly poured out. On average, four or five were used to deal with a crypt spider. The single battle of the worker bees was not a crypt spider. The opponents are often bitten into two in one bite, but the worker bees are extremely tenacious. They will not die if they don’t break their heads, and their half-meter-long fortified giants are extremely powerful. In the crypt spider's body, a deep hole is created. The crypt spider attacks a worker bee, and no other worker bees are taken. Each time a worker bee sacrifices his attention to attract the attention of the crypt spider, so that other worker bees can find the attack opportunity. Although the crypt spider has a huge body of nearly two meters, it can't really afford the worker bees to feed for a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worker bees are connected with the ancestral avatar consciousness, and Richard can also grasp the underground battle situation through the avatar. The crypt spider has about two hundred heads, which is also a The number of 'normal', the two thousand worker bees prepared by the mother nest were prepared to die, and the remaining crypt spiders would be killed by the sanctuary who guarded the tree of life, but now less than five The bee worker will kill all the crypt spiders, and the life tree will not need to shrink the roots. After all, shrinking the roots is almost the same as the migration, and the tree of life will be greatly hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only accident is the emergence of the reincarnation tribe, but only two, only a few hundred beasts with a beast, this group of animals is simply not enough Fear, they didn't even rush to the warriors. The surviving thousands of bird-eater spiders went up and killed in the blink of an eye. As for the two people who drove the beasts, the water and the ochre greeted them. They are good at rapid movement and sudden killing. They have no room to play in front of the two killing gods, and one face is killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the battle is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the tree of life, very stunned, but he couldn’t believe that the battle ended like this. Not only Richard, but many strong people looked like one. In the fog, Senma and Asiris exchanged their eyes, and Nyris and Agamemnon whispered, they were all guessing, this is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you know this battle, the momentum that Richard made is absolutely not small. The fighting power is almost out of the nest. There is no reservation. Even the mother-in-law arms are exposed to Nyris and Agamemnon. The bird spider is a short-lived consumable unit that directly made 10,000. It can be imagined how much resources are consumed, but the result is that both the bird-eater and the worker bee survive most of the time. The elf shooters are still busy and shoot a lot of arrows. The soldiers under the tree were very light, just blocking the wood ants, and then there was nothing for them. As for the sanctuary, the great Druids and the great priests did not get the shots. Opportunity, if it weren’t for the last two guys who drove the beasts, the splashes and the ochre had no chance to move their bones and muscles. In the battle, they were all hitting the enemy. In fact, they had a little bit of activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha always felt that it should not be so simple, so he waited quietly, and others saw that Richard was like this, based on his confidence in him, he felt that he might still There will be enemies coming and waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour passed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris finally got together with Richard, who was always standing still and looking far away, and asked, "Is it finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should..." Richard is not very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, you can’t wait for nothing to do, and the eyes of the strong have become hot, and Richard finally ordered the troops. Rest, and some of the surviving bird-eaters were scattered all over, in order to find the enemy at the first time, but Richard felt at this moment that there would be no more enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee let the soldiers clean up the battlefield, dug a big pit, throw all the bodies of the natural enemies of the life tree into it, and then bury them, the worker bees are A passage was opened underground, and these bodies were quietly transported to the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong have their own rest, and Richard still leans on the tree of life to meditate. After a moment he communicates the will of the tree of life, even though he is promoted. Important node, the tree of life is still not afraid of wasting soul power, consuming a lot of energy to praise Richard's great achievements until it is interrupted by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for a while, knowing that the natural enemies of this attack are indeed of normal size. For a guardian elf tribe, the natural enemies of this rule are still It is possible to block it, but it requires a major sacrifice. It may not be able to recover for decades. A strong tribe such as the Yongye tribe will sacrifice, but it should be able to recover within ten years. As for the third-level tribe For example, if the thorn leaves are not supported by other tribes or the world tree, it is possible to destroy the clan in a wave of attacks, and the military forces gathered at this moment can completely defeat the proverbs of the proverbs and the alliance tribes. Dealing with a few natural enemies is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
