			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the knights and swordsmen were scared and afraid, some did not know Some of them are taking out swords and screaming at Senma. They are usually used to arrogance. They haven’t turned their brains for a while, and they don’t dare to rush to fight, but they can’t be heard if they come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And dare to block." Semma still smiled charmingly, but her eyes flashed murderously, she hunted her lips hungrily, riding a gun A wave, shouted: "Take me step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 12 elite knights behind Senma, heard the words, a punch The sergeant's formation was smashed and split, and then the central part of the swordsmen was crushed like a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of heavy-loaded knights and rides on the rush, where are the light armor swordsmen, the knights did not even shoot, no swords, By stepping on the magic riding, the whole swordsman was stepped on a mess, and most of the dead and wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the swordsman battalion were so scared that they were stunned. They looked at the situation and fled to both sides. The escape speed was even worse than that of Richard. The elite knight is fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leader of the swordsman battalion that was taken by Senma was hard to get up from the ground, he saw that most of his arrogant men were laid down. He was on the spot and even forgot the pain on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful slap in the face, and then stepped on the horse, Senma’s mood seems to have become much better, smiled: "How many of you What are you still standing here, don't roll fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several of Brahms's knights have come to realize, and now they turn around and run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Senma slammed and immediately let the knights nail in place, dare not move again, she sneered and said: "Clean the way Going again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to resist this female devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the swordsman battalion is still able to stand the injured and the body to the side, the three juniors with the army also released the water system Magic, cleaned the road contaminated by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of death, the people who can still act in these swordsmen battalions suddenly expressed the energy beyond imagination, and one person did the work of seven or eight people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came to the checkpoint at a constant speed, the road was already very clean, and only a few blood spots witnessed the battle that had just taken place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said to Senma: "Good job, go, our time is tight."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness." Senma softly agreed, and Zema followed up with Richard, listening to her voice, completely imagining how much bloody the Paladin of Blood caused in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund’s tens of thousands of troops immediately rolled into the Brahms collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there was another muffled sound in the Dragon Wing Castle, and the Marquis’ new desk was shattered again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn Richard, what he used to be, what the sacred dynasty became, which made me how I would be a man in the future." Roaring echoed throughout the Dragon Wing Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the combat room, no one dares to pick up the Marquis at this time, even the persuasion and appease are not dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crazed cursing for ten minutes, Brahms stopped to slow down, he gasped for a while, asked: "That Richard, which The direction went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military monk hesitated for a moment before he said: "He walked along the autumn road and went directly to the direction of the city. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the name, everyone in the combat room was moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Wing Castle is the residence of the Marquis. It has excellent scenery, and it is easy to defend and difficult to attack. It is stationed in the army. This station has a deeper role. It is the great aristocrats who guard against the north of the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases, the greatest enemy of the lords is actually the other lords of the same empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sundial City is the largest and most prosperous city in the Marquis. More importantly, four of the seven private planes of the Brahms family are built in the Sundial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is a legendary mage, one of his numerous teachers, Su Hailun’s numerous titles is the space master, such a magician, don’t say let him get the plane channel It is a long time to look at a moment, it is possible to calculate the coordinates of those planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the Dragon Wing Castle or the Sundial City, there is no place to be lost in the Marquis. Now Richards flies directly to the Sundial City, no matter what, Bo Rams can't ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gloomy middle-aged general stepped forward and said, "Adult, this is war, we have 200,000 troops, and there is that Adult support, why bother with this Richard, let me Keller try to see if these damn Archimonde is really crazy, really dare to fight with our Brahms, dare and the whole holy The tree dynasty went to war. In front of me Keller, even if Richard is a legendary mage, the combat power is not strong enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Brahms looks forward This man’s first battle, at the same time, his strength reached the confidant of the heavenly sanctuary. He shot his shoulder heavily and said, “Well, I will give you 70,000 people, as long as they can let the damn Richard pay. At the cost, you can do whatever you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celestial sanctuary showed a sneer and said, "The adults are relieved, although I heard that Richard is very capable. Fighting, but he only brought 50,000 people. Even if he beat me, his strength will be greatly damaged. When he wants to leave the holy tree dynasty, he will not be so It’s easy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, his smile suddenly smashed a few points and asked: "Adult, if I win the first time, you How to deal with this investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms seriously thought about it and said: "You must teach him a meal, but killing is even His teacher is Su Hailun, the woman is very troublesome, that is, my uncle is not willing to provoke her easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller looked disappointed and said: "It’s really cheap for this little rabbit." As a heavenly sanctuary, Kevin felt that he had at least the power of self-protection, and his special ability had a repressive advantage in front of the Master. It was not long before Richard entered the legend. The strength can be strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after entering the Marquis of Brahms, Richard saw Keller, the heavenly sanctuary, and the 70,000 army behind him. This number is 20,000 more than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller Zema forward, shouting loudly: "Licha, here is the holy tree dynasty, not the place where you can scatter the wilderness, now leave immediately Our territory still has time, I have not happened this thing, otherwise,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will happen." Richard asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha really feels very interesting, this heavenly sanctuary is too close to him, even dare to be within 100 meters, even the general battle For the legal profession, this distance is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat style of Richard has always been a hit and kill, to Richard’s current strength, that is, the ordinary legend is afraid that he will not escape his full force, the district A heavenly sanctuary, killing is also a matter of a few knives, not to mention that he now absorbs the heart of the demon lord who is suspected of Archimonde's ancestor, and the whole body is full of inhuman power, and the final shortcoming is also Make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eye-catching look is very uncomfortable for Keller’s. He subconsciously thought, what is this look, Keller remembers that he’s not watching before. When I went to the idiot of the sanctuary, it seemed to be the kind of vision used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller snorted and forced his anger, and said coldly: "What will happen, it will be war."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War." Richard smiled and waved his hand and said, "Senma, try his skills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me again" The blood paladin is very reluctant to answer, and then demon to Keller, but she is not born to play the style of the wind, it looks quite raw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keller snorted, took off the giant warhammer, and jumped from the war, and the momentum was like a mountain, and went to Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the battlefield, the storm started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma illusion into countless red bands, surrounded by Keller, the sword in the hand as a squally shower, and Keller is in a state of calm, Every blow of the warhammer will bring a large yellow halo, his powerful power is great, and the murderous Sensen, Senma simply does not dare to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
