			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the sand has gradually revealed exhaustion, and Nye and Io The face changed slightly, and they saw that in a short period of time, the sand has consumed the equivalent of a high-level sacrifice, but not only the metal ball did not respond, but there was no trace left on the page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we found a bigger problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pupils shrink, he has never seen such expressions in the sand, so he asks: "Greater troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still can't confirm it, I have to bring it back to the eternal dragon temple in Nolande to be authenticated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard frowned and asked: "What is this, even the name does not know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 流沙说: "The end of the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange noun. Richard has never heard of it anywhere, but it is not a good thing to just sound from the meaning of the name, and since the sand can be said It shows that it used to exist before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the end of the mark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a title, can be anything I am only guessing. The characteristic of the Doomsday Seal is that it cannot be resolved and captured by the power of time. No matter how much God I consume, it will not respond. This actually means that it is the glory of the Eternal and Time Dragon. One thing outside, when I have time, tell you in detail, it doesn't matter now, we should have enough time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodding, the mood is inexplicably heavy and oppressive. He asked: "What should I do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Said profoundly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Richard no longer hesitated and began to issue a series of orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu first appeared outside the temple door, and the ogre governor screamed to start climbing. After a while, he climbed the top of the temple and began to dismantle the stone at the top of the temple. Nearly a thousand worker bees also flew to the top of the temple. Helping the ogre to dismantle together, their efficiency is extremely high, and in the twinkling of an eye, a huge skylight is opened between the temple roof, and then the huge body of the star appears in the air and slowly descends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many soldiers in the army of Licha were the first to see the stars and the worker bees, so the end of the scene suddenly made them completely lose their voice and more fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars hang down countless tentacles, tightly wrapped around the statue of the Highland God of War, and began to rise slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland God of War shook a few times, and he was about to be pulled up from the ground, but suddenly there was a loud scream in the hall, and the statue was shining. The whole body is like immersed in blood, then slammed down and fell back to the pedestal. This suddenly changed suddenly, and the star smashed quickly, and even the tentacles were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcibly inciting the image of the will of the Highland God of War, waiting for this moment, Richard, Liusha, Naiyou, Io almost simultaneously shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shot a little dark red flame and rushed to the statue. When the flame touched the statue, it immediately burned fiercely, and the dark flame contained a strong abyss. This is the power that can harm the will and the spirit. The sand is a swirling hourglass that stops at the top of the idol. When the light hourglass stops rotating, the light on the statue stops flowing, but other people’s The action is unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou still waved a gray mist, dipped in the idol, the condensed light then turned from red to gray, while Io The brilliance of the tide between the hands, the fierce impact on the light of the god of the high gods, he chose the direct magic to burn, this is the most direct, most fierce attack, no room left, who is the power of competition Affordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the priest's attack is gorgeous and fierce, and more importantly, his attitude is simply the loyal dog that the master will point to the big bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally let you find the opportunity." Nai quietly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel only did not hear anything, desperately pouring all his power, no reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, there was another roar of fear, anger and unwillingness. It was silent, and there was still a divine power in the image, but the spiritual light had disappeared. The consciousness of the high gods who had just descended into the gods was already in the fourth. The people are completely destroyed, and this is also a very heavy loss for a god who will fall from a weak power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in a very remote and remote corner of the void, a country of God quietly emerged, and God is full of angry roar everywhere: "How This is how it will happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the voice of God. In the Kingdom of God, this is supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So God’s domestic land is shaking, the mountains are cracking, and the river is on the shore, turning into a torrent of Hongtao’s enthusiasm, one by one Struggling in the flood, carrying the sun and floating, they still do not forget to pray and praise, and pray for God's forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In God, prayer is the only way to get rid of disasters. These people will not survive under normal circumstances, but it does not mean that they cannot be destroyed. They are soaked in the floods caused by anger for a long time, and they will die and return to the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has left his throne, stalking back and forth in the hall, and grabbing something from time to time, squatting on the ground, whether it is What, when it hits the ground, it will splash countless golden lightning, and lightning even spills over his temple, thus turning into a greater disaster in the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the temple, standing in rows of the Holy Spirit, there are more humans and dwarves, and the number of barbarians is less than one-third. When the lightning penetrated the temple, the Holy Spirit was also affected. They had no resistance at all, and they were instantly turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is omniscient in God's kingdom. The Highland God of War in the Temple naturally knows how many Holy Spirits are destroyed by his own anger. The Holy Spirit is in the War of the Kingdom. The main problem, the problem is that in the next crisis, a few more or a few Holy Spirits are less important, and the ending is the same, only the time is sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was particularly angry when he thought of it. In fact, he couldn’t tell whether he was angry or afraid. He could only scream continuously: "Why are you so arrogant?" , why, I want to lower the punishment, I want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, he suddenly stopped roaring, and all the anger disappeared instantly. At this time, he had recalled the scene at that time. After he noticed that his consciousness had come, Richard was the first to attack. The slightest hesitation, it is not a mortal attitude towards God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment before the conscious destruction, the high gods of war only saw endless light, and the surging power, which is the masterpiece of the fighting priest, but To be impressed, but still far less than sand, sand can actually make his consciousness stagnate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not sand, the height of the God of War is damaged, but it can still escape to the kingdom of God, but the sand can actually make his consciousness escape. The means she used, the god of war in the Highlands still can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be both a force in the field of time and space, but time and space are actually rules that transcend the plane of Faro, in the cognition of Faro It is a rule that belongs to the higher level of the crystal wall outside the Faro world. The so-called god of space, the god of time, is far from the real rule. How can this be the god of the high gods of the true God? Xerxes and Sinai definitely do not have this ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard, Richard even makes him tremble more than the sand, the flame that Richard ignites contains a strange ability, even seems to be burning to the high gods The body of the body makes him painful. How can a normal attack be so painful? It is not a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Nai's attack is the most inconspicuous, but it has quietly consumed a lot of his power, and finally Io destroyed his sorrow. A true God, the amount of consciousness that can separate the ontology is very limited, and the loss of each consciousness is permanent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland God of War is more calm, he forced himself to recall everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After occupying the Great Temple, the first thing Richard did was to count all the advanced oracles, except for the other treatments of the Pope. They all directly demanded to change their beliefs. Anyone who did not respond on the spot was directly executed and left no room left. This is the practice of not wanting to communicate with the God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the Highland God of War suddenly has a cold heart. Since the ignition of the fire, the Highland God of War has the second time to feel this way. Soon, he was pushed down from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
