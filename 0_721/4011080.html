			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of sculptures are three people walking in the wilderness, they all wrapped their bodies in robes, most of them are hidden in low hats, only Expose a little area below the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common pioneering scene. It is said that people who originally fell to the dark areas, including the eternal and timeless dragons, are so endless. Walk on the wasteland until one day you can find an area that is suitable for igniting the fire of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when the fire of time is ignited can the order light curtain be established, the distortion rules of this area can be dispelled, and then the city can be established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is the last refuge for those who fell to the dark areas. If there is no city, or if you can't find the city in time, even the super strong will slowly die on the wasteland. Richard has already experienced this in the field of dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of three people, seeing the costumes to know is the eternal and the dragon of the time of the gods. And this group of statues is really too expressive. Although Richard is standing at the gate of the city, although he sees the back, he immediately recognizes that it is sand, Nai and Io. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the back of Iowian, Li’s mind immediately floated the old man who was waiting for himself. So he understood that I was waiting for himself in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard’s face suddenly paled. Isn't the short memory gap after God's transmission actually spanned a full three thousand years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand years! If Noland is also over three thousand years, Richard does not know what the world will look like when he returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a stone monument standing beside the statue, with the simple words inscribed in the origin and meaning of this group of statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the statue is indeed the deities of the gods and her deeds of guardian Nei and Io. When the sand came to the dark area, the area was still chaotic, and even the light was very rare. Any strong who falls here will die slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand, Io, and Naiyou found the geographically distorted land after a long walk. That is the source of all the twisting rules and the base camp of the aborigines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can imagine the hardships of those battles. Even Richard, who killed the butchers, can only imagine one or two from the side. The butcher had already given Richard some headaches. He couldn't imagine the three people in the sands breaking into the twisted biobase camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, the war broke out. After breaking the twisted land, order and light are on the earth, and this vast area is separated from the darkness, and then there is a place of dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original place of dawn is even worse than the current dusk. The sand, Io, and Nei are constantly walking, breaking through a twisted nest everywhere. Little by little, the rules are transformed into order. The land of dawn has gradually become angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long process, and even the master who left the group of statues couldn’t tell how many years the gods used to clean up the distortion rules. . However, in this process, Naiyou did not persist until the end. In less than a thousand years, she fell into a fly ash and became part of the dawning land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou is behind, and the sand begins to build a time lighthouse. But she eventually failed to complete the time lighthouse and lost the news. The last thing that happened was Io, who was said to have been to the city three thousand years ago, and then disappeared. It should have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows the location of the Time Lighthouse, and no one knows where the sand is going. Until now, all the people in the entire dawn have stubbornly believed that the sand is still alive. The god who used to go to the millennium for thousands of years, no matter where it is now, she still lives in everyone's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen this experience, and looking at this group of statues, Richard’s feelings are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of statues has been around for 3,000 years. When it was formed, the order was not as solid as it is today. The master who carved the statues on the same day, the mastery of the twisting rules is almost perfect, not much worse than the current Richard, so that a group of such expressive statues can be left and can be preserved until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this group of statues, the city has become more and more prosperous for thousands of years, becoming what it is today and becoming The holy city of the entire dawning place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this city of dawn, the order has returned to a considerable extent. Looking around, the people on the streets are flowing, and there are all kinds of shops on both sides of the road. Doors and windows are installed on almost every building. If the twisting rules are strong, doors, windows and furniture are killing tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw a team of patrol soldiers who maintained order and walked through the street. This surprised him because it meant that there was law in the city of dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Richard walked around in the city of dawn, and naturally heard a lot of legends about sand drifting, for the development of the dark ages of the year. Gradually spell out a complete image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dark pioneering era, the original gods disappeared one by one, but the power of order remained. The balance between distortion and order was broken in the sand hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger the power of order, the easier it is for the strong who fall into the darkness to survive, and the easier it is to find a town or city with an orderly light curtain. . In the land of dawn, if the order power of the Holy City is so strong, anyone who falls within 10,000 kilometers will instinctively feel the call of the Holy City and find the right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dawn of the Holy City, there is already a law, which means no longer able to murder. There are not only lords in the Holy City, but also parliaments and elders, and even courts and prisons. Here is still the order of the strong, but the weak also have the right to live and the minimum dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is heaven compared to the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the person who can cross 100,000 kilometers and travel from the dusk to the dawning land is only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every corner of the dawn of the Holy City, every detail, Richard seems to have seen the figure of sand. Even if he has traveled across two areas, it is hard to imagine how she spent the first few thousand years. It is an indescribable loneliness, and it is also the most unbearable punishment of a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand does not eventually build a time lighthouse, but it is also normal. Which big domain, not a gods who have gone through several generations of the same title, went on and on, and this finally built the lighthouse of time? For example, in the field of dusk, the gods of the three generations of dusk have been degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of dawn is opened up in the hands of the sand, she is the owner of the first generation of dawn. Looking at the current situation of the dawning land, I am afraid that it will take a long time to return to the land of order. There is another generation of oracles who can ignite the beacon of time anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stay in the dawn of the holy city for the long time, the next day he changed to a sufficient number of square bluestone, and then quietly left here. There are too many shadows of sand in this city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not follow the prescribed route strictly, but found several twisted nodes on the way and eliminated them. Distorted nodes are areas where the torsion rules are exceptionally dominant, and there are often a large number of aborigines in the vicinity of the nodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near a twisted node, Richard even saw a place similar to a village. Only this village, like the aborigines, is in a state of semi-virtualization. That is to say, order creatures are hard to see or perceive them, but when they come into contact, they will find that they actually exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to eliminate twisted nodes, they are often besieged by nearby aborigines. So to eliminate the nodes, you must kill these aborigines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current dawn, the number of twisted nodes has been greatly reduced, and the existing nodes are also hidden. However, Richard's control of the twisting rules is close to perfect, and only by subtle changes in the surrounding rules can you find the twisted nodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you destroy a twisted node, it means that the dawning place has taken another step toward the order world. It will be easier for Richard to light the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eliminating the four twisted nodes, Richard found that his understanding of the twisting rules went one step further. He simply did not rush to advance toward the time lighthouse, but searched for twisted nodes in the direction of advancement and eliminated them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Richard unexpectedly discovered an extraordinarily strong twisted node. Within the scope of the twisted node, there are actually three aboriginal villages, and there are more than ten butchers here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a small half-day killing, Richard almost killed the aborigines here, leaving only one of the strongest butchers, and a skinny original Residents. The butcher is still very clear, the small inhabitants are translucent and the body is in a semi-virtual state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
