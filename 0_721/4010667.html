			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage adjusted his posture slightly, slightly moving, his mouth suddenly Open, a sigh of utter sigh, the body slowly settles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Richard also made a beast like a beast, a red tide on his face, desperately trying to get up and deep into the deepest part of the starry sky. However, he was pressed by Su Hailun, and he was full of ambitions and strengths, but he only had to bear the weight. Fortunately, this kind of tolerance is still unacceptable. It is not the kind of itching that can not move. All are shaking, it is really pain and joy that cannot be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with another beautiful and mysterious blue pattern emerged on the surface of the legendary Master, the entire hall was once again covered by a deep blue glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage has entered the state of ecstasy, just moving with his own mind and instinct, pursuing the most peak happiness, fortunately she still can’t remember Li If the inspection is broken, otherwise, even if Richard’s body is the immortal body of the legendary gold, it can be squeezed into gold bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of insatiable itching soon became a kind of torture, just like the old man facing the supreme food but could not shut his mouth, Richard One bite, the first attempt to stimulate the ability from the bear's first superintendent, wants to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abilities of the bear’s first warlord are well known, and its power has long been confirmed by countless ladies and ladies, and it is said that even the tyrannosaur can be flattened. God's general power, unfortunately, the so-called tyrannosaurus is just a kind of earth dragon. Common tyrannosaurus may not be as thick as a real dragon's hind legs, but even if it is a so-called dragon, it belongs to the goods that can only be crushed by the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard’s counterattack did not end, even without the attention of the legendary Master, Su Helun was still immersed in his own world, chasing the peak happiness he had never experienced. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the world is balanced, there is income, there is a response, there must be a response to the action, the spell can not be counter-attacked, the ability of the bear’s first overseer directly hits Steel plate, Richard certainly has to pay the price, he only feels a lot of bones in the body, can no longer endure, the essence of a burst of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the extreme joy, it must be an extreme emptiness, and Richard immediately felt a sense of deep sleep, just want to sleep, but the legendary Master still Looking for your own peak...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s move, Richard immediately screamed, and he had a heart to die in an instant, but he couldn’t move at all, and there was a possibility of asking for death. All he could do was patience and endure again. Repeatedly pressed again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fresh fruit, after repeated juice, the rest is just slag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time seems to be very long, but it is also very long, and it is too long to see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the legendary mage makes a cry like a cry, Richard has already I don't know how many times I was squeezed out. The unbeaten myth of the bear's first overseer was not only completely destroyed, but also overwhelmed by several rounds of boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myths are always relative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of Su Hailun who dares to challenge a plane god, what myths will be ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pain ends, the joy is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master has a soft, weak force on Richard’s chest, and Richard looks slightly at the side, watching the beautiful little sleepy The face, the heart touched slightly, he moved his finger and found that he could finally move now, so he lifted the heavy hand like lead and gently took care of Su Hailun’s blond hair. The legendary mage snorted and arched with his head. A comfortable place, the eyes have been completely closed, and in a blink of an eye, she screamed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and kissed her little nose, then moved down a moment and printed it on the legendary Master’s lips. Then, again, the legendary mage slept and responded, but Richard still wanted the third, so the legendary mage who felt sleep was disturbed, and one arm crossed and pressed Richard. The body, and turned him into a state of no movement, this is safe to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no choice but to smile, but his heart is filled with an unspeakable peace and warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he suddenly remembered something, but almost came out with a cold sweat. The key is how long Su Hailun has to sleep. The last time she slept, but she slept for more than a year. No matter how long she sleeps, she doesn't seem to change, and she doesn't worry about the normal physiological reaction of hunger, but Richard can't, Richard is now forced to move, not to mention one year, that is, three months. Starving him, the star of the star and the fog of life are not omnipotent, he still needs to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard smiled dumbly, left behind his fears, and fell asleep with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this time Su Hailun only woke up after half an hour, she directly played in the air, stretched her body, made a big yawn, then lifted The hand slammed a finger, and the two elves and the servant took her clothes. Su Hailun looked at Richard and told him: "Give him a suit too."<br /><br />&nbsp ;[############################################################################################################## /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun said, "Let's find someone to send a few sets of Master's gowns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The maid's intelligence is always worrying: "Which one should be asked, please tell me his name, address, characteristics and body related data..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The legendary mage immediately became impatient: "Go out and find a young male mage, smash him, and bring the clothes in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So The direct solution was to let Richard immediately sweat, and quickly said: "No need to do this, I have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun looked at Richard curiously, Say: "What can you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "You can't send it in short distance, then send me directly back to myself. The residential area is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun took a shot of his forehead and slammed the golden hair that was ready to go, shouting: "Yes, how do I forget this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately painted in the air, hooked up a portal, and rushed in with Richard, at the same time, in the residential area of ​​Richard There was also a portal inside, and the naked man was directly thrown out of the portal, and a kiss from the legendary mage was sent inside the door. The next moment, Su Hailun jumped out of his living area and landed heavily on the ground. In his own exclusive area, he followed a young mage and asked him to call all the big magisters to the conference room. Then he threw him away and walked to the conference area. Every step was swaying. There will be a enchanting posture in a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young male mage has never been so close to the legendary mage. For a moment, his brain is dizzy, only to think that some kind of indescribable fate will fall on himself. It is said that the legendary mage ate Richard. At that time, Richard was only ten, and he is now a 12th-level wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the legendary Master walked away, the young male mage who had not been stunned by the nightmare quickly shouted: "His Royal Highness, the content of the meeting is."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s brain is not here at all, instinctively replied in a random way: “On the development of Noland.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mage squatted on the spot, always felt that some of the high, sacred and beautiful things in the heart seemed to have some cracks. He quickly shook his head and forced his intelligence to a few levels, and immediately I feel that the image of Su Hailun is beautiful and beautiful. Moreover, as long as the legendary mage is beautiful and enchanting and graceful, it is enough. Others are embellishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mages of the intellectual drop are flying away, the world is looking for the big magisters, and when they hear the meeting, all the big magisters’ faces They are very strange. The dark blue has not been repaired yet. This has begun to care about the future of Noland. Is it true that Su Hailun’s strength has greatly improved after he woke up, and he created a space burst that cannot be described and can easily flatten the city. Magic, confidence expands, ready to conquer the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But think about it, the legendary mage who is lazy and greedy to sleep can never seem to be an ambitious person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of worries in the big magician, put down all the things in their hands, rushed to the meeting room, black gold is the last one to rush to the conference room, gray The short leg of the dwarf is a cause. He is seriously injured and is a cause. When the gray dwarf pushes the door of the conference room, he sees a strange scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage sits in the position, looks up at the ceiling, his face changes from time to time, is extremely rich, and occasionally laughs a few times unconsciously, while others The big magisters have arrived, all sitting and looking serious, but the strange eyes, but they leaked their minds, the gray dwarf quietly sat in his position, close to the big magician next to him, Quietly speaking in sign language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray dwarf: "His Highness is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
