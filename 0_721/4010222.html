			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night attack, Richard just raised the vigilance of the soldiers and then began to The position of the tree of life marches. The Necromancer once again summoned a large number of low-level undead to let them explore the way first. The undead is now the only means of reconnaissance. The scope of the sacred unicorn against the forest will only be one kilometer. beyond this range, the forest will re-energize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When approaching the periphery of the tree of life, Sandro’s undead suddenly suffered a blow, almost completely destroyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer immediately told Richard that the army of Richard is only five kilometers away from the tree of life. After listening to Sandro’s words and thinking for a moment, Li said: “I can basically confirm that the Green Sens have laid a trap in front of us. Master Pamir, you have a way to deal with the large-scale nature of Druid. Is it a spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the tree people. No big deal, and the dragon of Lina is the nemesis of these trees." Pamir understates Said. Druid's natural spells are not known for their killing, but for their summoning and nourishment. In terms of comprehensive power, awakening a tree in a forest environment is the most powerful magic. This level of magic is not in the eyes of Pamir. He once ruined the entire tribe of Druid elders with a level nine magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, there was a flash of resoluteness, saying, "That's good! The whole army, attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Five hundred soldiers are not good at riding the battle, and finally form a half-riding half-step mixed state, with a loose formation in the forest to quickly advance, rushing to the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green singer in front formed a loose line of defense, which was smashed by the army. The green genie screamed and leaped in the canopy. Deep in the forest. Richard did not care about the retreating elves, but marched straight into the army, and the five elite humanoid knights came out in full, rushing to the position of the tree of life at full speed. Their speed is fast, that is, the Green Sen Elf is not too responsive, and the long arrows that have been killed have fallen behind the horses of the humanoid knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite knight is about one kilometer ahead of the big force, and finally rushes out of the forest and jumps into the grass around the tree of life. When their horses fell on the grass, the elite knights rushed around the circle because they did not see the goal of this war, the tree of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the grass, leaving only a huge pile of soft mounds. A deep impression came from the mound to the forest on the other side. Richard, who saw this scene through the humanoid knight's eyes, immediately knew that the tree of life had migrated and it has become a trap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest around the grass, the fierce screams of the Green Sens are constantly ringing, and the layers of echoes echo in the forest. I don’t know how many elves are hidden in the depths of the forest. . However, the elves were obviously a little confused and confused. They did not think that there were only five knights in the first batch of grasslands. Hundreds of arrows aimed at the five knights at a time, but did not know if they should shoot. Even the Druids hidden in the forest do not know how to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the run, Richard waved his hand, and the other five elite humanoid knights stopped the horses and stopped the entire team. At this time, the team rushed into the forest grass, less than 30 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slammed: "Group soul guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand sand and the team's four big At the same time, the priests cast a group soul guardian, and all five hundred soldiers were covered. Then Pamir vacated and, under the protection of Sher and Agamemnon, flew to the front of the team and began to sing a spell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green elves in the forest were in chaos, and then dozens of sharp arrows broke through and shot Pamir. Everyone knows how terrible it is to let a big magician arbitrarily cast a spell. The elf's smashing arrows were blocked by Sher and Agamemnon, and Richard had a chance to observe Agamemnon's fighting style. The young man was so terrible that the sword's movements were not fancy, even because it was too plain and somewhat rustic. But in the eyes of Richard, I know that Agamemnon has almost no extra action and no waste of effort. On the real battlefield, his combat skills are terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamir finally completed his spell, a huge illusion of a banshee appeared in the forest, she has a beautiful face, and two long 獠The tooth reveals her essence. The banshee imaginary opened his mouth and suddenly made a scream through the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indescribable howling, even if there is a soul guardian, even if the soul is extremely powerful, Richard still feels the heartbeat speeds up, the soul is even more trepidation, there is off The meaning of the body. Once the soul really leaves the body, it is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine-level magical banshee, the power is so big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a soul guardian, there are still more than a dozen of the five hundred warriors who have fallen silently, their faces distorted, and apparently experienced extreme before they died. fear. The Green Sens are completely tragedy, and the banshee's scorpion is far away. The sound of heavy objects falling into the ground is constantly coming from the forest. It is a perfect soul, falling from the tree. The elite humanoid knights in the middle of the grass are also swept by the banshee, but they are completely fine. They have no soul at all, and naturally they will not be affected by the banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the Green Sen Elf was hit hard, ten to five or six, those Green Sens who did not die under the banshee, also suffered multiple injuries . Only the elves who were hiding at the outermost edge of the front line were able to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A banshee screams, Pamir masters fall from the sky, pale, and immediately drink a bottle of powerful vitality. As soon as he was aware of his heart, he ordered the elite knights in the middle of the grass to rush into the forest and slash the fallen elves. With this order, the elite knights will immediately become the targets of the rest of the elves, and it is almost impossible to survive the set fire. However, as the hen's nest said, these combat units are just tools and consumables. Using their principles should be just how to maximize their use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the elite knight rushing into the forest, Richard ordered: "Disperse, the whole army to the left, surround the attack! Stay in the forest, do not enter the grass!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five hundred warriors turned to the squad, and marched along the periphery of the grass. The soldiers saw a lot of fallen spirits along the way, and they did not move at all. There are still struggles. The warriors brought by Richard are all through battles. They don’t tell the elves that they are alive or dead. Only when they meet, they must first insert two knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, the elves’ arrows have become unpredictable, but they have also been weakened. Once Richard's troops enter the open grass, they will immediately become the target of the shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest suddenly vibrates, and a towering old tree has risen up and turned into a group of war trees, there are more than one hundred! The tree man surrounded the team of Richard, the thick branches waved like the wind, and when they were lying on the ground, they roared and the earth shook. This is the second ambush of the Green Sen. However, it is the early preparation of Richard. A piece of dark red flame flew out of the dragon's mage, stuck to any tree and never fell, but continued to burn. The war tree people can still be patient at first, but this kind of flame that blends with the characteristics of dragon inflammation burns for a long time. Once burned through the skin, the tree becomes painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
