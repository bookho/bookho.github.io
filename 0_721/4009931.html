			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him’s face is changing, his eyes are full of shock, humiliation and frenzy, but There is no fear in Richard's anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a highland unicorn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to interrupt Ms. screamed and said, "I know, I also know that your father is the Earl of Atu, and the mother is the cousin of the current king. The nobles of the royal family of Sequoia King usually start with the title of highland, and the unicorn is a good one. Suffix, is this all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him is stunned and unbelievable: "Do you know that you dare to be so rude to me? I, when I return to the territory, I will lead the army to find you, and then I will kill your family and then torture you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And my woman." Richard reminded kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Woman, that little woman is really good, I have never seen such a beautiful eye! After I drain your blood, it will be good Entertain her! First me, then my dog, then my loyal guards..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the smack of Him, Richard frowned slightly, then gently said: "You are not afraid that I will kill you here first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just a little pioneering knight... ..." Shim suddenly did not say anything, he suddenly returned to God, suddenly his face was full of panic, cold sweat pieces from the forehead. He is not completely stupid. He thought that the other party’s force at this time is absolutely suppressed. One can’t run away. If you murder and kill, you will throw yourself into the wilderness. In this uninhabited blood-stained place, it’s really dead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and jumped off the horse and said, "You are not stupid enough to get home. But in order to deepen your impression, I think it is necessary to Additional entertainment programs. You several, the dawn of this distinguished viscount, Oral, give our Viscounts adults ten lashes, remember to use this prince's own whip, the guys in our hands are not advanced enough! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian picked up his clothes very quickly, and in the twinkling of an eye he was stripped naked in the scream of him. Although the Viscount is obese, the skin is white and delicate, and it looks dazzling in white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belly of the black-hearted half-elf swayed the whip, the first one was pumped on the viscount's buttocks, and the whip was turned, the homeopathic thighs The inside left a deep blood mark. Him’s voice was immediately higher than eight degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha raised his hand to stop the second whip of the half-elf, pointing to the position between the two legs of the Viscount, saying: "Attention, Oral, don't I have broken the parts of our dear viscount, but they are very delicate! If I didn't guess wrong, the value of the Viscountian is included in that part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet does not understand the meaning of Richard, but the straightforward command can still be understood. Then his wrist twitched gently, and the whip fell on the ass and on the back of the Viscount, and left a few blood marks on the inside of the sensitive thigh. Of course, he carefully avoided the valuable parts. The Viscount's pig-like screams are higher than a wave, and the fat body seems to have endless energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten whip is not easy to finish, but the Viscount is still screaming. The whip marks are slowly bulging, and the pain of this process is slow and long, not much better than the whiplash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard finally walked to the viscount and reached for the viscount's chin. The distance between the two faces was no more than ten centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Viscount Himm, there is a burning flame, which is a contradiction between the fury and the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled softly, patted Him’s face and said to him: "I am Richard, Richard Akmon. Live my name, and my face, don't forget this time. Also, call back your army as soon as possible after returning, come and find me to avenge. Finally, I am a knight, not a knight. Find out the difference between the two, and you won’t make such a stupid mistake next time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard stood up and took out A handkerchief, began to wipe the hand that had just taken the face of Him, this action seems to be no less than the ten whip of the noble unicorn Viscount. The anger on the fat face seemed to suffocate him in the next moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of the naked body was thrown to the ground, and the guards with good hands and feet immediately lifted him up and took off his clothes and put them on. The guards who had been cut off by the right hand had already wrapped the wounds themselves, endured the pain, and hurried away with the Viscount. As for the body of the companions on the ground, no one will pay attention, just prepared to stay to feed Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gradual disappearance of Viscount Heim, Richard shook his head and pointed to the guards who had good hands and feet and said, "I want them, At this time, I will definitely find a way to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After they go back..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Definitely, the right hand will not be spared," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should you treat that white/idiot?" In her opinion, there are many ways to learn to clean up this arrogant guy. The best way is to kill, and then let the wind teeth eat the body, so that no trace will remain. The method used by Richard seems to be directly fierce, but it also leaves the most troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we need enemies now, Viscount Heim is a good enemy." Richard smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then..." Richard paused and said, "He dares to beat my woman's idea, then I will leave a shadow for his second half!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team moved on, and at dusk the next day, it has arrived at the first true territory of Richard in this plane, with more than 100 The small village of Bran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blan is located at the foot of the mountain, there is a small river passing by the village, and the passage from the kingdom to the blood-stained land is less than ten kilometers. Further southeast is the turbulent land of jungles, swamps and mountain cliffs. In that untouched area, the nest is wandering, sweeping all the powerful creatures that can be caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stay in Bran Village for a long time. He met the village head and some elders in the village to understand the composition of the village population and the surrounding conditions. I left Bran and went to the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, dozens of spurs rushed out of the forest, escorting the winds that tied the baggage on both ends into the forest, while others stayed At the side of Richard, he made up for the number of twenty. The goal that Richard can now take care of at the same time is twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
