			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the soul of Richard, a gray wave is rushing ! This is the impact of destruction and death, fiercely rushing to every corner of Richard's body, wanting to smash his soul together with the vitality. In the depths of Richard's soul, the troll supervised army suddenly appeared! The warlord Della Kazan actually projected his consciousness into the soul of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of Drakazan, Richard’s figure also appeared, which is a symbol of his total will and soul power. The Troll Superintendent screamed and screamed, pressing the giant palm against Richard's head and shouting: "Your Majesty! In the presence of the Warlord Della Kazan, even the predators of different worlds must surrender!"察 /><br /><br /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>< Of course, there is no possibility of skeletal fragmentation at the level of the soul. Richard will have this illusion, which is entirely due to the difference between the soul power and the troll warlord. And Richard knows that once he really squats, it means giving in. From then on, the will will be enslaved by the trolls, and even a part of the soul will be taken away. Eventually, his body will be lost like the trolls. Wisdom is only living by instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard is not afraid, not worried, and some are just humiliation! At the age of eight, Ilani taught him to be tough. From the time of sensible, until the age of ten, Ilani is telling Richard with his own words and deeds, what is dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troll warlord, but wants Richard to be in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure is getting heavier and heavier, and Richard gasps fiercely as if he feels that he has carried a mountain. But he is desperately insisting that he would rather die than to kneel down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the world of the soul, Richard’s right knee was soft and he broke into the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the turning point for everything, and the beginning of the volcanic eruption! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that every drop of blood was burning, breathing became hot, and the wind was sucking in, and the fire was exhaled! The great shame occupies every darkest corner in his heart, leaving him nowhere to hide, nowhere to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked up and looked up at the Warlord, suddenly making a beast-like call sign! In his left knee, the sound of the bones bursting, the muscles were arrogant, the body was shaking, and he slowly rose from the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls of the trolls were shocked, and then the madness was greatly increased, and the strength of the giant palms doubled, and the resistance of Richard was to be suppressed. However, the Warlord suddenly felt an indescribable burning pain in his hand, and immediately saw that Richard was burning all over the body. The flame was deep and thick, like a piece of flowing lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard’s body, Archimonde’s blood is bursting with unparalleled heat, and each reticular blood is thicker, inside. The rushing lava is faster and the temperature is higher. As soon as the lava erupted from the blood, it turned into a raging prison fire and gathered away from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly entered a very wonderful state, his main consciousness was furious, and the second consciousness was cold and cruel. The two extremes are clearly opposite, but they are one without each other. He opened his eyes and looked at Dra Kazan, angry and ruthless. Richard did not notice that the Troll Superintendent, who was much taller than himself, was a little shorter than himself at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Troll Warlord, Richard has stood up straight, but the height has not yet reached his waist. Just looking at him with cold eyes, it is a demon formed by the flames of Richard! This demon is not clear, and there is nothing wrong with it, but it is just standing there, so that Drakazan has an indescribable heart! The Troll Supervisor found that in front of this demon, it began to fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demon has a pair of golden eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll warlord suddenly remembered something and cried: "How...what will it be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But he still couldn't finish the words, the demon screamed, and the image of the Troll Warlord immediately blew through the hurricane, completely distorted, and then slammed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his eyes and looked around. The altar is empty, and the shadow of the Troll Superintendent has long since disappeared. The maple amber in the stone basin has burned out, and there is still smoke in the air. In the temple, the earth is covered with humanoid warriors, knights and throwing soldiers. Most of the followers also fell to the ground, only the sand and Iraq were safe and sound. Sandro and Clark are still awake, but their faces are gray and ugly. The unicorn fell to the ground, a weak look, and the horns lost their luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice fell on the altar, and the blood in the body had already drained, and all were absorbed into the altar. There is no breath of life in him, just like the troll mad warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All indications are that the Warlord Della Kazan did exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes again, and now the world in his soul is somewhat confused with reality. He still remembers that under his extreme anger, he seems to have broken away from the bondage and the power is completely bursting. Then he just screamed at the Troll Supervisor, and the Troll Superintendent in his soul completely disintegrated. At the last moment, the fear in the eyes of the superintendent still makes Richard remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All followers are still alive, this is the most gratifying thing for Richard, but the will is weaker, such as Oral, it is possible It takes a while to recuperate. Most of the combat units created by the Brood were intact, but they were shocked and fell to the ground. Drajanzan’s gun of the soul is a soul attack, and it does not have much effect on those who have no souls and are only born for war. But the elite warriors with wisdom have suffered heavy losses and are almost completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure eternal dragon temple priest and pastor, almost unaffected. Flowing sand and Iowa will be gone, but only six grades of Sisuo are nothing, but they are amazed by Richard. The fallen gods were all very hard-rooted, and even the 13th-level Clark was not spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the true priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple have their own uniqueness in resisting soul attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and found that the sand and Iowa were staring at themselves, and the strange look was like watching a monster. This is a very rare thing. Richard touched his face and determined that he did not become another person. However, the quicksand and the hot eyes of Iowo made Richard feel a little restless. He immediately decided to take the initiative to break the situation, so he asked: "Troll Supervisor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence asks, the expression of quicksand and Io is even more strange. In the end, Io said: "You really don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is somewhat inexplicable: "How can I know?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel stared at Richard for a long time and said: "Well, I didn't see you being stupid! You just screamed at the trolls, and the result The child smashed him! This is a soul of at least 18th level, and has the powerful skills of a soul gun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
