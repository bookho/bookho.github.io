			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam raised the axe, just started to scream, the water splashed on the toe A little, quietly passing over him. The white robes that wrapped her body suddenly flew out of the body, as a cloud cover fell on Sam's head, enveloping his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam was shocked and hurriedly reached out and slammed it. As soon as he raised his hand, he hit a critical strike on the back of his head. The girl used the knife back, only listening to the muffled sound, Sam's strong body straight down, and the robes wrapped his head tighter. For a time, Sam only felt that he was spinning around, and Venus was in the air, but he could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under panic, Sam wants to get up, but he has a heavy blow on his head, almost letting him go back. Next, the heavy blow fell like a raindrop, continually crushing his already strong body. The suffocating slamming even made him illusion, as if he was on the hillside, and then a whole team of mammoths was passing by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard sees is another sight. The splash of water flashed behind Sam, then covered his head with a robes and knocked him back with a knife. Then Gangde rushed over and punched and kicked Sam, who was blindfolded. Then the ogre also joined the ranks of the beaten dog. Looking at the water, the Gangde and the three-pointer, surrounded by Sam's evil, even kicked the shackles, but just right to avoid the critical part of the death, Richard could not help but sighed his eyes, reluctantly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought this was a tactic that was only popular in the dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield on the other side is devastating, there are various negative spells such as the ogre magician throwing slowness, and the singer of the elf poet, the two teams The strength is not at the same level. Moreover, Sam’s men were horrified to discover that these people’s enthusiasm was better than they were, and the level of mutual cooperation was not in the same plane. In a twinkling of an eye, Sam’s men were cut down in half. Several cavalrymen were surrounded by the wind and the wind, and then they were chopped by the wind blades that flew in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the battle is over. Including Sam, only eight people were captured, and the others were all cut down. Many of them were too slow to be killed and lost. Sam is still fierce, but he has been beaten to the point where he can't stand even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard added more than a dozen horses, plus a simple camp. The knights from the military squad skillfully cleaned the battlefield and searched for spoils. On Sam, he did find a few bloody brand names. It seems that these people in Sam should be here to collect the road tax, but Richard’s wealth and women have made him slightly deviate from the initial goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finishing the battlefield, the Elf poet took the time to interrogate the captured prisoners. He has learned a lot from the dark world of penalties and interrogation skills from Richard, and has shown amazing talent in this regard. Perhaps Oral’s character without a moral bottom line has contributed to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked freely in the camps and levels, taking every detail into the eye. Finally, he stayed in front of a few simple roadblocks, quietly Thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Richard suddenly smiled and said to the running sand: "I suddenly have some new ideas, at least I know how to do this in the future. Making money on the land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robbery, this is the fastest." The water that passed by from the side was cold and inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is a glimpse, actually nodded and said: "In fact, I think about the same, at least the same."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really to rob?" However, Richard, who already knows her, knows that most of the concerns about sand drifting are whether the benefits and risks match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Robbery? This is a good job!" The three-pointer who is not far away said with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the crowd or doubts, or expecting, or excited eyes, Richard said: "In fact, it is essentially the same as robbery. We charge cards!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting a card fee? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, everyone has not responded for the time being. This money can be used in the future. Just look at the road card that was dropped. You can know the camp. In the middle of poverty, I can hardly find anything that can be exchanged for money. The most valuable thing besides the horse is that there are only people left. These warrior fighters can still be worth a little money if they sell as an effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard does not intend to explain, and now is only a preliminary idea. In the future, his power will spread throughout the blood-stained land, and the road card will be used to control all traffic traffic. At that time, the financial resources are called rolling. In Richard's calculations, this income will eventually accumulate a large number that will surprise him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the captured people, Richard felt that except for Sam, everyone else had obvious fears. The big man Sam was beaten up by his face from the beginning. This street-style fighting style made him feel uncomfortable humiliation, and he did not see how his own defeated him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Sam is a desperate man who relies on instinct and fierceness to fight. And Richard's men, from the water to the knights and the captives who surrendered, are either regular trained soldiers or murder machines that have grown up in special circumstances. There is no room for comparison between a group of rabble and an elite army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the prisoners and pulled out a white handkerchief, slowly wiping the hand that was originally spotless, and said slowly and gracefully: "You From now on, it’s all my people. But if anyone wants to use my trust and kindness, think about the pile of bodies over there, they are all your companions. And I, you now The owner, Richard Archimonde, will only give you a tolerance. If you betray me, such as running away, or even a direct rebellion, then the only thing that falls into my hands is death. And I Can guarantee..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a moment before saying: "...this process will be quite painful and lengthy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage has had a noticeable effect, and even when Richard’s gaze passed, even Sam was a little cringe. Richard's gaze came back on Sam's face and landed on his long, clean and stable fingers. This is a pair of elegant and white hands like a woman, and the source of countless costumes and magic. Richard wiped his spotless fingers again and said faintly: "Sam, I will always look at you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An understatement makes a big man Sam felt inexplicably chilly and couldn't help but chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
