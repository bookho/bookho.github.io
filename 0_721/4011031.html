			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time the soul flies, Richard will feel a little strange power into his soul, and his soul will gradually become stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, every time you take a little bit of soul power, Richard will feel the body become heavier. The souls of these war dead still retain the memories of their lives, their emotions and their unwillingness to let go. Although they do not directly enter the consciousness of Richard, but if Richard needs it, he can read it at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces that appear on the tetrahedron are the fulfillment of these soul conscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s these memories, emotions, and wishes that let Richard understand that these are all flesh and blood, each of them has their own ideas, their own stories, There are people who are concerned about themselves and those who are concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Faro decided to fight the reaper, Richard had already felt this way, but it was never as clear as it was at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of Norland, Charles the Great, who set the peak of human martial arts, once had a famous saying that was counted by countless lords: "When you set foot on the eclipse When we land, we don’t see life, just numbers and resources.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Nolanders, everything in the secondary plane can be considered a resource . Indeed, when a lord experiences one after another and has seen countless specific races, this feeling often arises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles is the most powerful commentary on this famous quote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has collected tens of millions of fighters from various planes and swarmed into the abyss. For the first time, human beings have formed a quantitative advantage over the devil's territory. The warriors of each face paved the way to the Dragon Palace with their own soul and flesh. Stepping on this scarlet avenue, Charles the Great was able to use the Dragon Slayer to smash the head of the dragon to create a martial art that no one could match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was once a member of these lords, but gradually he took another path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tetrahedron is the projection of Richard's soul. As the above face increased, Richard also felt that his heart was becoming heavy. He now understands that every decision of his own will affect the lives and deaths of thousands of people and affect the ups and downs of more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around and saw what he saw, but he didn't know what it was like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, as Richard’s soul power increased, his body suddenly shocked, and the real name from the blood of the elf emerged, then broken and broken down into The tiniest runes circling in the soul space. At the moment, there are countless light spots in the soul of Richard, which are incorporated into these runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These spots are all from the souls that have just been absorbed, and each soul contributes a little bit of power to Richard, although this power is negligible, but when they When the number reaches a certain scale, it has become extremely impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiniest runes accumulate under the new rules, forming slightly larger new runes. These runes are combined again to become larger, more complex runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the new real name finally appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This real name consists of only two runes, they are the purest order runes, without any other power, representing the complete rules of order. Richard knows that along this path, the real name will continue to grow stronger until the end of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new real name, named Isa, means redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dynasty’s attack on Archimonde ended in an unexpectedly fiasco, shocking the entire Noland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war sacred tree dynasty 300,000 troops only fled back to less than 20,000 people, almost the entire army. Dozens of strong people above the Sanctuary were killed by Richard in a face-to-face, and the two legendary powers who were leaning on the mainstay did not fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only 20,000 to 30,000 people killed in the battle of 300,000 troops. Other casualties are from trampling in chaos. Nearly 200,000 people eventually became the captives of Archimonde. One of the seven dukes who fought was killed and five people were captured. Only one person disguised as a soldier successfully escaped to the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical images of this battle spread throughout the continent in a blink of an eye, and all the powerful lords are studying these images. Although the image is incomplete, several key images are enough to be thrilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nightmare-like frost tyrannosaurus knight, inadvertently revealing the real strength of the night elf big shooter, and flying and rushing, can be called the battlefield killing machine The blade hunters have made these veteran lords stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all super-high-level units with the same strength as the knights. The most terrible is the scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface of the sacred dynasty, the cause was that the strong group was killed by Richard. But in fact, it is because of the strength of these ultra-high-level units. Those ordinary fighters have no resistance at all, and they are slaughtered into pieces. Eventually, morale collapses rapidly, which leads to chaos. Since then, the defeat has been overwhelming and can no longer be cleaned up. <br /><br />############################################################################################################ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of the sacred tree dynasty is the act of Alice, and she has two legends and ten sacred sects for her, and then she returns Arrived at Faro. It is time to completely solve the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the encirclement of Richard did not participate, but was carried out by Asa, Goshawk and No Face, and then a group of female worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He himself plunged into the ancient library of the Stars and began a final analysis of the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of the huge ship has been fully analyzed, and now only the reverse analysis of the mother ship is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the acceleration effect of the ancient experimental platform, and part of the work to the mother nest, after ten days, Richard finally built a model of the mother ship, analysis The degree reached more than 98%, and only a few core areas have yet to be perfected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this model, Richard found a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where the Reaper’s mindset is? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a miniature warplane or a giant ship, Richard has not been able to find a device similar to a thinking hub. They are more like receiving instructions from the outside and then following the instructions. So now it seems that this thinking center should be on the mother ship. But how does the reaper send instructions to such a long distance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul connection between Richard and the mother's nest can't exceed 500 kilometers. After the distance is exceeded, it can only rely on the brain relay. Is the reaper the same? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is the relationship between the mother's nest and the reaper, why is the mother's nest suddenly not affected by the harvester's control instructions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions can't find an answer right now, and Richard knows that when he finds the mother ship, he will naturally have an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard walked out of the lab, Goshawk and others had completed the interception mission. All the power metal was dismantled, and the wreckage was initially refined by the Goshawk, turning into a huge piece of metal one meter square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately fired the blue fire, carried out the final refining, and then showed the analytical model of the mother ship, explaining the structure and possible of the mother ship to the strongmen present. The function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the explanation was completed, Richard immediately ordered the Goshawk, Asa and No Face, and contacted the mountains and the sea that had been in the turbulent land. These four people will cover Richard's direct attack on the Reaper's last base, and then Richard will automatically solve the Reaper's mother ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and Sea is an unexpected candidate, because Richard found that she did not know why she joined the soul network, and her strength has soared, physical strength and Vitality has risen to an incredible height, only about strength and physical strength, and mountains and seas have been chasing Richard. This is super strong level data! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mountains and the sea did not know what method to use, and once again restored the saint totem, now her strength and resilience have been greatly increased, pure power has been pressed After Richard, he approached Su Hailun. The resilience is comparable to that of tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, the mountain and the sea are now the same beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also couldn’t help but have some talents for mountains and seas. The blood of the beast god is really powerful and speechless. She only slept for a few years, and she was awakened by power and crossed the legend directly from the tenth level. Originally, this was already a miracle. Richard did not expect to pay attention to it for a short period of time. The mountain and sea capabilities actually reached this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you simply look at the data, the mountains and the sea are roughly equal to the nest. You know, the mother's nest is a huge body with nearly two kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard set the time for the final assault, suddenly another consciousness came in: "I want to participate!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange and familiar voice, very sweet, but with a difficult wild nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately felt that a fire had suddenly ignited outside the hospital, and a group of fires with a strong abyss. It is also a legendary strongman, and being able to appear outside the hospital without causing Richard's vigilance is enough to prove strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!" Richard said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the plane of Faro, Richard almost completely resolved the underlying rules of the plane, with an undisputed home advantage. It is with Asa, Richard has the confidence to win, if it is a legend, whether it is ordinary or senior, or even like the Goshawk is close to the legend of the super strong threshold, Richard is killing a few knives. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard door opened and walked into a tall, hot young woman with a red hair bundled into a ponytail, like a flame of jumping. She is very beautiful, and it is the kind of beauty with violent and wild nature. When she walks in, it will make people feel that it is a burning fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." Richard frowned. He doesn't remember that he has such a young and hot girl on his or her own battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful girl has a legendary level of strength, and the control of the abyss flame has been superb. She would have been famous if she was under Richard. Maybe she is like a natural disaster, just joined the strong of Archimonde? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl jumped to the front of Richard, behind her hands, leaning forward, approaching a very dangerous distance, then smiled: "You guess!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee looked at a board and said: "Quickly say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This questioning, Li The power of the rules has been faintly used, and the flame of the girl suddenly disappeared, and she was shocked. The little face became white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately understood that Richard intended to warn, immediately pouted, a pair of crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Thanks to the new ally Gdfgadg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
