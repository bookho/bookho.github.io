			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas stared at these people, only a moment later He said, "His Royal Highness, you come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin said faintly: "If I don't come, wouldn't you let me?" Representing the whole church, the Lord said that arrogance is the greatest sin, St. Thomas, today's things, and when I go back, I will discuss it at the cardinal meeting. I think that you are no longer suitable to take charge of the Church Knights." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After St. Thomas’s glance, the respect on his face faded away, straightening his body and saying, “His Royal Highness of St. Martin, can I take charge of the Church Knights, too? It’s not that you can say the finale. Even if you want to make a mistake at the cardinal meeting, you have to do it today. Now, here, I am the president of the cardinal master. The decision is the decision of the church. As for you, it’s still good. Think about how to deal with heresy and false believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin Laughter, said: "You are accusing me of being unreligious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The belief is pious, can only be judged by the Lord, but yours Behavior, but not in the interests of the church." St. Thomas's voice is gradually improving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard said, "Martin, I have already explained to you the cause of this incident. The church executives must have known it, but this St. Thomas still appears here, and to say such things, then I think that some of the great people in the church have already made a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to St. Thomas, he said slowly: "His Royal Highness, since you want to make a decision instead of the church, you must be very clear about the cause and effect of the whole thing. If this is the case, then I will give up that The descendants of the birth are good, but this is the blood of the generation, are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas's face suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generation of blood, this is a word that will not be easily used, it means that both families will enter an endless bloody battle until one party is completely destroyed until. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of St. Thomas, Richard, who was divorced from the Holy Alliance, was only a small lord in the place, and bullying was bullied, even though he moved the god Mujin. The consequences of the incident are much more serious than expected, but if Richard is sufficiently interesting to no longer support St. Martin, it is not a big deal to give him some more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard chose the most intense form of confrontation, which aroused the boundless anger of St. Thomas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Paladin's view, everything the church does is done in the will of God. It is absolutely correct. As for the descendants of Richard, I heard that Some talents, what's there, the genius on the mainland is more than that, compared with the dignity of the church, this little thing is worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when St. Thomas came along, he took the initiative to gather a lot of private leaders, that is, to prepare to destroy Richard in the territory of the dynasty, he wants the world to see And what is the end of the church for the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generation of blood is a result that St. Thomas did not anticipate. The Paladin wanted to rely on the power of the church and the dynasty to force Richard, and Richard in turn Name St. Thomas and his family as revenge objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas’s eyes narrowed and said coldly: “Richard, you dare to threaten the paladin of the Church of Light.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahe smiled and said: "You also threaten a legendary mage and a holy constructor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas When the pupil shrinks, the face becomes very ugly. If a legendary mage disregards his identity and starts with his people, it is a real disaster. Even if St. Thomas has the support of the church, it is difficult to capture a legendary mage. whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas gave a heavy sigh and said, "You are not ordinary arrogance. Before the glory of the Lord, anyone should be humble. Now, I will Teach you this truth, the Lord's knights, ready to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, bleak horn sounded, the church knights put the following armor, and the battle ride began to be violent. Ground the soil with iron hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, St. Martin flew to the battlefield zhōng yāng and shouted: "The Lord's knights, let go of your weapons, now I declare as the Son, Thomas is no longer suitable to serve as the head of the Church Knights and dismissed on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church knights suddenly sāo move, I don’t know how to be good, holy Martin's position in the church is detached. It can be said that it is second only to the pope. Now the orders of the Son and the Paladin are the opposite. The Cavaliers do not know who to listen to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas was furious and pointed to Martin and said: "You dare to disobey the order of the Principal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be sure that the order given to you by the PSD is not yours. The one just said." St. Martin did not let. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Paladin also has his own confidant, he snorted, his hand waved forward, thousands of church knights immediately marched forward, in their Driven by the rest, the church knights began to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since someone took the lead, more and more fighters followed, and soon the entire army began to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s eyes flashed, his hand waved, nearly 100 followers flew behind him, footed in the light, floating in the air, Martin said: The Lord's knights, stop your steps, and go forward, that is, against me, you must attack the Lord's Son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church Knight Suddenly, many involuntarily arrested the horses. For the knights with devout faith, the Son is equivalent to the embodiment of the shining Lord God in the human world. Attacking the Son is equal to waving the sword to the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those knights who belong to the Paladin, after hesitating, bite their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s face was heavy and he snorted. In the entourage behind him, suddenly several people were wrapped in the robe and could not see clearly. The original person flew over a hundred meters, and then spread the light wing behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church knights suddenly became amazed. This is an angel, a heavenly people, a servant who serves God, and a scepter and sword in the hands of God. It is the only Son of the church. At this time, there are angels around him, which shows the Lord’s love for Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, what God loves is justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this, even the church knights who are most loyal to Thomas can't help but stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly rides on the magic ride, glances at St. Thomas, who is angry with anger, and then goes to his army, he knows Things won't end so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the east of the battlefield, Richard perceives large-scale spatial fluctuations and will soon be transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, in the direction that Richard perceives, a loud hymn is suddenly heard, and half of the sky is as bright as dawn, and the light is rolling down from the sky. In the air, a magnificent gate is outlined and condensed into a ground in front of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slowly opened, and one and another paladin wearing a white robe walked out of it, and then the cardinal dressed in red robes, then It is a cardinal in red with a gold ribbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, from the gate of the Light, the cardinal Lutheran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in front of the Gate of Light, there are nearly a thousand senior church members standing on the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Feide said slowly: "St. Martin, do you want to abandon God's care for you and do it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lufide reprimanded without hesitation as soon as he came up, and his voice spread throughout the battlefield under the influence of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin does not move, faintly said: "You are the one who rejects God. When the judgment rì arrives, whoever is guilty, naturally there will be justice. Conclusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are helping the enemy of the church and the dynasty, this is betrayal, do you want to be heresy?" Lufide's voice is getting more and more Loud, there is a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin sneered and said: "When I heard that the Lord's chosen Son will become a heresy, Lufide, your courage is getting bigger and bigger. If you have the power, you will dare to do what you want. You have to kill me even in order to deal with me. Even if you are not heresy, then what is heresy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, the church knights are all confused, not knowing who to listen to, one is the Son, the other is the Cardinal, both can be said to be in a position The mutual accusations of the two sides have become more and more severe and there is no room for manoeuvre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a very dazzling light beam suddenly appeared on the door of the Light, straight into the sky, always shining to the end of the void that the naked eye could not see. Immediately, a feeling of indescribableness was quietly pressed into everyone’s mind, which was solemn and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
