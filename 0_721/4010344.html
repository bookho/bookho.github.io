			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissella is a famous sea beast in the deep sea, I don’t know how many years existed. With the strength to compete with the gods, this giant python named after the disco is from the hands of a dragon gnome, an alchemist, and it takes a year to complete, and the power is worthy of such a loud name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the source of the equipment of Archimonde, this is a spoils of Gordon. I don’t know what kind of consideration he was at the time. Instead, it was built on the defensive black rose castle. It is said to make up for the lack of the castle's long-range defense capability. The trebuchet is very old after all, but everyone is very skeptical, and the weak force of Archimonde will also A strong attacking tradition, whether Gordon will use it for a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate future, this legendary giant will obviously become a very threatening obstacle on Richard’s path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissella can have a range of up to ten kilometers, more than the vast majority of magic, and it is equipped with two equally legendary arrows. It is called the tide of the deep sea and the front of the deep sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea magic that can trigger a large area, powerful in the environment of the Bohai Sea, can instantly turn the flat into a sea mud, is to deal with The best choice for repacking the other, the other is the power of super long range and magic tracking, it is a big killer against a single target, in addition to the other arrows of the Deskra Fury A variety of magical powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the lookout of the Black Rose Castle, a group of people dressed in aristocratic costumes are standing on the platform, regardless of the strong winds , forcefully open your eyes and look into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle is an old master, the gray hair beard and the wrinkles on his face all indicate his age and physical condition, level 14 The magic is not bad, but at his age it is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old mage is the speaker of the family council. He is still a jazz. He has a small territory in a distant place. Such a speaker is naturally very It is difficult for other lawmakers to be convinced, so the members of the parliament are divided into four or five groups, standing on the observatory, each group has its own core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still less than 30 members left now, and the size of more than 70 people in the peak period is much worse. The threat of Richard is real and effective, but these are all those who are attached to the Marquis of Sauron. If they dare to renounce the identity of a member, then they don't have to wait until Richard comes, and the Marquis will destroy them first. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old master in the middle knows that his identity as a speaker is a false title, but the shelf is more than the real speaker. He is squeezing some sore eyes. While speaking with a low voice, "take tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young nobleman ran down diligently and ran back attentively. I have a cup of hot black tea in my hand, and I have added milk and sugar to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people’s eyes are showing contempt, and even some people deliberately screamed out loud, but the old master and the young aristocrats only did not hear, no see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who can serve the old Master attentively can imagine how high the identity can be. This young man is not even a minimum aristocrat. The identity of the point is the apprentice of the mage, but he does not like to wear the gown of the mage. He is always swayed by the aristocratic clothing. The verbal hang is always "how is our real aristocrat..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old speaker obviously does not mind the young people's problems, just mind that there is no way, because he is not available, his magic is justified, but the other side of the mage can make money, including alchemy, pharmaceutical and magic The processing of materials is at a level, and life is naturally embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he took the black tea and took a sip of the rack, but almost sprayed it out, the tea was too inferior, the sugar was too much, and the milk seemed to It has gone bad, but the old speaker forced himself to swallow it, and then asked: "Is there not a caravan to come today, why haven't you seen them yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The old speaker is very much looking forward to the caravan, because there will be one of his assigned materials, as the speaker, his treatment is slightly better than other members, just a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man thought about it. It seems that there is such a thing. He said, "Maybe something went wrong on the road. Did they run into Richard?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old speaker scornfully said: "The owner of the caravan is the nephew of Count Tudor, Richard is just a little guy with no hair, he dares to move. Caravan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man said it again and again, but when he thought about it, he did not have the confidence as the old Master, and he cautiously asked: "The Speaker of the House..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Excellency." The old speaker majesticly corrected the 'error' of the young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Speaker, according to your vision, can we keep the Black Rose Castle? I heard that Richard is a royal builder. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Builder, what about that?" The old speaker laughed exaggeratedly and attracted everyone’s attention before he sneered. Said: "How long has Richard been a royal builder? A kid with no foundation can compare with the real old man. I can tell you one thing here, that is, Richard only took it this time. Five hundred cavalry, five hundred, why he brought so few people, and is a full cavalry, not just to be able to avoid the interception of the nobles along the way, on the way he came, there are Mensa, Yang Sen, and Sauron And the army of Goliath, if he brought a large army, he can still drive under the black rose castle. Therefore, young people should think more about their brains, don’t believe anything in rumors, even if Richard really came. Like, we have a castle, a mage, and five thousand defenders, he can play black Fortress, this is a fortress that never sinks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master’s words say that the House of Representatives nodded and felt a hanging heart down. A lot of people, but young people do not think so, he would like to ask, is Richard not already announced his marching line, it seems that it is not afraid of someone intercepting halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old Master’s words seem to be somewhat convincing, and Richard really only took five hundred rides on the road, and five hundred rides to do enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black rose castle has been occupied by the family council since then, and the system left by Gordon has long since fallen apart. It is no longer a well-informed place, due to the arrears of expenses. For the sake of reason, the intelligence points set up by the Alliance and the Royal Family have been removed. Some daily news, except for the Marquis of Sauron, who intends to tell them, is the only original channel that relies on the business. Of course, they can also How much useful real news can be obtained by relying on the respective family, but the marginalized branches themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Soren told the parliament that there was a choice, for example, telling them that Richard had brought five hundred knights, but did not tell them that one of the five hundred knights One hundred and fifty is the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know exactly this news, then I believe that these lawmakers will run away immediately, even if it is facing the wrath of Sauron. This is the same reason as they did when they threatened to investigate, and they first tried to escape. The murder of the murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old speaker took two teas and handed it back to the young man, then picked up his toes and tried to look into the distance, in anticipation of seeing what should have happened long ago. That caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did see the smoke rising at the end of the road, but it didn’t seem like a caravan, and the lawmakers found out the same, so they tried to look forward to it. The table was crowded and wanted to see more clearly. They also looked forward to the arrival of the caravan so that there were two more pieces of ham in the dinner plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not like a caravan, how do you feel like a cavalry? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk nonsense, where are the cavalry now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to bet, Lao Tzu When you were young, you were a soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been a soldier, but I have never heard of a fight."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the noisy congressmen, a young soldier suddenly shouted: "It’s a cavalry, and it’s a wake-up call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This scream immediately caused confusion in the middle of the members. They screamed and shouted. They didn’t know where to run, but they didn’t know what to do, but the chaotic members blocked the young sentinel’s way. He failed to sound the alarm at the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm bell finally rang, the black rose castle woke up from a deep sleep, this ancient fortress has not experienced a war readiness alarm for a long time, Gordon’s cronies I was cleared out early, leaving behind some ordinary chores. At this moment, I heard the alarm bells. There were crowds everywhere in the castle. The exclamation, the anger and the screams of the women were intertwined. Only the chaos could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the defenders of the castle are actually composed of the private forces of the parliamentarians. They are known as 5,000. In fact, they are only less than four thousand, and more than half are For a long time, there has not been a rigorous training of oil, and the real combat power is actually the defender left by Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
