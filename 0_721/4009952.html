			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Moon is about forty years old, a silver-gray weight A, tall, full of steel whiskers, the weapon used to use is a heavy hand. Most of the maneuvers he brought were the sergeant's mobile cavalry, which took into account the maneuverability and combat capability. In general, the combat power was not weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after seeing the Lord of the Moon and the reinforcements he brought, Richard could only helplessly sigh. If there were no such people last night, the castle at dusk had already been washed by Sinclair. There is no magician in the reinforcements brought by the Lord. There are only two sacrifices. If such a force is in the field outside the castle at dusk and in the Sinclair field, it is hard to say that it is difficult to say that it can escape if it is the first strongman. At the beginning, we can see the situation and take the initiative to escape as the primary goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Month and the Duke of the Duke and Richard met at the camp to confirm the results of yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield traces and the corpses that have been piled up in the mountains make the arrogant Lord of the Moon bear also reveal a dignified color. He does not even avoid the dirty and scent, and personally checked it. The wounds on several corpses, the more they look at the complexion, the more dignified they look. The look of Richard is not ignorant and skeptical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the intention of retaining several of the town bear knights and the remnants of the konjac, is even more so that the Lord of the Bears secretly shocked. Although no body is intact, it is entirely possible to see the power of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke's messenger is an old jazz, and his body is subtly modified, and his manners are gentle and elegant, and he is impeccable everywhere. Accompanied by Richard, the Jazz turned around the entire military camp and kept everything in sight. The Jazz was very talkative. He talked with Richard about the history and customs of the Duke, but he did not ask about the origin of Richard. He only vaguely mentioned the situation of the preparation of the building. He suggested that Richard should deal with the postwar as soon as possible. Then, immediately set off to see the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a day, the people in the Baron Fontaine’s family’s attitude towards Richard changed a lot, always intentionally or unintentionally, and wanted to let Richard leave the baron as soon as possible. territory. This is a sign of the power struggle within the family. The baron died too suddenly. The eldest son of the inheritance title was still a child. The baron's own squadron was almost killed in the war, so the baron's eldest son had no armed forces in his hands. Although many of the widows of Baron Fontaine were present to witness, he let the second son follow the decision of Richard to serve the true God, but he was able to use the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this struggle, Richard also read a lot from the book. For any family with a history of more than a hundred years, the internal interests are intricate. Although the title and the castle are indisputable to belong to the baron's eldest son, there are many other interests in the territory. The sum of these interests is not worse than the dusk castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the disputes within the Baron of Baron, Richard couldn’t help but intervene, but was persuaded by the sand. Now is not the time for interference. After waiting for the Duke, it is the time when the overall situation has been fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke messenger stayed for another day and urged Richard to go on the road. Lord Moon Bear stayed to help defend the baron of Fontaine, who was in an extremely empty state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Month once proposed to look at Richard’s ‘behemoth’. Richard knew that the Lord was talking about the hen’s nest, and certainly could not show him. So it is ridiculous that it is a magical summoning creature, and each summoning takes a huge price and has a long cooling period. The Lord will be suspicious, but he has not continued to pursue it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Richard finally arrived in the deep rock city built on the hill, and is also the largest city on the Duke of the Wolf. The Duke’s castle is standing on the side of the mountain, overlooking the vast wilderness below. From afar, the castle occupies the sunny side of the entire mountain from the top of the mountain to the top of the mountain. It is even larger than the black rose castle of the Archimonde family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep rock city is very prosperous, the building style is rough and tidy, it seems that the city was built very well at the time of the city planning, many tall buildings are made of boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge city with a population of more than 100,000. There are thousands of Knights of the Wolf Knights outside the city. There are three thousand people in the city. If you count the other armies scattered throughout the territory, and the troops that can be recruited from the vassal, when necessary, the Duke of the Wolf can summon a 30,000-scale army, which is close to the army that the royal family can mobilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of Deep Rock City are as high as 30 meters. It is extremely majestic in the distance, and it is even more shocking when you look down the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around in front of the city gate and looked up. After a few minutes, he followed the Duke messenger into the deep rock city. This time the jazz did not urge him and was his own city. So attractive and proud. However, Richard is using the tactical commander's eyes to analyze the data in the field of vision. Such a magnificent city, if there are 10,000 people stationed, can face the 50,000 army and can hold on for quite a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the gate, Richard noticed that there was a hanging grille made of thick steel bars in front of the gate, and the gate was installed. On the rails, a giant steel door driven by a winch is required. Such a city gate is no longer a general siege device that can be blasted. It can only rely on the strong to forcibly rush to the city and open the position for the follow-up troops on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pioneers of the city’s heads are undoubtedly walking on the dead, even if the Sanctuary is not really dead, there is no direct help, and the event space is extremely The limited walls are under siege, and any strong person may be able to smash the sand. Just look at the ending of Sinclair at the dusk of the old castle, not to mention the deep rock city. As one of the three Dukes of the Sequoia Kingdom, the Duke of the Wolf can not lack the strong. And because of the extremely belligerent style of the Duke, the number of strong men is even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large units of Richard were left in the military camp outside the city. He only took a dozen of guards to follow the messenger into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering Deep Rock City, the bustling and noisy city of the city also attracted Richard’s attention. City Gate and Nancheng Square have a wide boulevard connection, enough for three carriages to run in parallel. As the team marched, there was a sudden hoof of hooves on the front, and more than a dozen cavalrymen came to the gate and rushed to the gate. The knights yelled all the way, letting the pedestrians in front avoid the vehicles. They are all wearing dark gray cavalry armor with a sly wolf head pattern on their chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the screams, the Duke’s entourage led the team to the side and drove the middle road. More than a dozen knights swept through the wind, went straight to the gates, and quickly went away. Although all the way to pedestrians and vehicles have made way, but the shoulders on the city road rubbed, there is always a speed of action, but the team of knights rushing at full speed, but did not ride a pedestrian to the pedestrian, showing a superb ride Surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha rides on the horse, looking at the figure of the knights, and the pupil shrinks slightly. These knights have more than eight levels of strength, riding skills exquisite not to say, everyone is exuding murderous, apparently all veterans through the real battlefield, rather than just know the rookie trained in the training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
