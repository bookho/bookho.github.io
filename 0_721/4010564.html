			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two regiments were defeated, there were five remaining elf troops In the early years, more than half of the casualties can cause any army to collapse, but in the world of Iskara, there is no morale. These fighters can fight each other and they can play their own battles. Force, but no morale, there is no outbreak, 茜 obviously does not adapt to the style of this army, and Richard is handy, the battle unit of the hen is this cold and precise machine-like style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Richard has only suffered more than a hundred casualties, most of which are walking shields, but Richard has no feeling of ease, but feels heavy. When the shield battles are exhausted, the Cavaliers lack the protection they deserve and will fall into the chaos of the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskara did not give them time to rest, the loud voice once again dominated the world and announced the beginning of the third wave of offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the four legions were dispatched at the same time, and the most striking contrast with the front was the hundreds of wizards floating above each legion. Seeing these mage At the first sight, Richard did not say anything, jumped from the war and pulled out the long knife moonlight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real hard fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he seems to have become two people, one is condescending, overlooking the entire battlefield, constantly issuing orders, leading the troops to impact the opponent's weakness, and another One is to constantly cut down the enemies that appear in front of them, but the enemies are endless. Richard even has an illusion that the chopping movements are becoming mechanically numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Richard is still full, he is like a sly miser, carefully calculating the use of every drop of magic, the moon shines, but mostly rely on The sharpness of his own is killing his opponent. Even so, Richard's magic is still slowly declining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien warrior with a blade flutters, and the long, sharp blade makes Richard think of the original creation of the nest, those fierce shapes, The strength is quite ordinary, the fast beast, against this kind of limb-shaped opponent, Richard does not need to think at all, the moonlight instinct stabbed before, cut the head of the alien warrior, then Richard bypassed this huge opponent I am not willing to consume physical strength to push it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding behind the alien figure is a four-armed mage. It didn't think that Richard would suddenly appear. The four arms were still waving and preparing for a spell. For such a gift, Richard naturally did not let go of the truth, the moonlight was light. When it blooms, it unloads its four arms. The arm is the tool of the four-armed wizard, and the dagger or the lumbosac can't stop it from casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha keeps moving forward, the third consciousness has only endless enemies in his eyes, as if he can never kill, I don’t know how long it took, and Richard cut down one. The strong-horned demon suddenly disappeared in front of him. Within ten meters, there was no enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and looked at the enemy with only a few stars. It was indeed a win. When he looked back, he saw that the soldiers behind him had already Less than 300 people, the blue-violet light flashed in sight, and the jumping pony tail appeared again. The sky was sweeping, and dozens of enemies were squatting. She was still in the wind, and her guns were like a rainbow. The audience was chasing the opponent, but she was empty behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard has forgotten the time of the battle. What you can remember is that the seven full-fledged regiments of Iskara have been eliminated, and the horizon at a distance. The black-pressed crowd finally had a gap, but the gap was too small and too small, like an apple that was bitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think about the number of enemies at all. It was a figure that would make people lose motivation when he thought of it. He just turned around and reorganized his remnants. We, then continue to sweep the remnants everywhere, each soldier on the opposite side is part of the Iscara power, can kill one is one, this time, Richard finally has time to look at the cockroach, then 瞳孔一凝There are a few more blood on his face, and more blood is flowing from her hairline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 has been injured, so Richard understands that the fourth wave of offensive is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Richard called out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t bother me to kill, what do you do for what you do." During the conversation, the sky in the hands of the cockroaches is dying, and a dozen or so masters in the air A little bit falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored the threat of swearing and said: "This wave of enemies, I am in front, give you a head start."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the whole body, I turned my head and looked at the enemy who was still black and pressed. I looked at the pony tail and said, "Well, let you enjoy yourself in front, but be careful, don't die before me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "No, I still want to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜Waving the gun, swept a few enemies and said, "Of course you have to go back. My tribe can leave you with such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are not many remnants on the battlefield. At this time, the voice of Iskara is ringing again. This time, he actually raised his hand first. After a round of applause, he said: "It’s wonderful, little guy, you gave me A very unexpected surprise. With this strength, the number of kills is six times that of the elf army. I can't do it myself. On this board, you are the best player I have ever met, etc. After you die, I will resurrect you again and let you be the head of my army. Under your authority, there will be a complete board!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Isakara’s “honour and favor”, Richard apparently did not accept the interest, but he asked Iscara about the authority of the army leader, the board is located Where is the problem, while stepping up to sweep the enemy on the battlefield, on the chessboard, the soldiers will fight forever until they are killed, but they will also be tired, only limited intelligence of the law, Richard is doing everything Opportunity delays time so that the mage who survives can recover a little mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskara answered the questions of Richard one by one, and explained it in great detail, so Richard understood that the so-called chessboard is a battlefield like this, every battlefield They are responsible for the tens of millions of crystal wall erosions around them. There are as many as 50 legions under the jurisdiction of Richard, and so on. As a price for Iscara, Richard can be immortal first: as long as Scala is not dead, he can not die, and Richard can choose a king to dominate in the plane he has attacked... Similar benefits, as many as dozens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides talked for ten minutes, and Iskara said: "The little guy, you are almost at rest, these times are a reward for your wonderful command, now The rest time is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of Iskara, his army was once again dispatched. This time the enemy was everywhere, and there were eight legions, nearly 300,000. Warriors, the flying wizards are intensive like the huge birds that migrate. Such a massive enemy is to let Richard cut one by one. I don’t know how long to cut. These enemies can drag down Richard. Tired can also burden him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard cut down the enemy in front of him and looked at the enemy who was flooding in the distance. He snorted and said, "It’s really enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked over and shouted: "How, I am afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said, "Of course not, just killing is a little trouble." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you waiting for? Of course, troubles should be resolved early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few moonlights, the blade smashed up and said, "Okay, then I will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜Nod: "Go, I Then came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha backhanded the moonlight, picked up a long gun from the ground, followed by a horse, turned over the horse, and spurred the ride Taking a small step, leisurely welcoming thousands of times to the already enemies, the surviving three hundred soldiers were listed as a frontal formation behind Richard, and then moved forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 Still standing in the same place, the green sky is light on the ground, and the unruly pony tail is flying in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview from the sky, the army of Iskara is like a black tide, pushing on the ground with sweeping momentum, and opposite the Kuroshio, Richarda A small army is like a boat, and it is on the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five hundred meters apart, Richard suddenly screamed and began to speed up. All the fighters and mages also accelerated. This small unit is like this. The momentum rushed to the army of Iskara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air rang out of the strange whistling, the breath of energy became extremely violent, before the two sides crashed, the magic of both sides arrived first, the continuation of the Iskras Exploding more than ten fireballs or frosty balls and flying hundreds of fighters, but numerous ice and fires completely drowned the small team of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent energy fills the frontiers in an instant, and even the powerful horns who are pioneers are subconsciously slowing down their steps, in their simple consciousness, No one can survive in such an attack. Just as they hesitated, a burning knight rushed out of the raging flames and slammed into the front of the strong-horned demon. The horns lived and flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
