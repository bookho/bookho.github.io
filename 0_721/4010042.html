After redeeming the coordinates of Noland, there is still a lot of divine grace, at least enough to choose a defective part of the 'reincarnation' suit, or to redeem a heavenly guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the immediate situation, Liusha knows that the most important thing he should choose is to increase the level of magic. The remaining gods can at least lift the flow sand to two levels. At that time, the mirror of her time could threaten the sanctuary of the 18th level. This is the standard of Noland, and it is the township powerhouse on the 18th level of Faro. Since it is known as the town of the country, the number must be pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is lonely now, she doesn’t want to act according to reason, but wants to leave a commemoration for the turning point of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God give. Lucky grace!" The quicksand spit out the word, and in the heart recalled some of the fragments of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky Grace is a special kind of God-given, belonging to the category of equipment, but the equipment that is formed depends on the specific circumstances of God's goal, and changes are impermanent. The same person, even if the difference between the morning sacrifice and the afternoon sacrifice, the equipment obtained may be different. But one thing is constant. The equipment formed by Lucky Grace will be of great help to the goal of God's grace, perhaps now, maybe later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand points the goal of Lucky Grace to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining forces of time come together, and after a moment they turn into a dark gold magic pen, gently falling in the hands of the sand. Looking at this magic pen that is already an artifact level, the heart of the sand drifts gently. This is indeed the best gift for Richard and the best souvenir for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All divine grace has been consumed, and the book of time is slowly closed. Not far from the dragon's glory is a lot dim, but it is enough to start a minimum level of sacrifice, to get a little grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands took up the book of time and walked out of the room to find out that it was already dinner time. This dinner, at the request of quicksand, only Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything to say to me?" Richard looked at the sand and smiled a little. He can still have a lasting aftertaste of that big battle. In retrospect, Richard had some expectations and was even more afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a gift for you." Flowing sand handed over a rather delicate box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gift?" Richard took the wooden box with doubt and expectation, opened it, and immediately held his breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artifact! Definitely an artifact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard saw from the magic pen that he would never wear, never left, and had three incredible attributes. Moreover, the structure and center of gravity of the pruning pen are perfect. Such a magic pen is a treasure that all the builders have dreamed of. With it in hand, Richard's level of construction will jump directly to a step. The success rate and the addition width of the drawn structure will increase accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked up at the sand, and the sound was a little trembling, asking: "Where did this magic pen come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand raised his eyebrows and smiled and said: "I still have some gods not used up. I saw that there is something in the alternative, so I took it out. The consumption of God is completely negligible, so is it not? Isn't this magic pen good enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! It's great, it's all artifact level!" Richard said solemnly. He felt a little strange, and the identification ability of the sand drifting did not seem so bad. Could it be that the eternal and time dragons did not look at the builders, so they set the core equipment of a builder to be so cheap? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand shrug and say: "Artifact? Good! At least no waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then she deliberately opened the topic and talked about her own makeup. As soon as he talked about the construction, Richard immediately became stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core idea of ​​the 'King of glory' set has been established, and now three designs have been initially conceived. And this set will be made up of six pieces! For the construction of the flowing sand, Richard is rather lacking. If the glory of the secret can be completely designed, then the overall effect is even stronger than the nighttime breathing of the splash, although it is a second-and-half-order configuration, it completely meets the level of the second-order package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha thought for a moment and said: "Li Cha, the glory of the secret is too complicated, I think it can be put first. Now it is best to make a set immediately. It doesn't need the level of glory and night breathing, it doesn't matter if it's a little worse, as long as it's a suit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha asks: "To whom? The suit made?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a key issue, and the material basis of the target determines the design of the suit. However, Liu Sha said: "Not necessarily who, as long as it is a suit. Or you should design a suit-based knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Set-based knights? This idea is too extravagant and too impractical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and asked, "Why should you design such a suit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Because of it, after returning to Noland, you can hold a construction conference. When each builder officially becomes famous, there will be a decoration conference. I think the general assembly market will More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sharply captured a vital message: "Back...Noland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand rubbed his eyes and said, "Yes! We can go back in time. I promised you, there will be a way to go back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there already a coordinate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand understatement: "The sacrifice of the pile of keel ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what about Palin's disease? The Duke of the Wolf is likely to see something. His perception is very powerful." Frown said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't have to worry, the dragon will bring enough grace. Just pick it up and condense a few drops of life dew to him. The effect of life dew Obviously, the beneficiary will have a clear feeling. And if we cure Palin once, maybe the Duke will turn his face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also felt that the sand was very reasonable, so he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, the Duke of the Wolf arrived at the Blue Water Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the hotel, the Duke smiled and walked to Richard, and embraced him enthusiastically, then said: "The guys in the White Rock Principality are very difficult, but still I knocked back. Now I think I am a little scared! Oh, how about the dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very useful!" Richard said affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good! That's good!" The Duke of the Wolf understands that it is another meaning. He is so excited that he picks up his hands again and then calls in a pro. The soldier's attire, closed the door, said to the soldier: "Peilin! Your disease has hopes to solve, and don't thank you Sir Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the pro-inspector was actually Palin. After a very clever disguise, he changed his appearance and even changed his body shape. Even Richard did not recognize it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aging problem that has plagued him for many years can be solved, and Palin is naturally very excited. He hopes to have a longer life to complete his research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts his hand and says seriously: "The Duke, strictly speaking, the effect that the dragon can produce is mostly relieved, not completely Solve the aging problem in Palin. You should be aware that Palin's symptoms are actually the gods' punishment. If you want to completely remove it, the price is very huge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It is enough to ease," the Duke said immediately. For many years, he was helpless with Palin's illness, and he saw that Palin would run out of life. At this critical moment, even if only a straw suddenly appeared, he must firmly grasp it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and patted Palin’s shoulder to prepare for the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ceremony is simple and simple, with no lengthy prayers and cumbersome rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the temporary altar has been arranged, and the dragons are piled up in front of the altar. The auxiliary sacrifice ceremony was Clark and three junior priests. When he saw Clark, the Duke of the Wolf showed an unexpected look and gave him a deep look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a former great priest, Clark is also quite famous. After he was expelled from the Temple of the God of War, it was a miracle to re-cultivate the level of the 11th level as a unbelievers. However, at this time, in the eyes of the Duke of the Wolf, Clark not only recovered to the thirteenth level, but also the power of his body, apparently moving closer to the fourteenth level. In a short period of time, a 14-level grand priest can be created. There is only one explanation, which shows that the eternal and timeless dragons are indeed infinite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Duke’s confidence is a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand hand is placed on the book of time, the overflowing power envelopes all the dragons, and extracts a little golden light from the inside, with the power of time Gather together. The dragonfly is then grayed out and then scattered into a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the book of Time, the power of the separated time condenses into a small hourglass, which is even smaller than a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hint of joy on the sand surface, saying to Palin: "The dragon of eternal and time responds to your piety and gives you grace. Come, Pei Lin, put your hand on it, remember to always praise the great eternal and time dragon in your heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
