			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal’s double eyebrows are tighter, but Lawrence knows this time. Persuasion must be a futile process, just like it was a few decades ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence turned to look at Hastings and said coldly: "You must have the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master has a somewhat abnormal smile, saying: "Of course, I don’t know what I am, this little guy may have a blood relationship with the shackles, you Say, how can I let him go, for him, I can pay any price, ah, I will let this demon enjoy the deepest and longest suffering in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp Lawrence vaguely knows some of the reasons why Richard is so arguing that he wants to make a final effort to make Hestin try to prevent it from suffering too much when he studies black scorpion, and then let it go early. It died, but Hasting's last sentence blocked all his words back to his chest, and for a moment he was so sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence nodded and sneered, "Oh, well, I know that I have nothing to say now, but I still want to remind you about the expropriation." Next time, it is best not to use it on Richard. Long De Steader, your so-called overall situation is just your own overall situation. Even if you can not put a builder in your eyes, don’t think that he is You can arbitrarily oppress the object, in addition, Hastings, you better not forget who the teacher of Richard is, the temper of His Highness will only be worse than you, if she is determined to kill you, which position do you hide? It’s useless to go, so even if you can torture the little devil for a longer period of time, it’s best not to do anything on the water.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The smile on Hasting's face was slightly stiff, and then continued to smile indifferently, but the smile seemed to be a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence ignored the two and strode away from the hall of the proceedings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the residence of the city defense area, Lawrence couldn’t help but glance at the small courtyard next to him. Richard has returned to his place of residence and is sitting in the courtyard wiping Three long knives, from time to time will be a knife or two strokes, let the old man accidentally, Richard actually did not drink, no drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Richard made Lawrence worry more. The former sect of the sects greeted him and just wanted to persuade him, but then he opened his head. Richard did not raise his head and said: "The old man, no need. Worried, I have nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still okay, Lawrence rolled his eyes, but he is familiar with Richard’s temperament, knowing that he actually Long De Steader is equally stubborn, maybe the little devil has nothing to do in Richard's mind, but after this twist, it will become a thorn buried in the heart of Richard, and it will sting a few times. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence knew that he couldn’t persuade anything, and had to go to his own courtyard. At this moment, Richard stopped him and said, "Old man, wait a minute, I took something to exchange two top prizes with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee returned to the room, grabbed two large pockets and went to Lawrence here, When the pocket is thrown freely on the ground, he says, "For these things, change your two sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not look, Lawrence knows the pocket These are the large and small sacrifices made by Richard during this period of time, and the materials collected from the Dakso Das people. There are a lot of kills, although many times there is no time to harvest the decomposition materials, but The amount accumulated is still very impressive, at least equivalent to two and a half or even three top sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, here is not to calculate the value of the sacrifice materials in detail, Lawrence does not look at what is in the two pockets, turn back into Inside the house, after a moment, two pieces of fist-sized, gray-splitting ore were thrown to Richard, and Richard took over the ore and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short while, Richard reappeared at the gate of the courtyard. Behind him, the girl was just as a child who was doing something wrong, and some of them cringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, Richard sat down, sighed and sighed his forehead, showing some exhaustion, and the water was still standing against the wall, despite Richard pointed to the seat next to her to sit down, but she still stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at this time, Richard has resumed the connection with the soul of the splash, the contact was suddenly interrupted because Hastings completed the first phase of treatment, started The power of the magical array tolerate the soul of the water flower, so that her soul can be fully rested and nourished, and naturally cut off all the connections of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you suddenly come to the dusk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of Richard’s tone is unexpectedly peaceful, just like a girl is just a trivial little thing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hesitated for a moment and finally chose to tell the truth: "I... I want to follow you, but you don't let me, then someone knows what I think, then Help me, I am here, it is very suitable for me, I feel, I am getting more and more powerful, master, I... is your soul guard, should be with you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone." Richard was still calm, even faintly smiling, but the girl began to feel uneasy and quietly looked at her distance from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to ask: "How can I not feel connected with your soul, and it is not for you to help you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is her, and Io, Io felt that my mood was not very good during that time. I asked a few times, I didn’t know how to say it, then he I said, I should come over to find you, at least first to adapt to the battlefield of the extremity. As for the connection between the souls, Iowa has found Naiyou, and she shielded the soul guardian contract, and this shield also increases the soul. The ability to protect, while Iowa added a lot of divine power to the protection of Naiyou for a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: "So you are the one who helped Iowa and Naiyou, other people know, sand, Gangde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl shook her head:" I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite possible. In Faro, most of Richard’s followers act independently and often have a long time between each other. Not linked to the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you coming here, what is it for?" Richard asked again, and the reason given by the girl was not enough to convince him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s sight was nailed to the floor and said in a constant tone: “I am your soul guard, you have to keep up with your steps, I already It’s been a year since the end of the battlefield.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You...” Richard was a little dumbfounded, but the girl stood there, naturally. A heavy, quietly pressed on Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood up, turned two laps in the room, and then stopped in front of the shelf where the food was placed. He took out a bacon and skillfully cut it and began preparing dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cuts the meat and says: "Your injury is just right, do nothing today or tomorrow, take a rest first, if you take part in the battle during this time, then Don't leave this block. Remember, this is the order. When I re-adjust the structure on your body, we will find a way to go further and fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua nodded lightly, like a wolf with a fang in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, the clock of the magic clock faithfully points to the half of the disk that belongs to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the day is not without night, the radiant light of the time has consistently illuminated the entire fortress, protecting the people in the fortress, and It is a great burden and pressure for the enemy who wants to sneak into the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li lying in bed, now should be sleeping time, but he looked up at the ceiling, but could not sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has passed without knowing it, Richard has been growing at a rapid rate, and his followers are the same. Everyone has begun to have their own ideas and opinions. They also have the ability to put some of these ideas into practice. Just like the behaviors of Shuihua, Io, and Naiyou, those followers are no longer the oysters of the past, but gradually become able to stand alone or fight. The power is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s heart, how can Richard not understand, but has always chosen to ignore it, but now she has caught up with the field, but she chose this A dangerous way, under the protection of Nai's soul, the girl may not know until she is dead, and Richard will not know where she is actually close by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that she has always been a simple person, so simple to think of how to do it, the girl privately came to the battlefield, just like She said that she only wanted to be closer to Richard. This is a very simple girl, but in Richard’s heart, it is heavy because of its simplicity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, the young devil seems to be still in the shadow, observing Richard with fear and curiosity, but Richard’s true talent is Tell him that the young devil is no longer here. At this time, Hastings has already begun his own research work, and the suffering of the black scorpion has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
