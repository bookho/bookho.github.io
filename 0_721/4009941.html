The girl's water flower quickly crossed the Gangde. In the chaotic situation, the structure made her speed even higher, and she went to Sinclair, only a line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three stepping knights were knocked and chopped in front of Richard, and the bloodshot quickly spread in the eyes of Richard, and the intense anger and fear were intertwined. Let him tremble all over the body. However, his movements were still stable and accurate. The pages of the books that had been prepared for the time were taken out and displayed. The rich death atmosphere spread instantly, and the obstacles in front of Sinclair added another tall and mighty black warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A loud bang, Hinckler once again slammed the black warrior, but failed to hit a hundred kilograms of black warriors. Her left-handed short knife was inserted into the gap between the black warrior's neck armor, and the black warrior's head was cut off with a force. The black warrior was completely scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, there is no longer any obstacle between Sinclair and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smirked, grinds her teeth, resists the pain and discomfort of her body, and raises her right hand long knife. In less than half a second, Hinckler will slash no less than 30 knives and cut Richard into pieces that are difficult to count. She will keep Richard's head, heart and **, the three most valuable parts she thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the knife first explores the arm of Richard, and the magician has a keen sense that he can clearly feel what Sinclair has done in this area. Sinclair prepared a full fiveteen knives in this position, and she is convinced that this will give Richard a very deep memory of sudden death. And she also believes that the more fear a person has before his death, the more delicious his heart is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what she saw was not a panicked teenager, but a man who calmly pulled out his sword and gradually zoomed in and out. The round of scarlet string on his head was particularly glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already raised the nameless knife, and the power of the wild is constantly boiling from the blood. The power of the explosion is mixed with the moon of the moon, and it is sacred. And the characteristics of the high and above are fully exerted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to bark, no roar, Richard is a simple sword to kneel down to Sinclair, the red moon is squirting out, in Li Look out for a new moon in the front. Borrowing the moon, the moon, the elf secret sword, the new moon, the power of the show in the hands of Richard is so amazing, so that Sinclair also had to lift the knife block. Otherwise, she has not completed the 'operation' of Richard, and Richard can break her off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is martial arts? The power of Noland's chords? How is it possible!" Sinclair screamed in a row, but the knife did not stop to Richard. Crazy attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the outburst and anger, Richard’s body is surging with the power of the cockroach, the head and the moon are changing, and the moon phase is getting clearer and clearer. . The elf's secret sword swayed out without thinking, and within the scope of the force of the crescent moon, all the actions of Sinclair were invisible, and they were forced to retreat by a critical strike by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ever-changing chords of the moon, Richard and Sinclair battled equally! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Richard has been burning like a boil, and the violent blood power is always accompanied by intense pain. The lava-like explosive force constantly destroys his nerves and body. However, Richard only needs to hold on to a short moment, and the surrounding companions will once again surround Sinclair. The devil girl who still burns the fire is no longer invisible. The power of the mirror of the sand drifting time also appeared at this time. Although Hinkeler forcibly crushed this magical technique, it was also hurt correspondingly, and the movement was slowed down by one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
