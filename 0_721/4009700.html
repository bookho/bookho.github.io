The ability to draw a complete magic pattern is the most important step in the life of the builder. As long as the degree of completion is more than 10%, it is only a matter of time to make a real magic pattern. It can be said that as long as this step is taken, it will definitely become a builder, even if it is only a constructor who can draw the primary magic lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is still young, and his most important thing is time. He thought that this work, which cost him a whole half-month of hard work and material processing, brought together the whole family power of Soram, and spent a total of more than one million gold coins before and after, would completely conquer Phil Master, but I did not expect it to be this. result. If this piece is handed to the hands of the architect Santa Cruz, it will inevitably receive the highest degree of praise and praise. However, the indifference and carelessness of Phil's Magisters poured a layer of ice water in the hot heart of Stevenson, or the ice water of the ice floes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is Luther? Stevenson knows that Luther is a student of Phil Master, 31-year-old, 13-level great magician, with no special blood, matching age and magic, and that's all. Such a person will not be able to put Stefanson in his heart even in the dark blue. And the work that he worked hard to complete was thrown to his students by the Phil Magister, and let such a waste that can only be regarded as a moderate to guide himself? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair’s attitude is the same, then the reaction of His Royal Highness is more imaginable. Stevenson was suddenly disheartened, and he was even more stunned by the empty income items on his bill for several months. Is it so difficult to get the joy of the legendary mage? Which part of the problem is wrong? You know, even if you don't mention Richard, Randolph's waste has been the joy of a number of legendary wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidison is not the money, all he needs is the recognition and inheritance of the legendary mage. And ‘Su Helun’s joy’, as the name of the project shows, is the most intuitive representation of her attitude. If even ‘Su Helun’s joy’ is not available, how can it be qualified to pass on the architect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been in the dark blue for more than half a year. During this time, Stevenson asked himself that there was no slack. He carefully prepared for each meeting with the legendary mage to show his perfect side. Some meetings were listed on the calendar, and some encounters were created with a lot of manpower and resources. And he spends more time on magical learning and cultivation than ever before, and the speed of magic growth bears witness to his efforts. He did a lot of things to do, and he did a lot of things that he shouldn't do but he thought it was necessary. For example, Richard, who spared no effort and unscrupulously attacked the biggest competitor, was recognized by the legendary Master as the "future sect of the future." Unfortunately, Richard was closed like a stone, making him almost incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every occasion, Stevenson maintains the etiquette and demeanor of the most decent big aristocratic children, even if he sometimes wants to lick the other’s nose. Broken, or tear the other's bra. He has clearly understood the architecture of the deep blue, understands the mode of operation, knows the temper, habits and hobbies of every important person, and successfully draws a group of friends and isolates his enemies. Only the last point is somewhat questionable, because Richard has always been lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after an unprecedented effort, Stevenson has also gained an unprecedented loss. The indifference of Phil's Magister's mentor made him wake up at this moment. Deep blue is a huge and unmatched monster. He just thought that he knew it well, but he didn't even see it. In the presence of a large collection of large magisters, the 17-year-old Dragon Warlock is nothing at all, even if he claims to be a genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue, the most lacking is the genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A student at Phil also stayed in the lab to clean up the venue. Seeing Stevenson's pale and awkward face, he suddenly felt that he couldn't bear it, not to mention that he had received a lot of small gifts from Stevenson. Although it is not very rare, it represents the memory and mind, especially for the children of the great aristocrats of Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He greeted Stevenson and then looked at the left and right, only to suppress the voice, said: "The teacher is very busy today because of the morning Lee The inspection submitted a magical structure. So the teacher used to test the effect of the magic pattern all morning, and the timetable was disrupted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The student's voice is light, but the words inside are blasting like a thunder in the ears of Stevenson, shaking him almost standing unsteadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha? Magic pattern? What is the construction, what is the degree of completion?" Stevenson asked with a last hope. His voice suddenly hoarse, and the hair that was originally deliberately made a messy hair was really messy. The hair of the forehead was soaked by sweat and pressed tightly on the forehead. But he knows very well that the magic pattern that can be used to test the effect will be far more complete than his 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students looked at Stefanson sympathetically and pointed to the body of the armored horse that was being towed away by Lux in the distance. Agile', completion... It doesn't make sense. See the iron armor, the structure has been made into a plug-in, and it is installed on it. The experiment is very successful, indicating that the assembly plug-in only needs one A little bit of perfection will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is psychological preparation, the answer is far beyond Stevenson’s expectations. The magic pattern has been made into a plug-in, and the test is successful? This is the second level that will be encountered on the way to the builder, which is to insert the finished magic pattern into a specific creature. And Richard easily crossed the level, which means that Stevenson is very clear. According to the most relaxed standards, Richard can now use the title of the builder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news defeated Stevenson’s psychological bottom line in one fell swoop, although the current Richard’s distance can really create a knight’s constructor. A long way to go, but the road ahead of Stevenson is much longer! Richard is only twelve years old, even if he is one year old, he is only thirteen years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s eyes are suddenly black, all hopes, all futures, all honors and glory, as if at this moment, the family is The huge investment in him has always been cold and heavy. Randolph’s next Stevenson has seen it and ridiculed it proudly. But soon, Randolph's today may become his tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson grabbed the student's hand, because the force was too strong, the nails were deeply caught in the other's flesh. He whispered in a hoarse voice: "Are you sure that Richard? Richard Akmond? The little guy who is not thirteen years old?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The students quietly broke the hands of Stevenson. He understands the feelings of Stevenson at this moment and understands his gaffe more. Little Richard gave everyone a huge shock, even Phil's Magister can't keep calm, let alone Stevenson? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habit of the legendary mage has long been an open secret, so students in the same field have always been competing with each other or even trampling on. Every progress of Richard means the joy of the big boss for the teachers who teach him, but it is a heavy blow to the other students of the boss. And Richard’s achievements are so dazzling, the student can’t even bear to imagine how heavy the shock that Stevenson has been subjected to. In fact, I don't have to imagine it. I only know that the dragon sorcerer who has never lost his mind has been stunned at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the small pain caught on the arm, the students are not on the mind. The little gift that Stevenson gave was enough to make up for this pain dozens of times more than enough. At this moment, I saw this young, eye-catching, genius, and also the dragon-wound warlock who plundered many beautiful girls and bodies. His heart will be oily and sorrowful. Just like the words that Su Hailun’s Highness often hangs on his lips, “I really can’t help but laugh!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, and the reticent Richard Twenty, Stevenson’s light is dazzling too much. If he is planted in the mud, he will be too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students certainly don’t really laugh out, but look at Stevenson with a deep understanding of compassion, nothing to say, just point Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For people like Stevenson who are the core of the world around them, the last thing they need is sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sympathy of the students is even more uncomfortable than taking a few slaps on the spot, but Stevenson can’t attack, only to reluctantly return to a good-hearted smile. However, his face was as hot as a fire, and all the blood came up, and the pale skin showed a strange flush. For the role and effect of sympathy, the student is equally clear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the effect is achieved, the student is not prepared to stay any longer, staying for a while, he is afraid that he will really couldn’t help but laugh. Only Su Hailun has no scruples in the dark blue, so he can laugh with impunity. When everyone except her wants to laugh, look at the time and place and the people around. Before leaving, the student suddenly remembered one thing, so he looked around again and quietly stuffed a piece of burnt skin into the hands of Stevenson. And Stevenson was not eager to see what he got, but took out a small crystal bottle and gave it to the students as a gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful magic recovery agent, although it is a small bottle, but the market price is more than 500 gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very satisfying gift! And it’s just a reward for the news that the students have revealed. I believe that the people who understand this in Devinson will definitely make more representations about the things that he has given him. The student carefully collected the small crystal bottle, and the bottle's cool, smooth and delicate touch made him reluctant to leave his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students, today is a rewarding day. He witnessed the birth of the miracle, harvested a valuable 'small gift', and more ‘small gifts’ on the way, and enjoyed the mood. Can't expect more! Before stepping into the transmission magic circle, the students couldn't help but look up at the sky in the ice floes and felt that the weather was really good today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson also looked up at the sky, where the sights were covered, and it was the harbinger of the coming blizzard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the large stand near the experimental field, there were only two people, Stevenson and Minnie. Minnie stayed next to the magical array. When the Luxs cleared the armored horses in the field, they approached the guardrail there and took a few steps and observed them carefully. In addition, whether Stevenson and Phil talked, or talked to the master's students, she did not approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This damn weather!" Stevenson couldn't help but curse. The early spring of the ice floes is still extremely cold, and the cold wind blows on the clothes soaked in sweat, making Stevenson feel like falling into the ice. He opened his hand and looked at what the student had stuffed him, his face immediately became more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a semi-coke skin, the material is obviously taken from a subspecies of some kind of lizard, from the grade level and the flames are at least four A large grade, and the market price per unit area is more than 1,500 times. Stevenson was very clever, and naturally he immediately responded to the intention of the student to give him the piece of broken skin. The primary agility of Richard is drawn on such a barely qualified material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
