			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard stepped out of the portal, the dragon in the air took the law Luo said: "Human, I have been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is both unexpected and somewhat unexpected, the reason for the valley defense accidental relaxation It is here, although Richard has been psychologically prepared, he is still a little surprised. He raised his head and said with the dragon four eyes: "It turns out to be a real dragon, or predicts the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The dragon replied proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the dragons who were waiting for the sudden, and suddenly smiled and asked: "So many people, not to welcome me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The coordinates of this plane cannot be taken away." The dragon replied, "The intruder can only stay here forever."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intruder, Li smiled and said: "Prophecy is not a panacea, you know where you are wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wrong." The dragon roared angrily, and the voice roared like a thunder: "Under the guidance of the glory of my master Tiamat, we, the noble prophecy of the dragon, may make mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard suddenly became very weird and asked: "Who are you talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant Long Tia Matt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil Dragon Tiamat." Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the sinister dragon god Tiammat, mortal, you must remain awe." The dragon in the air roared, apparently very dissatisfied with Richard's attitude. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the five-color dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the sacred dragon god, mortal,. "The dragon in the air is already furious. "You can't call it like you. You are too humble. Even if you just call the title of your Majesty, it is already awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the dragon in the air, Richard looked at the edges of the scales with golden lines. It looked elegant and mysterious. It was more than 50 meters long and lived at least two or three hundred years from the top of the dragon's annual ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dragon family, this age can only be regarded as a young man, but the dragon with the prophetic talent is always in a high position in the family, from this dragon The arrogant attitude can also be seen, this dragon is only the power of the 20th level, counting the racial talent bonus, it is just the legendary level of combat power, in front of the same level of Richard, single In terms of grade, there is no obvious advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard thinks of prophecy, whether it is magic or talent, the basic principles are as long as the time goes by, so that you can peek into the front part, they can see It was nothing more than a still scene, just like the pictures that Richard had seen during the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to see more, and may see what you care about the most, but the ability to weak can only see some messy Random screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prophecy is based on the dragon, and there is no defense and warning system on the other end. Obviously, he is extremely confident in his ability to predict the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the prophetic ability has one of the most deadly weaknesses. If the other party is strong enough, the effect will be greatly reduced. Obviously, the dragon successfully saw the passing of the Richards. The future of this portal is not able to perceive the strength and danger of this human being, but the dragons are arrogant. In their eyes, mortals are ants that can be swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled at the dragon in the air and said, "You haven't seen Tiamatt for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How noble is the character of the evil dragon god, where is easy to see." The dragon looked dismissive of Richard's problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dragon’s heart is also strange. It found the high-level defensive magic fluctuations when Richard stepped out of the portal, and the human beings were really blind. The race, but after waiting for so long, the magic has not yet expired, and there is no attempt or action by Richard to make up the magic, so that it can not send out the instructions of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard is basically able to confirm the evil dragon god Tiamat in his mouth, most of which is the evil that was locked in the half-face of Su Hailun at the moment. Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the five-color dragon is still above the evil dragon. It is also the nominal owner of Tiamat. If she and Su Helun meet in the outer space, it may be unpredictable, but Noland can be more than a strong person in Su Helun. If the five-color dragon dares to be close to Noland, maybe some ancient strongmen will show up, in order to kneel down on this legendary female dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and said, "Tiamat is dead, look at what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a transparent test tube from his arms, and there was a drop of deep purple dragon blood floating in it. If the dragon blood had its own life, it would continue to move back and forth in the test tube, looking for a way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the seam with a cover and immediately buckled him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a breath of breath that has caused the dragon in the air to roar in horror: “This is the blood of Tiamat’s adult, mortal How can you have this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled, did not answer the question of the dragon, and his hands quickly outlined one magic symbol after another, instantly condensing in the air A magical array, the surrounding energy is instantly inhaled by the magic array, gathering into an energy vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha entered the magical array, standing in the center of the squad, and began to have a fireball between his hands, revealing the fireball of the blue ** Ze in one second. The speed is directed at the surrounding dragons. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the first wave of dragons trying to prevent Richard from launching magic attacks is okay, but the construction of the magic array before Richard is all silent And instant, all the interrupted and counter-manufactured spells were all lost, but the rushing comrades rushed into the fireball net, and immediately turned over, not to mention close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still tumbling in the roaring prophecy. The dragon also received his own gift: a pure blue fireball with an unusually fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this pure blue fireball, the dragon’s erectus can no longer see the other, and the incomparable danger of intuition makes it the dragon scale in the neck. All pieces are erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon doesn’t know why this fireball is blue, but the intuition warns it is best not to touch it on the body, predicting the dragon’s horror, the wings Vibrate, straight up to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the fireball turned a corner in the air and chased the prophet dragon. The dragon did not care for the dragon dragons below, and hurriedly dropped a dragon language defense magic, no matter where it fell, Headlessly desperately flies to the sky, any magic has a range, as long as it flies out of the range of the tracking fireball, it is safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to the prophecy dragon that was fleeing in the sky, but did not stop the fireball and continued to blast to the surrounding dragons, this time Richard The blood circulation was enabled, and more than ten fireballs were fired in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball exploded one after another, and the burning fire continued to reverberate among the dragons, bringing down a large number of dragons, but there were also strong among the dragons. The counter-attacks of bows and arrows have come, bombarded on the protective cover of Richard, the powerful energy is stirred, and the protective cover is violently fluctuated in a blink of an eye. However, these attacks also exposed the position of the strong among the ordinary believers. Richard’s casting speed suddenly increased. This time, there is no difference in the overwhelming fireball. The attack, only shot three pure blue fireballs, and then instantly retreated, turned into the plane transfer door, and withdrew Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophecy in the sky is that the dragon is not easy to get rid of the pure blue fireball tracking. At the height of 10,000 meters, the energy control reaches the limit of the fireball, and the air bursts and splashes. The blue fire drops make the dragons that are not far away from the clouds look scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just swooped down and saw that the three capable men were wrapped in blue fire all over the body, and they were burned to fly ash in an instant, even screaming There are no opportunities, there is more fire everywhere on the ground, and the dragons have suffered heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy of the dragon looks at it, at least one-third of the people are lost. These dragons are their direct men, this short battle makes Its power has been greatly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predicting the dragon is angry and roaring, but I was just scared by Richard’s fireball, and I don’t know the situation at the end of the portal, let it learn Seeing alone through the portal to chase, that is to say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but predicting that the dragon himself did not dare to go, but he pointed to a dragon dragon and said: "You, go see the portal now. What is the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
