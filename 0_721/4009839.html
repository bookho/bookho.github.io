			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in Gangde’s view, the scrolls that cannot be used are similar to the waste paper. If you don’t want to leave it to the enemy, it’s easiest to burn. Because the time for truly cleaning the battlefield is only ten minutes, there are countless things in the temple. It is impossible to clean up and take away all. For example, the god of courage is embedded with many golden gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter in the hands of Essien can be said to be worthless, but unfortunately, in order to withstand the power of the powerful bombs of Richard’s powerless bombing, it is estimated that Essien's magic is also the largest increase through the scepter, so the white crystal has been completely turned into ashes, and even the scepter itself is distorted. However, this scepter, which is made of gold, fine gold and a small amount of black-crystal iron, is worth tens of thousands of coins for the rest of the material that can be recycled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Blue's learning career has made Richard a master in the field of magical materials, and naturally knows how much this harvest is. Robbery and looting do have unparalleled advantages in the early stages of wealth accumulation. Although it is a bloody capital, it is undoubtedly the fastest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another special harvest is a diary found in the room of the priest Essien. This thick diary light is half the thickness of the upper and lower cover, and the entangled buckle is attached with a complicated magic lock. If the crack fails, the violent energy in the magic lock will immediately destroy the diary into gray. Only from such a strict protection, it is known that the content recorded in this diary is very important. The experience of a true priest is very precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to bring this diary back first. As for the magic lock, it is essentially a magical array. As long as it is a magical array, it is not too difficult for Richard, especially the magical array of the secondary plane. He looked at his eyes casually and knew that cracking was not a problem, it was just a matter of time. Although he does not understand the magic language and symbols of this plane, the high similarity with the Noland plane means a high degree of similarity between the world structure and the rules, especially this is a working and well-defined magic array, rules Nothing more than that, the same way. It's a good idea to go back and do it later, maybe you can parse some rules a little, so that he can accurately use the magic material of this plane to make the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha re-launched, and some regrettedly glanced at the baron castle still closed behind, and it was a pity that he felt sorry. The Baron Fossa didn’t know whether she was smart or simple, but she couldn’t help but couldn’t stop it. Richard, who was ready to make an ambush on the way, lost a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without ignoring the castle’s own defense facilities, the Baron Fossa is at least a team of dozens of elite guards, and the loss of the storm is certainly not light, and Richard now The biggest problem is that you can't afford even the smallest attrition. If you are dead, it’s just a matter of reducing your troops. If you lose even a stepping knight, you can’t make up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you have a drawing of the Baron Castle on your hand, but you want to play the second hard battle, you have to wait until the sand is full of power. Now not only Richard, but the guys who rushed to the front line are even more inseparable from her. If the sand does not stand behind, they feel awkward when they rush. But now the sand has accidentally consumed most of the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A priest like a sand drifter often means an extra life on the battlefield. And Richard’s support for the moral morale of the people is not only in the powerful attack of firepower, but also in his control of the battlefield. As long as Richard is in the air, the sand that has been closely following the action of Richard can guarantee that it will appear at the most critical moment, the most crucial place. From this point of view, Richard's role is no less than sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at the direction of the garrison barracks. There was no darkness in the darkness. If it wasn’t long before, I knew that the big house in that direction was a barracks. I really couldn’t see any difference from ordinary dwellings in this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at the beginning of the battle, there were several garrison probes who came to scout and scouted. After being killed by Oral, there were no more successors. It seems that the captive knight who is the garrison of the garrison is also a wise man. If he is held accountless, if he is pursued, he will lose the land at most, and he will always lose his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the shrine that had been completely swallowed up by the flames, and there was no regret in his heart. Tonight's battle was as big as he expected, and the process was almost the same as he expected. It’s just that the results are a bit unsatisfactory. Apart from the wealth that I have won, other aspects are not good. Essien's priest escaped. The baron even had no loss for a sealed knight. The destruction of the Knights of the Temple was not a big deal, but it was a bit damaged. Moreover, the core of the war should be to clear the other high-level professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Richard put down his regret, waved his arm and ran towards the gate with the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates are still open, and the barriers that have been removed are completely maintained. The bodies of the garrisons that fell in the pool of blood are not in charge. The battalion horses roared out, then two ogres and a group of fast beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long distance, Li looked back and the port city was still in full swing. At this distance, you can also see the film that swallowed the building. There is no sign of fire fighting in the open fire and the smoke. Fortunately, there are empty areas around the temple. Otherwise, if the fire spreads, it is possible to let half of the city be buried in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of the pages in his arms, and there was a hint of intuition. Perhaps this page is the most important harvest tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Li asked to post the long-prepared notice to the city's main road to the eye-catching place. The contents of these notices are exactly the same, that is, the family of the three dying jazzs of the Baron Fossa is informed that they are in their own hands, so that the Baron Fossa prepares 5000 gold coins to redeem the hostages. If the Baron Fossa does not pay the ransom within two days, then the families of these dying heroes will be sold to other places as slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requesting a ransom for prisoners of war or hostages is a common practice in aristocratic warfare. It is generally not a life-and-death vengeance. There are very few acts of massacre in war. Moreover, the amount of ransom proposed by Richard is not excessive, and it is entirely within reasonable limits. However, because of the god of courage, the Baron Fossa could not agree to this request. Richard also knows that the Baron will not compromise. What he wants to do is to make the Baron's decision widely known. There is a qualitative difference between the three jazz and a jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the port city, Richard scattered a few fast beasts and continued to patrol an area to prevent accidental pursuits and raids, including Detect traps and ambushes in the front, if any. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The route of the team is to take the road to the town of Jovan, and the two beasts quickly go out for a few kilometers to explore the road. Not only because this road is already familiar, but also to observe the movement of the troops in the town of Jovan. If the army dares to return to the rescue baron, then Richard does not mind another ambush. Those ordinary warriors rushed through the night, and certainly there was not much fighting power left. A quick shock could defeat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the sand is slowly recovering, and Richard has a dynamic structure, recovering much faster than the sand, and he feels faint, in consecutive fields After the fierce battle, his magic has loomed a sign of breakthrough, and soon he can become a nine-level wizard, able to learn and cast five levels of magic. These are the guarantees for the victory of the battle, and the confidence that Richard dared to launch another battle. It is a pity that the captive knight who led the standing army is also a cautious person. It is completely confined within the barracks. It seems that the idea is not to shine out of the barracks. From a distance, from the beginning of the road to the beginning of the military camp, there are visible roadblocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
