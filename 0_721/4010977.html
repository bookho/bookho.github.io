			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an incredible ability, and Richard is equivalent to being in the dark. Walking once, this experience is completely priceless, and how to describe its preciousness is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Martin and nodded slowly. The pope did not say much, muttered a few words, and then reached out to Richard's forehead and gently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard was completely in the dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't see anything, can't hear anything, and all perceptions will be completely distorted once they are exposed. The feeling of coming back is completely distorted, and the broken things can't be combined to make any sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, what Richard saw was darkness, and the next moment became a colorful light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he saw it and felt it. But now the underlying rules of the world have changed. What he sees is just a myriad of pieces, and then piled up in disorder, and there is no way to tell what it is. The more Richard is working hard, the more he can't grasp the clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie suppressed the panic in his heart and knew that he had entered a completely different world. Everything in this world is beyond his understanding. For example, the sound here may be color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, this is a completely different place from the world where eternal and timeless dragons shine. And as a matter of urgency, Richard is first to rebuild the perception and understanding of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard calms down and activates real talent. This time, in his vision, there was finally a line of rules, life and death, and many rules of the line singularly intertwined, like a messy clew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately understood the essence of the world, that is, darkness and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the essential understanding, Richard began to try to resolve these rules, but suddenly found that the wisdom of talent completely lost its role. He thought about it and realized that in this new world, the original analytical model is no longer useful, and the analytical method needs to be rebuilt to fit the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard sank into the heart, and for the first time set up a parsing task for himself and started the speed calculation. This mission is not difficult, and Richard's wisdom talent has reached a very powerful eighth. So it didn't take long before the results were reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has re-adjusted his perception based on the new model, and suddenly there has been a completely strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven’t waited for Richard to see what the world is like. There’s a big, dry, big hand in front of him, and he’s caught him from this world. Come out. Richard’s eyes were suddenly a strange moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time Richard has understood what is going on, after switching his perception mode back to the order of Eternal and the Dragon of Time, Pope, Martin and The chapel once again appeared in the eyes of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s breath is a lot weaker, and his face is pale, as if he had just had a big fight. He clung to the box with the light and praise, and waved his hand tiredly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said to Richard: "Let's go first, there will be something to say later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard and Martin left the Cathedral of St. Hui and came to a small church at the other end of the kingdom, where Martin is now living. After two people sat down, Martin explained that Richard realized what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s experience in the dark is his greatest asset. Since returning from the darkness, the Pope has had a peculiar and terrifying ability to present his memory in the dark, and then pull others in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of the dark region are completely different from the order established by the eternal and the dragon of time, where even perception and thinking are chaotic, so people are likely to always Can't adapt to the world. If the pope then closes this memory. Then the person who is sent to the memory may be trapped in it forever, and in fact is equal to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Pope’s most terrible ability, and the ability to have almost no solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin has always cared for his ability, because Martin knows that he is absolutely impossible to come out of the dark. Of course, the Pope’s ability is not without cost. Every time he performs it, the memory that is being transformed will disappear forever. According to St. Martin's observation, the Pope's memory in the dark area can only support him to cast three abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past years, the Pope has used this ability twice and solved two extremely powerful enemies. Now there is only one chance to use. Although there is only one chance left, one chance is enough for anyone, including St. Martin and Chinese, to be discouraged by the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin knows that he must die, and at most half of Chinese is still hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now this opportunity has been used in Richard, and the Pope’s toughest measures to balance Quint Martin and Chinese have disappeared. In the following period, perhaps the main opponent of St. Martin is the Archbishop of China. But even without the memory of the dark regions, the Pope still can't be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Martin’s explanation, Richard also understood some secrets inside the glory. And now he finally knows that the sands make him challenge the Pope's intentions. I thought that the sands would have known that the pope would probably send Richard into the darkness of the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard can survive, then naturally there is a qualification to travel to dark areas. If Richard is dead, then it is only a little earlier. It’s really dark, and Richard only died faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt that Richard is now is why the Pope would value the tribute to the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this question, Saint Martin laughed and did not answer. Richard then knew that this matter might involve the core secrets of the Church of Light and would no longer ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing these, Martin said: "Lee, the Pope promised to give you twice the price. This compensation will be converted into materials, I will send someone to you. In the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the painful slaughter of the Church, Richard would not have any embarrassment, and immediately nodded: "It is better to be strong. The material of the rule of power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin nodded and said, "Lee, the Pope asked me to bring this sentence to you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martins handed over a note, and Richard opened it and saw that there was a sentence in the text: "zì yóu is not without cost, the most heavy shackles mean The broadest world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not understand the meaning of this sentence, and Martin obviously did not intend to explain. Richard repeatedly meditated several times, remembered this sentence in his heart, and then told Martin to leave, ready to leave the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Martin stopped Richard and said, "Richard, you must be careful recently. I always feel that the power of fate is showing me jǐng, and the danger is coming to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at St. Martin and sighed: "Why is the danger coming to me, but is it that you have a feeling first? Is this something that can’t be said?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin reveals a smile and smiles sharply: "Because the fate of our two are getting closer and closer together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand that this is the opening remark that you want to kill me again?" Richard is not at all polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I killed you, isn't it a proof of staggering fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I There is no interest in intertwining your destiny! If you want to kill me, you can try it, now it will work, and you will do it later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin actually continues Nod: "Reassured, I will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him deeply and said, "I think I am here to give you the slaughter here. It would be a good idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin smiled brilliantly: "You can't kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, there is a dangerous blue sè, but the voice is very calm and said: "Try it or you will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I won't try it because you have a lot of troubles, such as "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin hasn't finished talking yet, and Richard's arms suddenly sounded a click! Richard suddenly changed his face and looked at Martin calmly. He stood up and said, "I have to go first. You remember that people sent the money of praise and praise."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, my credibility in this area has always been perfect. But what was the sound just now, what is it broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Martin, who was puzzled and curious, Richard just said, "You got it wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
