He is even less willing to experience this experience again. However, the nobles did not stop the celebration of the carnival, this time they heartily put the weapons they wore in the air. A precious magic weapon bursts into the sky with a splendid light, and the altitude is different. Then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting to fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was helpless, and immediately launched several groups of long-range attack protection to protect these over-exciting aristocrats. Fighting priests and quicksands are also busy adding magic to these nobles. Otherwise, there will always be a few unlucky ones that will be stabbed by weapons falling from the sky. This can be some high-end goods, once stabbed, the nobles of the nobles can not help. The aristocrats who can follow the march of Richard, all have martial arts in their bodies, and catching a falling weapon is just a piece of cake. In this era of strong and war-torn, the nobles are a bit real. Even the goods of Heim originated, and there were several imperial soldiers in their hands. However, in the chaos of the moment, something will happen but no one can say it. After all, those high-end goods flying in the air, with the attributes of the armor-breaking devil are not too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mess in the area, and the fire on the rock fort was frightened. He suddenly saw hundreds of people screaming in unison, and the sound of the waves completely overwhelmed his big tricks, followed by hundreds of weapons thrown into the sky, and the shining magical light almost brightened his eyes. He dared to swear with a beard, and he has never seen so many magic weapons in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s nervous, maybe it’s threatened, another dwarf on the top of the rock castle shakes his hands, and the squirt in his hand slams out The group caught the flame of black smoke and rolled over to the sky. The gunshots roared, the volume was several times larger than the dwarf's big tricks, and even overwhelmed the cheers of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was taken aback and then turned to surprise. Fire gun! This is one of the purposes of his coming to the Dwarf Empire. As for the power of the musket, it is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats behind him are much more responsive, and many people think they have been attacked, unconsciously pulling out their weapons, gathering their anger, and blessing themselves. Protective magic. A small part of the timid, even checking whether there is injury, whether it was hit by a musket. In fact, the nobles are a hundred meters away from the Rock Fort. Don't say that the muzzle of the dwarf's beard is pointing to the sky, aiming at the bombardment of the nobles and not hitting it so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the rock castle, the fire must be angry and snarled at the dwarf next to him: "Bronze whiskers! You guys useless, what to shoot!" Hey, my beard, what I saw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, behind the Richards and the nobles, the cavalry of the brigade began to appear, filling up in a blink of an eye. In the valley valley, there are countless soldiers in the back of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far, Richard heard a sound from the Rock Fort: "My beard! I bet there are at least three thousand enemies across!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock castle immediately sounded a messy voice, and from time to time there was a dwarf's unique thick voice yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand people? Hurry up the alarm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What three thousand people! At least Five thousand! They are still coming in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how many people, my black iron will smash their heads!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shouts, one's head and eyes are constantly shaking after the shooting hole . Every dwarf who saw the Richards's eyes would immediately round out, and then there was a huge muzzle in front of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and saw that the soldiers who entered the valley behind him were actually less than two thousand, but the forwards were all cavalry, so they seemed to be more. However, the dwarf has always been fond of spirits and likes to exaggerate. It is not surprising to say more. There are more than 10,000 troops in the outskirts of the valley. The rock fort is sturdy, and there are dozens of dwarves inside, which can be easily flattened. But Richard came here, not for war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every dwarf in the pale highlands is a precious asset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was alone and stopped until he was less than 50 meters away from Rock Fort. He yelled: "My name is Richard! Come here." It’s not for war, but for spirits and friends! Excuse me, is this the Thunder Hammer?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf in the rock castle is a messy discussion Finally, the fire on the top of the fort was called: "Thunder Hammers are not here, they are in the mountains three days southwest. Here is the land of the Furnace Tribe, the place where the great sons of the great Doro. Anvil live. Humanity, since you are coming for spirits and friends, why do you bring so many troops? But you have more people and you can't scare offspring of the anvil!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "We are from the far east, across the entire blood-stained land! You should know that the blood-stained land is full of robbers, slave traders and horses, if not Under the protection of these fighters, I will not come to the land of the dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire must hesitate Next, still loudly said: "Many of you humans are liar, I don't believe you! You have taken a lot of dwarves as slaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li does not mind The fire is rude, saying: "Not all people are liar. Your fellow family, the Thunder Hammer tribe has a very close cooperation with our human beings. Since the hammer is willing to believe in human beings, why can't the furnace be? And I I think that being a friend is good for both of us. Of course, if the furnace refuses to come from a friend who is coming from afar, we can also go to the hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire snorted and said: "How can the small tribe of Thunderbolt compare with a powerful furnace? It is just a tribe, and the furnace is a kingdom! But whether you are a friend or not, I am not sure. It is up to the king to decide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Oh! I will go see your king."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the warrior you bring must stay outside the furnace!" The fire screamed. Seeing that Richard’s troops are getting more and more, he is also a little scared. Previously, he had never seen such a large army. All the dwarves in the entire furnace kingdom are together with hundreds of thousands. The fire must not be stupid, knowing that people like Richard who can command the army will definitely be big men. This big man needs the king to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Richard immediately stopped the troops, found a suitable place outside the valley to camp, and then waited for news. At the same time, he sent people to the rear logistics team and asked them to move forward quickly. The materials that are prepared to be traded with the dwarves are in the logistics force. Since he can see the king of the furnace, Richard has the confidence to make the deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
