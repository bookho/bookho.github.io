			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he doesn't need much equipment, two artifact-level long Knife and a legendary level of destiny Gemini is enough. As for the decoration, Richard is now equipped with his own equipment, which is to look at the whole continent, and few people can compare, there are a large number of items in the gray suit. The king of life and the king of the fifth-order metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the bottleneck of the improvement of Richard’s combat power actually appears in the magical armed forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All along, Richard’s choice is to use magic in the distant war, the mode of using the elf secret sword and the sacred fighting technique in melee, it can be said that there is no dead end in all directions. board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s current magic has risen to the legendary level, and after studying the deep blue sigh, Richard discovered that for this magical meditation, The legend is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body magic is growing at a steady and high speed, and gradually begins to precipitate crystallization. At this speed, it will take a long time for Richard’s magic crystal to change from quantitative to The qualitative change has made Richard's body appear to be elevated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why the legendary strongman will strengthen once for each level, so after entering the legend, each level of improvement will have significant differences. , often worse than three levels, there is no way to fight. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Magic Arms is still at the peak of the fourth-order, it can provide Richard with 20 levels of vindictiveness, and can not exceed the legendary barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although relying on the magical armed forces to get the legendary vindictiveness, but can not get the legendary ability, so still still has a gap with the legendary strongman of the battle, but Richard The magic gain can be used to make up for the gap, so on the whole, the magical armed forces are still a huge improvement on the strength of the Master, which is why Richard can sell the fourth-order magical arms close to the fifth-order holy construction price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical forces of St. Lawrence are up to the fourth stage, the so-called fifth-order design looks very complete, only a few small blanks, but the time is up Today, Richard's construction level is far above Lawrence. It has long been seen that these small gaps are actually fatal flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on Nolan's traditional design and design ideas, these defects can not be made up. In the past, Richard also thought about how to make up for these defects, but each time he failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be the same as Richard, the same as Richard, constantly groping, constantly failing, until he can not afford to hurt, the power fell into an ordinary old man, fifth order The magical armed forces have become a distant dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, like other sacred architects, Richard is close to the peak of this field, and every holy constructor has not walked the road. The same, so to their realm, the experience of the predecessors can only provide some reference, more often have to explore in the dark alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has a unique opportunity. He has seen two actually six-level structures, deep blue sighs and Midrande battle version, after Although it is called the shrinking version of the quasi-sixth order, the reduction is mainly due to the material exceeding the upper limit of the Nolander's plane capacity. The design of the entire structure is still based on the sixth-order standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Richard’s point of view, there is virtually no difference between the Medalun combat version and the sixth-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep blue sigh, a Midrande battle version, let Richard see the gap between the sixth-order structure and the fifth-order structure, the sixth-order structure It is both offensive and defensive. If the fifth-order holy structure simulates a bloody ability, then the sixth-order configuration is equivalent to restoring a complete blood. This requires deep control over the relevant rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of Richard to analyze rules is not unique, at least it is rare throughout the continent. Over time, the rules of control are for Richard. It is not a problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other gap is the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the sixth-order structure is overwhelmingly powerful is that it uses overwhelming materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the core materials needed for the Battle of Midrand: the soul of the adult star beast, the heart of the mountain lord, the heart of the giant, and the Lord of the Farah, Sinai The three drops of the gods of the two are taken out, and they are enough to alarm the whole of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are far beyond the capabilities of the ordinary legendary powerhouse, and any one can be more than enough as the main material of the fifth-order construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the value of them can be seen from another aspect, that is, with these materials as the core, it can be determined to create a legendary level of equipment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't forget that the Medalun combat version is only a six-stage configuration with reduced performance, and shrinking is exactly the material requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard has always had a doubt, that is, what deep blue sighs do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the design of the Battle of Midrande, Richard understands why the design of the fifth-order magical armor will fail, he has been in the magic array The ingenious idea of ​​writing, but never thought about replacing more powerful materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a child, no matter how clever and intelligent, war skills are extraordinary, it is impossible to swing the warhammer ten tons, but ten tons in the ogre In the hands of the lord, it becomes a horrible killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard changed his mind and replaced the corresponding part with powerful materials. The idea was suddenly broadened. Richard now has many rare materials in his hand, in the initial place. The harvest is extremely rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he is going to put together the gods of the Highland God of War and Sinai, and refine it into a sacred core, and join the magical armed forces. Sinai’s body has not yet formed, but the god of the high gods has been cultivated for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gods of the two true gods as raw materials, plus the quantity of spring water that condenses the origin of the Faro plane, the sacred core, the effectiveness ratio The heart of the mountain lord is even stronger, chasing the heart of the adult star beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sacred core, there is a carrier that can carry the transformation of the legendary level of magic, and the magical armed forces will succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original magical armed forces are the fourth-order peaks. After the fifth-order, the magical armed forces are still the fifth-order peaks, compared to the Midrande battle version. It’s not too much difference, so Lawrence’s failure is justifiable. The old man just touched the threshold of the holy builder. The result was to challenge the sixth-order construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately called a big magician and an alchemist recruited in the family and handed them several copies of the law. Let them go to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indispensable step in refining the sacred core. When the map of the legal array is obtained, the face of the big magister has suddenly changed, and the alchemist has even screamed out. They never thought that there would be hands-on The day of the sacred core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of the sacred core refining are not very complicated, and several great magisters are competent, but the value of the divine core lies in the raw materials, which need to be refined by the true God. Even the lowest level of the sacred core requires the god of the true God. If it is a high-level sacred core, it must even be sacrificed with a powerful god of the gods, and sacrifice his soul and the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacred core has only appeared once in history. At that time, several superpowers joined forces to break the godland of a main god of Noland. The unfortunate Lord God sacrificed into a sacred core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Emperor of the founding of the emperor took this sacred core as the main material, and made the third super artifact of Noland: the ball of the magic guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard actually confesses that they are refining the sacred core, which makes the Magi and the Alchemist excited too hard, just such an experience, you can bring A great reputation, and the contact with such materials is equivalent to the direct touch of the law itself, which is also good for their own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two masters in their respective fields have a look at each other, and it is difficult to conceal the shock of their hearts. What it means to refine the sacred core is really clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods, the gods, this means that Richard has killed a true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you want to blaspheme in a sub-plane with limited strength, it is not something that ordinary legends can do, and does not have the power to master the rules in depth. Don't even want to break the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they are looking at Richard’s gaze, already full of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go, after the layout of the squad, someone will send you the body of the god and the source of the auxiliary source. I hope that one week. After that, I can get the sacred core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist is an elderly elf who sneaked into Richard and said, "You will get a The most perfect sacred core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
