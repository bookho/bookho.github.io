Inspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was in office, I heard that the Church of God of War is doing some secret projects, somewhat similar to our Black Valley plan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee indulged and asked: "There are other gods who have similar plans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole Frowning eyebrows, bitterly recalled: "The god of time must have, Xerxes ... I heard that there is, but not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li frown, said : "And these four gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone made Ptolemy look at it, looking at Richard strangely, as a former teacher Zong, Ptolemy has a different eye. The radiance of the gods in Richard is very bright in his eyes. Such a person, even if he has a war with the gods, should not speak in such a tone. This is right. The insults of all the gods of Faro, but Richard made the incomparable nature, but let Ptolemy move in the heart, and Bruno quietly exchanged a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at the sand, saying: "Maybe we got into a big trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It’s not a war with Quanfa, but it’s just four gods, and we still have time, isn’t it?” Liu Sha did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of calm in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me think about it again." After Richard finished, he fell into meditation and slowly walked in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is very quiet, knowing that this is a fairly big decision, so let Richard think for himself, and if he doesn’t know how many laps, Richard suddenly stops. Said: "I am afraid that the number of times I will come to Faro will become much more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is like laughing and laughing: "You should have come more than that." So what do you do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said heavily: "Digging, can take away, take him so much, in the land of punishment Secretly cultivating the gods, I don't believe that Neian dares to make everyone known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, Ptolemy, and several old people who were about the same age were shocked by the conversation between Richard and Liusha. Ptolemy coughed and said, "I am sorry, but I have to remind you if it is formed. If the source of this black valley is taken away, it is a revenge that cannot be resolved with the god of courage. Although I don’t know what that thing is, one thing is certain is that it is definitely created by the god of courage. Above the seven artifacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I used to be the Pope, I have the right to use the Seven Artifacts, but I don’t even know what is hidden in the Black Valley."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "Well, I will dig deeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Ptolemy I don't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any suggestions for these prisoners, for example, to get them back to their minds, or other suggestions..." Richard paused , said: "Just not to kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno and Ptolemy look at each other, then Bruno said: "There is no way, at least We can’t think of it. If it’s the real religious prisoners, we can rely on ourselves to resist the erosion of the gods. But now most of the valley is ordinary people... even if we are, we can stay awake until now. Mostly not because of my own ability, but because the god wants to keep a few playthings, it also needs fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said nothing. At this time Neiyu came in, she said nothing, just shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let them be here." Richard was holding the last line of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou did not answer and asked: "You must have seen a lot of zombies in the half-face, that is, there are a lot of shards in the body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes and said, "Yes, is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if you let them ignore it, then after a week, you will see many zombies here. The specific point is more than 23,000. They will not stay in the dark valley." "Nairy's voice is very dull." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I understand." Richard frowned and acted a few fingers subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, let your little nest do this, it's good at it, the worker bees can kill when necessary." Naiyou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Richard did not answer immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the voice of the hen’s nest sounded in the consciousness of Richard: “Master, don’t worry, even if I am hungry again, I will never move those things, they For me, it’s totally unnutritive garbage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha breathed a sigh of relief and replied in consciousness: “...then, let’s get started.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, promise not to miss one, but the half of your wings are left for me." The sound of the mother's nest is full Desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest one at the moment is already flying in Black Valley On the way, this thing is not so much a brain, it is better to say that it is a fast enough thing, it has three times the speed of the brain, but only one tenth of the computing power, wisdom is stronger than the elite fighting The unit is also stronger than the star, but that's it. Sending this thing out, it shows that the mother's nest is anxious, and it can't wait to taste the taste of the half of the wings in Richard's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden exclamation outside the wooden house: "What is that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno and care Lemi was at the window, just to see a giant insect that was only two meters long outside the window was coming out of the clouds and falling on the ground. This is also a scene like the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen people inside and outside the cabin that are so fragile compared to the overwhelming group of insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also glanced out the window, and was quite surprised. The mother’s nest sent almost 10,000 worker bees, no matter what, when the number reached a certain At the level of magnitude, the visual impact is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the painful temple and issued an order in consciousness: "Take me the thing first."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black bricks that built the painful temple are full of dark and painful power. They are also precious magic materials in Noland. They are worth a lot. Since Richard has already planned to dig away the things under the black valley, Naturally, nothing will be polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless worker bees flying up and slamming into the hall of pain, and then they show off the shocking side, actually starting to disassemble like a craftsman Their huge eyes and blades are so ingenious that they rarely leave nicks on the bricks when they are removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of finishing the worker bee, Richard said to Bruno and Ptolemy: "You are now...oh, how to deal with your beliefs."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ptolemy smiled and said: "People who have been thrown into the Black Valley, where there is faith, once I was a fanatic of Nei, but he abandoned it. I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno looked at Richard and said, "Let's say, what do you want us to do, in fact, we are no different from the waste." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and thought, "I hope to have a systematic and comprehensive study of the gods of Faro, and the perspective of the study is not believers." Or a false believer, but a completely neutral and equal angle, even we can imagine looking down on the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an unprecedented flaw. Bruno breathed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He studies the path of the god of courage, the greatest wish is to push Nei to the altar and replace him with a new god. The godhead and the priesthood are relatively fixed, a god of courage is degraded, his priesthood will be inherited by the new god, or by other gods, and there will be no courageous spirit from now on. Strictly speaking, Bruno is still big. The plane of the plane of order is down, and Richard’s move has the faint meaning of fighting against the whole plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of the meaning of Bruno’s words, so he said, “Maybe it’s awkward, but I don’t think it’s a god who cultivates the gods privately. No, such a guy has long since left the throne of the high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno stared at Richard and said, "But you can't overthrow him. It is only another god that can replace one god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not necessarily true." Richard smiled and said, and then threw his own bait: "If you agree to help me, then I can show you a book, a general textbook on how to seal God, our research. , you can start here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The universal textbook of God." For people like Bruno and Ptolemy, it is impossible to be more shocked than this. The things are, are the knowledge of the realm of God no longer mysterious and majestic, and must not be touched by ordinary people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell us what you are studying for this purpose." Bruno asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple. My ultimate goal is to be able to reconstruct the entire system of the gods of Faro. Of course, it seems that this is just a mad dream. No, so you don't have to worry about me." Richard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like we are using our own soul to trade with the devil in hell," an old man murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said, "I am not the same as the devil, I can guarantee it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard are arrogant, and Akmond is the demon blood of the abyss, and indeed does not stand with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno and Ptolemy finally nodded slowly and said, "We just want to explore the real world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and opened his arms and said, "Then your choice is incomparably correct. When you let go of your faith, you will find that the belief is just blocking the blindness of your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Li said, is a famous saying that once popular in Noland, that is when the dragon of eternal and time has just risen, the believers used to counter the words of ordinary gods, following After the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, one after another, the gods with the power of the transposition, were discovered and believed, and they also divided the beliefs of the gods in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant shrugged unconsciously and whispered: "There is a sentence behind him, he didn't say anything."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai's head is slightly biased towards Io, and also whispers: "You are awkward again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
