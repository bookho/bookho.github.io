			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrender is of course impossible, and Richard’s forces seem to have a small number Poor, even if the legendary strongman is defeated, people are more willing to believe in their own eyes. Tens of thousands of defenders seem to be able to withstand hundreds of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a muffled sound on the wall, and a city defense giant aimed at Richard’s fire, and the arrow shone on the magical light that represented the tracking. This is Hugh. The answer of the Lan Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood still, next to the ogres, and the warhammer swayed, and the scorpion flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head, the rear defense of the fortress bridge of the mainland really did not work, there were only two city defenses, and it was still common cargo, let alone Di The alchemy giants such as Scala's Wrath is that the average level of the city defense of Noland is also stronger than this. However, the city defense is expensive, maintenance is a huge sum of money, and the Shulan Empire has lost. The most fertile south can't afford a lot of city defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare...attack." Richard's finger is pointing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of the 30 builders, they approached a distance of 100 meters from the gate, in the process of marching, the construction of the knight The radiance of magic and magic is constantly shining on them, and when they arrive at the battle position, the additive effect on the body has long been almost extravagant. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are still taking out spears, screaming, and thirteen spears are turned into a torrent of light, rushing straight toward the gates of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of death instantly envelopes the hearts of every soldier on the tower, the shining light of the flying spear that shines in their eyes, and in their eyes The smile of death is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many warriors have opened their eyes in horror, and their mouths are getting wider and wider. In their pupils, a spear throwing is rapidly expanding, and fear is thoroughly They held their hearts, they couldn't breathe, they couldn't yell, they couldn't even move to dodge. They didn't want to call, but the disaster came too fast and too sudden, so that it was too late to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An earth-shattering roar, the small half of the towers flew into the sky, the two fortress gates were smashed and broken, the pieces flew to the tens of meters farthest, and collapsed a house, roaring and fire, you can see many The soldiers all flew into the sky. Under such a blow, the Shulan warriors seemed so small and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the barbaric slaughter, pointing forward with the blade, which is the signal of the total attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the explosion and the smoke have passed, and the entire main entrance of the fortress has turned into a rubble, and the knights are rolling forward under the command of Richard. Crossing the front of the Knights of the Knights, rushed into the gap, dozens of squadrons on both sides directly dismounted, rushed to the wall, began to clean up the garrison on the wall, and the formation of the formation of the knights formed The torrent of steel rushed into the fortress until it reached a depth of more than a hundred meters before it collided with the rushing garrison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the barbaric massacre and walked on the flank of the team. His movements were soothing and he was not in a hurry, but he could keep up with the knights. Charge, in this team, Richard is not conspicuous at this moment, but he is the one who really decided the battle, Red Dragon Caro has exceeded the time of summoning, returned to his lair, and Lina is riding right away. Instead of participating in the battle, I drank a bottle of powerful magic to restore the potion, waiting for the magic to return to the level that can summon Carlo again. Somehow, her gaze fell on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard at the moment looks like an ordinary warrior, but there is no piercing, and it seems quite alternative to the ones who move the steel fortress like a knight. A Shulan warrior rushed to Richard. This is a murderous, experienced veteran who knows the provocative enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard did not change his course of travel at all, just slowed his footsteps and let the Shulan warriors think they would kill, then He stabbed at random, and the brutal slaughter pierced the heart of the Shulan warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, another Shulan young warrior rushed out from the ambush alley, he was obviously frightened, screaming, and chaos in the process of assault. Waving the steel knife in his hand, but when he saw that he was going to look at Richard, the action suddenly stopped, and then he fell down. It turned out that Richard had already cut his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers initially approached Richard intently and unconsciously, and kept a little attention on him at all times. Richard is the leader and the core of them. And the spiritual pillar, although everyone knows that Richard spent the past year in the field of the absolute field, but they think that Richard is still a magician, and has not yet reached the level of the big magician, the level of this thing In most cases it is the last word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was striding forward, following the construction of the knight, and he seemed to be guarding the wing of the assault knight, and in fact he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always enemies close to Richard, but the followers see the savage massacre continually rising, understating the heart, cutting the throat, or piercing What other vital parts go, the brutal slaughter is like a phantom at this moment, erratic in the hands of Richard, does not deal with the enemy's weapons, but directly penetrates the deadly key, and ends the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, seven or eight Shulan fighters fell under Richard’s knife, and Richard never wasted a second knife on one person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers have seen that Richard’s knife is incredibly fast, extremely simple and practical, never dragging the water, and the action is soothing, just in the process of cutting out The moment suddenly accelerated, and one hit must be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the art of true killing. The only purpose is to harvest life. There is no hesitation or compromise between life and death. Seeing it for a long time, followers Suddenly, the chill is rising, and there is an indescribable cold feeling. It goes straight up to the back of the brain, and it is not a pleasant thing to be a rival with someone like Richard. It’s like fighting with the white night, as long as he still Being able to move, as long as he has a knife in his hand, he is likely to make a fatal blow at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, they saw the change of Richard, this feeling, the way of killing, only the style that will be in the battlefield, However, why is Richard not a big magister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is paying attention to a number of places at the same time. In his consciousness, the soldiers who rushed to himself are full of flaws, and they do not pose any threat. Don't they know that yelling and yelling is impossible to increase their combat effectiveness? At least the strong people of Dakosodas will not be scared by the big tricks. For this kind of enemy, Richard can take care of it with a knife. No need to think through the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear’s attention is on other fronts. He constantly monitors the movements of the troops and orders them to mobilize followers and knights. Under the command, any Shulan people’s organized resistance was easily crushed. The Shulan people discovered that Richard’s knights were few, but they were together but sharp like a knife, and the number of Hulan People are like chunks of cheese, heavy cheese, but also free cutting by the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is waiting, waiting for the strong among the Shulans, and the knights are pushing too fast, and Richard believes that the Sanctuary of the Shulans will never be able to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t wait for a long time, a Shulan sanctuary finally appeared, he was not attacking the formation of the knights, but the plunge The elite knights fighting on the wall, obviously, he wants to intercept Richard's back road, or just want to find a safe point to join the battle, the construction of the knight is too fierce, all on one body All are vindictive, only look at the number, the single sanctuary does not have a few costume knights who dare to block the rush of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this Shulan Sanctuary chose the Qifeng Knight but it is a bigger mistake. This is a tall tribal woman with a more ordinary tribal woman. More pretty looks, but her hands-on style is more fierce than other people. Her weapon is a three-legged rifle made of stainless steel. The gun is covered with serrated teeth. She is like a predatory female bear. From the darkness, a shot broke through a forward knight who rushed to the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fortress, the lips of Richard, who was rushing forward, sneaked a sneer and said softly in his heart: "Catch you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the order was passed through the soul link to the thirty-seven knights who were still alive on the wall, the Sanctuary of the Shulan tribe The strong man’s heart stunned, and the movement on his hand actually slowed down because she found that all the knights in front of him had thrown their opponents, and all the eyes were gathered on her body, and they were dozens of pairs in an instant. The expressionless cold eyes gazed, even if she was already a sanctuary, she could not help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the squadron, who was pierced by the chest, suddenly turned his hands and clenched the rifle in the chest. The hands of the Knights were so powerful. It was not like a man who was seriously injured and killed. The Shulan Sanctuary suddenly provoked a long gun. He took the Knight of the squadron in the air, but the knight did nothing, and he seized her. Gun body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other squadrons are already around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, the screaming roar of the sanctuary is constantly screaming, and soon her snoring is mixed with painful screams, then fear In the end, it became a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye." Richard said quietly in his heart, as if he was saying goodbye to her, this is a habit he did not know. Say hello to each opponent in consciousness, and say goodbye after killing each other. This is the habit he developed in the field of extinction. If not, Richard fears that he will be lost in the seemingly endless waiting and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
