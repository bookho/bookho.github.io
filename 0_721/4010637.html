			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the grudges between the various giants, even the bloody hatred So important, if the big trees that are inhabited have to be dumped, what is the point of the monkeys fighting again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the iron-blooded Dagong is that he has not yet entered the ranks of the super-powerful, and the Tibetan sword is about to fight against the bloody public at this time. Obviously it is not as simple as it is, obviously What the Millennium Empire was keenly aware of, so he used the most gentle means to test the cornerstone of the beginning of the alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Holy Alliance is annexed by the other two empires, the treatment of the ordinary aristocrats of fait is likely to not change, because they are the cornerstone of a country and weak enough. However, the floating islands are not the same, they must be the object of being weakened by the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is an opportunity, whether it is the Holy Tree Dynasty or the Millennium Empire, the first time will completely dismember these giants, the local aristocrats of the two historic empire, Absolutely not let the foreign faces appear in the stable upper circles, so if you surrender, the floating island giants must be the last surrender of a group of nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wealthy family owner suddenly took a conference table and angered: "This Long De Steader is really poisonous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence comes out, several homeowners immediately reveal a stunned color, and Richard also remembers the last strange insistence of Marshal Ronald Stade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the danger of falling into the sun, Philip doesn’t have to give up the convenience of the Legion’s fortress, and walk out of the rising sun, go to Dak The two super-powers of Soudas decided to fight the battle to open the entire dusk. Now it seems that the day is not the same, it seems to be arbitrarily forcing Philip to have no choice to enter the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people did not think that this time it was Philip said: "I believe that Long De Stead will not do this kind of thing, he just received a certain Some people are misled and insist on doing what they think is right. This guy is a natural soldier, but sometimes it is not so smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because The emperor said this, and the owners of the family reluctantly accepted it. There is no way to accept it. Marshal Ronald Stade is also a strong man in the legend, otherwise he will not be responsible for the whole day of the undefeated battle. In the situation, any legendary strongman is a valuable force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, no one in the round table can laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips did not happen like nothing, said in a calm voice: "The second thing is that I am ready to give up the throne of the Holy Alliance, for the League. In terms of the throne of the emperor, it is not necessary to be a Mingjun, but it must be a strong person. Now, I am no longer qualified to sit on it, so I will hold an assessment of the emperor and the emperor in advance. As far as their current points are concerned, my personal recommendation includes: Nero, who may not be the top powerhouse, but will certainly become the emperor in the history of the entire league, followed by Nyris. After experiencing the baptism of the sanctuary, he now has the purest Thunder Destructor blood of the younger generation of the royal family. Stepping into the legend should not be a problem, but the problem with Nyris is that his current character is not majestic. Finally, It’s a stranger who even has some surprises for me. Ryan, yes, Ryan is only thirteen years old, but he shows that the blood is pure enough to be no more than Nyris. If the lucky god cares, Ryan will There is a great chance to be the first strongman of this generation. Maybe there is an opportunity to approach my realm, but Ryan is too young. If he is allowed to board the throne, you need to have enough patience to wait for him to grow up. Get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of the giants are immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero and Nyris are both popular candidates for the succession of the throne. Originally, Nyris has fallen behind in points, but in the past few years, he has formed an alliance with Richard. The power of his personal name has advanced by leaps and bounds. Recently, a point has been brought close to Nero. Now Nero is no longer in absolute superiority, and when Nyris breaks through the sanctuary, the hidden talent finally begins to appear. The blood power has been greatly improved, and the blood of the Thunder Destroyer has been raised to the second stage of the bloodline in the Sanctuary period. The future of the strong is very broad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder Destroyer is the racial collective name of the ancient giants, which also includes many specific races, the legendary star destroyer, and the powerful Thunder Titan. Even the weakest lightning giants have the power to not lose to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal thunder ruined bloodline develops to the second stage, the racial imprint of the deep veins will emerge, Nyris has the secret of the Titan The blood, in the entire Thunder Destroyer race, can also be regarded as a tyrannical existence, and its future is naturally limitless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Nilez’s shortcomings are equally obvious, that is his personality problem, although Philip did not say it, but how can a wealthy homeowner not know, this It is also a private message that has recently plagued the royal family and the giants. After awakening the blood of the dark Lei Titan, I don’t know what happened during this process. Nyris suddenly had an unexpected personality change, the most obvious. The place is a bit confused about his gender orientation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this kind of thing in the private circle is not worth making a fuss, some people regard it as elegant. However, it is another matter to let such a person sit in God. The entire Holy Alliance will have no light on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero is indeed wise and steady, but his biggest problem is that his talent is limited. Although his current force has surpassed the ordinary sanctuary, he has stopped here. Even if you can break through the legend, I am afraid it will be something after middle age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Alliance is not actually an empire in the traditional sense, it is more inclined to a loose aristocracy, the royal family and the giants are semi-alliance, semi-dominant, In this pattern, the power of the emperor is very necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nero is still facing another problem that cannot be circumvented, that is, the founding father of the League, Charles, once had a rule that if anyone in the royal family could destroy the Thunder When the blood of the person evolved to the third stage, he could become the Thunder Destroyer of the corresponding race. If the then emperor was not a legendary powerhouse, then he would automatically become the emperor of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the current pace, when Nyris goes deep into the legendary field, it is very likely that the blood force will evolve to the third stage, which will inevitably lead to turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ryan is an unexpected candidate, as the youngest prince, although he has not entered the vision of most nobles before, but he is now It shows a talent that is comparable to Nyris, and more importantly, from what aspect he seems to be a normal teenager, there can be more than one maid to prove this with his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Ryan, after waiting for more than ten years, you may get an emperor with good military strength and unrecognized government affairs, but this choice is tantamount to gambling No one knows what will happen in a dozen years. Moreover, Ryan is too young to see any character qualities that can be called characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decades of Philip’s reign, most of the time was not a qualified emperor, he could even describe it with ignorance, but before the throne Philip is a powerful figure who is devastated, and its advantages and disadvantages are extremely clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, this heir chooses, need to vote." Asked the Iron Man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp nodded and said, " Vote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
