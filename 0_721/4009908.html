			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage does not want others to visit her half-plane, whether it is a dragon The country, the magic lake, the element pool or the energy-absorbing forest, can all cause a sensation on the mainland. Gordon is just a special case, and the legendary mage does not worry about the man whose debt is overdue. In the foreseeable future, Gordon did not have the possibility to pay off his debts, which means that his future is still in the hands of the legendary Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the account, Gordon never had this idea, he would rather kill in the blood and fire day and night to earn a little meager interest. And are not willing to owe debts. Every Archimonde is proud and cherishes its glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I want to get rid of the legendary Master’s account, especially the name of this legendary mage is Su Hailun. It’s a very dangerous thing. The little half of the dragon country will know. It is the dragons who have to pay a heavy price to pay the bill, not to mention that they do not owe anything to Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun glanced at dozens of people surrounded by magic light curtains, small eyebrows wrinkled together, some unhappy said: "Your thirteen construction How did the Knights come only eight? Others? In the back, these are the second-order knights? Are you going to make up the number?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;歌Shake his head and said: "There are some people who still need to guard the half-plane. The war there is not over yet. The ability of Han Erdong is not suitable for the hell environment. It is useless to go. I brought three this time. The ten second-order knights are all elites that have followed me for a long time. Their individual combat power is not too strong, but as a whole, they can exert unimaginable combat power on the battlefield! It is made up of several big devils. The hundreds of devils led by them are only defeated in front of them. The combat power of this unit is no worse than the eight guys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun: "Okay! I don't know how to fight, I don't know you about hell, I believe you once. No. I have never been to hell, are you sure you want to kill enough devils to be able to let the devil lord listen to what we say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon said with great certainty: "Yes! We are the blood of the devil in Archimonde, so the strongest of the ancestors have the experience of fighting hell, because the devil is the creature we hate most. The record of hell in the family is also very rich and accurate. I It can be guaranteed that as long as we have enough devils to kill, their lords will listen carefully to our words. If you kill a lot, you may let the devil lord directly believe what you said."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is holding his chin, thoughtfully: "It sounds very interesting, but you should also pay attention to the art of expression..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes suddenly became very dangerous, slowly said: "It doesn't matter, this time I will let the devil lord have a deep impression on me, and then seriously consider each of my suggestions! I want to start building a biography. The door is over, let your men prepare for the battle! This time I spent a lot of money to get the coordinates of a certain layer of hell from an old guy. Hey, although I want to find a just ready to invade Noland's hell level is not easy, but the feeling of being blackmailed still makes me very unhappy! I hope this harvest can be enough to make up for the loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She particularly emphasized After harvesting the word, Gordon nodded hard and his face gradually became cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the busy magic scorpion and the sorcerer erect built a new portal in the light curtain. As soon as it was formed, there was a strong dampness and corrosion from the magical fluctuations of the portal, and there was a faint beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Gotton raised his hands and swords. The sword had already ignited the raging fire in the abyss. He strode into the portal and the first rushed into hell. Behind him, the eight knights formed a battle formation and stepped into the portal. Behind it, there is a neat array of thirty knights. As a second-order knight, they all have close combat power of 18, and they are a force that cannot be ignored. And unlike the individual strong, they are the army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the legendary wizard picked up the skirt, a small jump, jumped into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the portal is quietly standing, as if nothing has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic sorcerer and the sorcerer are constantly busy, continuing to complete the instructions issued before the legendary mage. Rebuild the magic light curtain, and prepare the magic box for the spoils in the designated position, seal the magic box, and even seal the magic floating ship. Naturally, the cages are also ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time just passed a few minutes, the portal will open again, this time the first out of the formation of the Knights square, they are full of damage on the body and the sword Stained blood, and even some people's wounds are still smouldering with blue smoke, still being corroded by the blood of the devil. When I entered the 30-time knights, there were only 21 left when I came out, and the battle was fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, eight of Gordon’s followers stepped out of the portal. They are also injured by everyone, but fortunately, there is no reduction, but Kailan was dragged out by her brother, Kade. She was motionless, life and death were unknown, and apparently the injury was extremely serious. There were three deep cracks on the steel fortress-like heavy armor, and the smoke was constantly ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark pastor Asiris began to give Kailan treatment as soon as he stepped out of the portal. He constantly flipped the magic book of the black cover in his hand, and the treatment, cleansing, and blessing of the gods continued to fall on Kailan, and the cleaning technique was repeated many times. She only occasionally snorted, and the body still couldn't move. It is obvious that the injury is only control, but not improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden roar of Gordon after the portal, and then a very strong breath even penetrated the portal and penetrated directly into the half-face! Suddenly, the powerful horror of the horror came in. The wounds on the knights were even more smoky. Asiris trembled with his hands, and the magic was almost interrupted. He bit his teeth and opened a reel. The strong blessings shrouded Living in Kailan’s body did not make the situation worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the energy-absorbing tree in the half-plane suddenly swayed quickly, and this horror was dissolved and absorbed in an instant. Then there was a more angry roar after the portal! The huge volume makes the entire half-plane vibrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s roar continued to sound, then suddenly inserted into the voice of Su Helun, and was not drowned in the roar and roar: “Don’t hurry back, grind What are you doing? Give me in, don't block the road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon suddenly flew out of the portal, and a white foot appeared at the same time behind him. It is obviously that it brought in Gordon. His body was in the air and fell steadily on the ground. Compared with the male posture when going, the current Gotton is bloody around the body, and the hair has been eroded by the blood of the devil, and it has become a volatility of steel needles. The flames on the swords of the two hands have been extinguished, and the front of the sword is full of gaps and breaks. I have long known how many devils have been killed. Even so, this man is still in a strong position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the legendary mage did not appear behind the snow-white foot in the portal. She took her foot back and the crisp voice passed from the portal. Come: "This guy, let me fix it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
