Our two private agreements are not binding. According to the practice of the Dragon Temple, the priests should take turns to pretend to sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the title of Eternal and Time Dragon, so I also have some privileges."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already have a title Nolan was also taken aback. The title does not only require a lot of sacrifices, but also the special attention of the eternal and time dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s face glowed and said, “That’s easy to do. You are here for me for a while, I will arrange it immediately.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the figure of Nolan’s hurried departure, Richard sighed in his heart, and there was a fight in places where there was interest, even if the Eternal Dragon Hall was no exception. In the past, there were some high-ranking Vatican, these are still not obvious, but Vatican has gone, and the great priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple immediately began to fight against each other. God is for them, the beauty in the eyes of the ghosts, the jewels in the sinister eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t wait for a long time, I saw Nolan’s return, came with her, and hoped that the other two were familiar but barely dealt with. Great god officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the four great priests, there is also a delicate and delicate figure, it is Ryan, Richard has seen it at the election ceremony, the original Ryan has not Lost in the appearance of Nyris, now replaced with the sacred robes of the eternal dragon temple, the temperament is more high and clean, actually has a somewhat sacred taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no original tenderness and femininity, but it became very good and murderous. She went straight to Richard and said directly to the local: His Royal Highness, taking turns to pretend to be a sacrifice is the tradition of the Eternal Dragon Hall. Now that the sand and Van Gogh are gone, I hope you can respect the tradition of the Eternal Dragon Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He looked at Xi Xi and said faintly: "If I don't respect the tradition, how are you going to refuse my sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Xixi and the other two great priests exchanged their eyes and said, "In principle, we can do this. If three of the four great priests agree, now you have no right to sacrifice at this dragon temple. Even the entire Archimonde family has no right to sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Xixi and the other two great priests and suddenly smiled and said: "There is not much time left for the flow of sand and Vatican. You have forgotten them so soon. This memory is really amazing. Do you think that as a great priest, you can do what you want in the eternal dragon temple, even I can put my mind on my god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Shen Xi’s face sank and said: "His Highness, please pay attention to your wording. Here is the Temple of Eternal Dragons, not your floating island of Archimonde, the actions of the great priests, you are not qualified to comment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said: "You also know that our Archimonde is a floating island nobility. Since you are so confident in your rights, why not try? See if I can drop my floating island to the seventh floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of hope is getting more and more ugly, the cold said: "His Highness, Please go out from here immediately. Now, from now on, Eternal Dragon Temple does not welcome your visit, nor welcome any visit to Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard's face is getting colder and colder, saying: "Hey, you are crazy." He then looked at the other two great priests and said, "You, are you going to be as crazy as her?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two great priests flashed their hesitation, but they became firm and came to a default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan then smiled and said, "Sorry, Richard, if they are united, I have no right to overturn their decision."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded to Nolan and said, "I understand, it doesn't matter. I still remember the agreement between us and respect the promises I have had. Don't worry. The cooperation between us will continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyce sneer and said: "If it is cooperation in sacrifice, there will be no more in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned his head, his eyes were as electric, and he stared at Xi Xi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, even though my heart was cold and subconsciously stepped back a few steps, she immediately woke up and immediately shy and screamed, screaming: "Come, guard, drive this person out of the Eternal Dragon Hall, forever Don't let him come in again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal dragon temple guards of the whole body armor emerged from the darkness, but they immediately recognized Richard, so they slowly Encircled, there is no rush to start, Richard has a special relationship with Liusha and Vatican, and everyone in the Eternal Dragon Hall is well known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer looked to hope, but looked at the other two great priests, calmly said: "In addition to Archimonde and future In addition to the status of the Duke of the League, I am still a sacred architect. Who dares to cut off the road of my sacrifice, the deadly enemy of my life, you can think about it, what kind of result will be enemies with a holy builder? Even if you are the servants of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, if I remember correctly, you are not alone in this world, and there are families and loved ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face changed a lot, and sighed: "Licha, you are a great priest who threatens the eternal dragon temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say: "I don't think the consequences will be more serious than the threat to a holy builder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a big priest stepped forward and said: His Royal Highness, Hi, why bother to get this point, isn’t it a good step? We will try our best to serve His Highness, and also ask His Highness. Respect the tradition of the Dragon Temple. After all, Ryan may become the next oracle, and let him grow up as soon as possible, which is good for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It sounds a bit reasonable, come." Richard greeted, and twenty squadrons sneaked in, and they carried a full ten different sizes of the magic box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single order, the Cavaliers will open all the magic boxes, and the sacrifices in the box will be displayed in front of everyone, even though Nolan has already known the answer. At this moment, I saw such a number of top-level sacrifices with my own eyes, and I could hardly believe my eyes, and hopes to exclaim "so many sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Another great priest is pale and whispered: "All are top-level offerings, all top-level offerings"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee will take it all In my eyes, there is not much ridicule in my heart, and I have been with the sand for a long time. Richard also knows that the grace of time is almost the meaning of survival for these priests, let alone these great priests, The powerful and special existence of Iowa has seen so many sacrifices, and it is estimated to be going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it, this is the sacrifice that I am preparing to sacrifice today. These sacrifices are in hand. Do you think that I have to sacrifice here? Whether the Holy Tree Dynasty or the Eternal Dragon Temple of the Millennium Empire will welcome me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face suddenly became very ugly, her lips moved a few times, wanting to desperately order the guards of the shrine to attack, leaving Richard to stay, It is good to have these sacrifices as existing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not really crazy after all, knowing that relying on these shrine guards to leave Richard, is simply looking for death, if the legendary deputy regiment of the Knights of the Temple If you are still there, it may be possible, but the deputy heads are the guardians of Vatican’s heavenly elections. After Vatican returns to the field of darkness, they will disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to kill Richard with the power of eternal and timeless dragons, but here is the eternal dragon temple, but hopelessly, Her strength is far from enough to complete such a killing. In her estimation, it is probably possible that the four great gods will work together, but Nolan will never cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard said faintly: "However, even if you don't have these sacrifices, you also want to block the way of my sacrifice. In fact, I am quite Curious, what you are doing today dare to let the eternal and the dragon of time know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Richard actually began to surge the power of time. There are always subtle divine loops in which Licha is flying, and the power of time in the Eternal Dragon Hall has also risen. It is a vague tendency to be influenced by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually have the title of Eternal Dragon." Greek lost his voice, this is what she never thought of, but the sight of the power of the eyes will not False, Richard clearly got the favor of the eternal and the dragon of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Richard gets the lowest-level time traveler title for a non-God-like oracle, he also has the privilege of offering sacrifices at any eternal dragon temple, no matter In which plane is the eternal dragon temple, what kind of race is there to guard the priest, and hope that there is no way to stop the sacrifice at this moment, and the dragon temple is not to be mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shock, he bit his teeth and said, "Do you think that a time traveler can command a great priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice did not fall, the speed of time to the convergence of Richard significantly accelerated, then condensed a strip of light, surrounded by the rotation of the dance, if you look carefully, you can see that the light belt is Numerous subtle god symbols are assembled, which is a sign of further promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
