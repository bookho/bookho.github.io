			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same night, the girl is standing on a vast river On the side, the surface of the river is gentle, but the bottom is an undercurrent. The banks of the river are all dense rainforests. On the shore of the river, you can see a piece of dead wood floating. It is not a dry trunk, but the back of a giant crocodile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the mountains and the sea, jumped up and jumped into the river with a splash, sinking to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original calm river suddenly boiled! Numerous giant crocodile swarmed and squeezed each other, desperately sneaking in the direction of the mountains and the sea. For them, girls are supremely delicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a blink of an eye, the river turns from boiling to arrogant, and the waves of water are rushing to the height of tens of meters! In the water column, a giant crocodile struggled to helplessly roll, and some even were thrown to a hundred meters away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crocodile group is not afraid of death, and then marches to the mountains and the sea strolling at the bottom of the river, and then the strips are thrown far away by the girls. Even after some of the most fierce giants were thrown away, they had to swim back and rejoin the ranks of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the mountains and the sea were so troublesome, the small fists went out to the top of the box, and there was a huge wave in the river! Dozens of giant crocodiles, like spewing fireworks, rose into the sky with huge waves, and then fell to their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene was repeated until the girl came ashore from the other end of the river, and the crocodile group was unwilling to disperse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl after the water was wet, her hair was close to her face, and she was still biting a very fat fish. With a bang, the girl spit out the fat fish and then walked to the distance to go. Her little hand still grabbed the tail of a giant crocodile, so she dragged the giant behemoth with a length of more than ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the girl has raised a huge bonfire, and the giant crocodile is ripening on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the crocodile skin and bones scattered around the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea that are full of food and drink are almost unable to open the eyelids even a small slit, and finally decided to take a nap for half an hour. So she found a huge rock, and the stick removed the upper half, leaving a flat stone surface, and then climbed up. Her head just fell to the rock face, and the snoring sounded softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is very quiet, only the snoring of the bonfire and her snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard stretched out and climbed up from the ground. The morning light is slight, the trade wind is still dry and gentle, but there is a hint of coolness. The tyrannosaurus was still asleep, and the rest of the earth had not yet woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s ear suddenly moved, standing straight and looking in the direction of his own. After a while, the tyrannos suddenly woke up from the deep sleep, and began to groan each other, making a low voice, it is very uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the horizon, there were suddenly dozens of barbarian warriors. They found out that Richard immediately screamed in excitement, instigated the wildebeest to rush at full speed, and then surrounded Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not move, letting them occupy the position of the Quartet. He leaned his arms against the trunk behind him and looked at their color decoration. He asked faintly: "Tread the Horde. Are you coming to chase me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The head of the barbarian youth warrior glanced at Richard, and suddenly saw the bracelet of the animal tooth wrapped around Richard's wrist, immediately stunned: "The tooth of the beast! You really is the appointed person!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Li: "What is the agreed person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young warrior has jumped from the tyrannosaurus, Strode to the front of Richard, violently tearing the animal's blouse, revealing the red and white chest, rubbing his chest hard, then pointing at Richard, said: "I, Gul Zaba, yes One of the best warriors in the Tengfeng tribe. Now I want to challenge you! If you can't win me, just roll back to Noland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why should I fight with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurzaba squeezed this sentence almost from his teeth: "Because you don't deserve to see the mountain and the sea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Richard asked again. There seems to be something he doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurzaba scornfully said: "Noland's soft egg is a problem! You don't know this question!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha floated a faint smile and said, "Do you need to be born and killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gour Zaba looked at Richard’s thinner body than himself. He shook his head and said, “It’s good to give the winner. You can rest assured that I don’t want to bully the weak, as long as you are willing to return to Noland. Go, I can let you go now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Richard smiled indifferently and asked: "Gulzhaba, you are not The most powerful warrior of the younger generation of the Tengfeng tribe?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurzaba’s face suddenly swelled red and said: “I am the top ten. Warriors!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head and said: “Go ahead for the first one, you are just wasting my time, unless you are together.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurzaba is raging and slamming A thick knife at the waist, said: "We barbarians warriors never bully! I am alone, can already knock you down ten times! Pull the knife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that Richard has solved both the double-knife and the destiny, put it aside, and then walked over to Gulzaba and said, "To deal with you, this is enough."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are insulting me! I will let you pay the price!" Gulzhaba screamed like a thunder, and put a big knife on the ground, then picked up his fist, like a rushing The rhinoceros rushed to Richard! Fang Yuanzhang shook the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood still, and then the whole body flashed, letting Gul Zaba run like a thunder. Almost no one can see how he ducked. Richard’s next move was to go to Gulzhaba, and the barbarian youth flew up and hurried for dozens of laps in the air, then caught by Richard. He pulled down at the waist, and immediately slammed into the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke suddenly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the smoke gradually dispersed, the onlookers of the tribal warriors opened their mouths and looked incredulously at a shallow pit on the ground. It was a pit that was born out of the body of Gulzhaba. Even with the incomparably sturdy body of the barbarian warriors, it could not withstand the impact of multiple powers overlapping. Gul Zaba is struggling to raise his head, but his eyes are awkward, apparently still in a dizzy state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the side of Gulzhaba, Richard is playing a short knife with a handle on the horn. It was the short knife that Gulzhaba hung around his waist, and he was also the pride of the barbarian warrior. It is now in the hands of Richard, and for every barbarian warrior, it is an unbearable shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurzaba was so hard to see the scene before him, immediately shy and anger, screaming, and want to grab back the knife. But when he moved, the internal organs were just like turning over, and they were planted again. This time, even the power to lift the upper body was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard naturally knows the role of the short knife to the barbarian warrior, so he will take the short knife of Gulzhaba. He took a short knife, looked at the blade, and then slashed the knife into the sheath. He threw the short knife in front of Gulžaba and said faintly: "Before calling Nolande soft egg, think about whether you can beat one. Soft eggs. If you are in Noland, if you are in Noland, it is just a soft egg that you can deceive. Now, you should answer my question, or do you say that you are not convinced, ready to play again? But I said In the front, if you lose again, I will take your warrior's knife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulzhaba struggles with perseverance and exhausts the whole body The power stood up slantingly and tried to keep his back that was almost so painful and numb. His face was red and purple, staring at Richard, his eyes covered with bloodshot eyes. But now he knows that he is not playing opponents for ten times, so this challenge is undoubtedly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our barbarian warriors are not cowards who can't afford to lose!" Gulzaba said slyly. Then began to answer Richard's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard already knew everything he needed to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mothers of the mountains and the sea are the saints who guarded the Daxueshan Temple in generations and have a lofty status among the various barbarian tribes in Calando. Her mother used to be the great warrior of the holy temple, and her status was only under the great elders and the great sacrifice. After leading the samurai warriors to defeat the army of the Millennium Empire, the prestige of the mother of the mountain and the sea was even more than one. Later, although she insisted on collecting the leader of the invaders, the emperor of the Millennium Empire was a husband, which aroused great dissatisfaction among many barbarians, but after the birth of the mountain and the sea, the blessings of the beasts, all the dissatisfaction All disappeared. However, in those days, I did not know how many tyrannical barbarians were stunned by the decision of the mother of the mountain and the sea, and even went far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea have only once visited the mainland of Noland, and they have given the name of the god of the gods to the Noord. The little magician passed by, and agreed with him five years later. This is not an ordinary agreement, but a promise that may become a lifelong commitment. As the son of the gods, the mountains and the sea have the fate of the blood of the strong. The first child she had born with a strong potential was handed over to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When born in the mountains and the sea, the great sacrifice of the temple is claimed to be the god of the beast, and among the children born in the mountains and the sea, some people may become The incarnation of the beast god walking in the world. Therefore, the first child handed over to the temple by the mountains and the sea has been designated as the next saint of the temple and the spiritual leader of the entire temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For any barbarian powerhouse, being the father of the saints is a glory. They will never allow a Nolander to get this opportunity. If you want to give birth to a saint with the mountains and the sea, you must meet two conditions at the same time: first, defeat other qualified strongmen; second, defeat the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the barbaric tradition, the mountains and the sea now have the ability and power to have children, and the last time she can delay is four years later. It is also the date of her agreement with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
