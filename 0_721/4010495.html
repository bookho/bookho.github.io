			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of Calando is very vast, with countless tribes scattered throughout the continent There are all kinds of beliefs here. In addition to the beast gods, there are many weak gods, even half gods, who are receiving worship and worship from their respective tribes. The tribes on the mainland are nominally composed of four elders in the southeast and northwest. Under the command, the Central Snow Mountain Presbyterian Church is still above the four Presbyterian Churches, and the Daxueshan Holy Temple is the spiritual leader and holy place of the Calando tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presbyterian Church does not interfere with the internal affairs of the tribes, and even the inter-tribal war operations do not interfere, most of them involve the entire Kalando, or At least the big things in a vast area will make decisions. The elders are mostly the strong ones of Calanton. This is the binding force of the Presbyterian Church. Once the Presbyterians make a decision, they want to implement it. Very easy, confrontation with the Presbyterian, is equivalent to a group of strong, even if it is the largest tribe of Carando, you must think twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribal ecology of Calando is like the sights on the mainland, still quite desolation and primitive, the people ruled by the largest kingdom here, and Nolan Germany is a big duchy. The barbarian is the most important to the brave. The real warrior has great freedom of movement. He can even listen to the words of the elders. Therefore, the resolution made by the Elder C. Calendon is not very binding. To stay away, the elders decided to act in accordance with the tradition of Calando, treating Richard with the attitude of the brave, instead of dispatching the direct army of the Presbyterian Church to pursue the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for how many strong people have gone to find trouble for Richard, it’s not something that the Presbyterians are worried about. It’s a very good thing to take the tooth of the beast god. There are honors, especially in the case where the holy script that determines the husband of the mountain and the sea will be held in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked on the wasteland. At this time, it was not clear what happened in the holy temple of Daxueshan, but he was not in a hurry, and soon there will be someone. Reported, and sure enough, the wasteland on the far side of the wilderness, the smoke of a knight, his violent tyrannosaurus is the king of the wilderness, only the real warriors can tame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped his steps, but he was quite admired by the ability of people to follow, and he was able to find himself so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrannical tyrannosaurus rushed to Richard for more than ten meters, only to suddenly stop, the barbarian warriors on its backs vacated, and several turns in the air, It floated in front of Richard in a fluttering manner. When he landed on his feet, the whole person was like a root, blending with the earth, standing like a mountain of Yuelu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at the imposing barbarian warrior and said, "Bali Ba Li, long time no see, you have become stronger again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li staring at Li After checking it for a long time, I said, "You have changed a lot, have you been fighting in other planes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibaly immediately said: "Well, I am worried that you are not strong enough. I want to take back the teeth of the beast and wash the shame that I lost to you last time. Now Our ranks should be close to each other, no one will say that I bullied you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "The same level, but Someone will say that I am bullying you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense, go to war." Baaliba slammed low, and the power of the hair would be loaded with the upper body. The shock shattered, revealing a muscle wrapped like a piece of iron, ready for battle, he just remembered something and asked: "Right, you need to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "No, quick and quick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard made Baaliba force angry, and gave a low voice, and the momentum slowly climbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you lose, answer my question." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li snorted and slammed hard, one step The violent shock wave of the circle swelled in all directions. This move is very similar to the slamming of the Angkor people. It can directly stun the weaker opponent, but the shock wave passes over Richard, and if the breeze passes the stone, No effect, Richard is now very strong and has a magical protection. It is that the Angkor Ma Warlord’s kick can not shake him, but Baalba is weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunning the earthquake wave has no effect, Baaliba Lideng a moment, this short loss of life, Richard has appeared in his side, reaching out Lightly patted on his shoulder, and then returned to the original place, Ba Li Ba Li's face suddenly ugly to die, if there is a knife in the hands of Richard, he has already cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not satisfied, then come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baalibali's face was reddish and his mouth was strong: "I was negligent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, come again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba has a deep sigh, this time solidly stepping forward, punching with Richard, and Lee’s hand stretched out, already in Baalibali On the wrist, one pull and one belt, it was easy to turn him up, and he broke into the ground. The land in the wilderness was very hard. The bones of Baalibali were harder. He was deeply smashed on the ground. The pit, just shook his head when he got up, it looked a little dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliba has rounded his eyes and stared at Richard, just like seeing a ghost, he simply did not know how he was thrown out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I came to Calando, Richard’s sacred fighting technique was just beginning to wear fur. Now, in the past few years, his second consciousness has been studying the priests all the time. Fighting, now rumored and even on the battle of the official Iyo, has been able to keep pace with the sand, the sacred fighting is the inheritance of the eternal dragon temple, seemingly simple, but it is a combination of the rules of the plane, want to delve deeper In the words, the mystery is simply endless. The great priest who understands the rules of the plane by studying the sacred fighting techniques alone is not very rare in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to come again?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li’s throat was as low as a beast, but the momentum suddenly blew, shaking his head and saying, “No, I am not at all Your opponent, what do you want to ask, even if you ask, I will tell you what I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard already knows what he wants to know. Things: The festival of the temple is ahead of schedule. The reason for the sudden advance of the festival seems to be because of a very important person, but the identity of this individual is not what Baalibali can know. Baalibali is only vague. I heard that this person will also participate in the ceremonies, and will become a man of mountains and sea. The snow-capped elders seem to be quite optimistic about this person, and the great ritual Ulazazu did not express objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, the beast god has already approved this matter." When asked this sentence, Richard's face was already ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The beast god will not be so easy to release the gods, no matter who, only the brave in the ceremonies to defeat the parties, it is possible to get the favor of the beast god. After that, Baalibali added another sentence: "But the festival is held in advance, and it must have been the god of the beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and said nothing. After a moment, Richard asked: "Where is the Snowy Mountain Temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to the temple, you ... you are crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "From the moment I came to Calando, I was already crazy, Snowy Mountain. Where is the holy temple, I have to go to the ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal stared at Richard, then shook his head and said, "You are defeated. My warrior, I should respect your request, but if you want to win in the festival, it is impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the temple? Place." Richard repeated his question again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you walked in this direction, about a month or so, through the frozen canyon, and then across the giant crocodile... Baalibali said, while drawing a simple diagram on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map drawn by Baalibali will not be accurate, but it is enough, so Richard nodded and said, "I have nothing to ask." You are not going to attend the ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have lost, what are you doing, we are attending ceremonies, and we hope to fight against powerful opponents, and Raising from the battle is not the hope of becoming the father of the Son in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I am gone."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute." Ba Li Ba Li stopped Richard and said: "You can't participate in the Holy Scriptures, only the talents recognized by the Beast God are qualified."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "Yes, the beast will recognize me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not say Another sentence is that if the beast is not recognized, then it is enough to kill the person it recognizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s ear suddenly sounded a voice: “You don’t have to go to the ceremonies.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is a bit rich, the content is very arrogant, but the tone is very sincere, because the barbarian youth came to think this way, this is also a very familiar person, Amu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
