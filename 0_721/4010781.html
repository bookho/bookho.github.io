			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill this time clenched the staff in his hand, and the cold said: "Li Cha, you dare to beat the future gods in the eternal dragon temple, you are the dragon of eternity and time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, Li After checking the force at the foot, he had already stunned Ryan completely, then looked up at Xi Xi, and his eyes were cold. He said, "Oh, yes, I hit your gods again." He is "you." "This possessiveness has aggravated the tone, and it seems to be ridiculous and contemptuous,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richard spread his hand and said coldly, "How do I? Didn't see the punishment of the eternal and the dragon of time, hope, do you think about the meaning of the word divine guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;希His face was pale, and suddenly he raised his voice and shouted: "The guards killed the people in this dragon temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding dragon knights gathered around, But they are very hesitant, they can It was recognized by Richard, and instinctively felt that the orders of hope seemed to be inappropriate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Nolan took a big step forward. The knights said: "If you want to do anything, give me back. No one can point the weapon at the Lord Richard. Who dares to point the weapon at Richard, who is the blasphemy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Dragon Hall are in a dilemma. They don’t know who to listen to, they are in the same place,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is pale, to another The two great priests looked and asked, "What do you say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two great priests quietly stepped back and opened the distance with Greece. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard looked at him and said in a light voice: "I hope you don’t remember the meaning of divine guidance, do you want me? Help me remember the memories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the words of Richard, the face suddenly became pale, she finally remembered the true meaning of the word grace According to God's grace, Richard can not only distribute the grace of his own sacrifice, but also influence the acquisition of God's grace by others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to distribute God's grace, even if it is incomplete, means that Richard's importance in the longan of eternal and time is far more than the great gods of hope,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after she reacted, she discovered a very important thing that she just ignored. Those gods who wished to obtain it themselves would be promoted to the next level, but Nolan even rushed directly to the second. Tenth, what it means, hopes to feel an ice flow from the top of the head through the heart to the soles of the feet,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which is Richard’s favor or promise Lan’s patronage only shows one thing, that is, the position of the eternal and the dragon of time, the dragon of eternal and time has always been the most just, who is more useful, who will stand on one side,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry, raising his hand to the hope of a sigh of relief, only to hear a bang, and there is a sudden hourglass on the top of the head, and then broken, Most of them turned into nothingness, only a small part remained in the top of the Greek skull, and then slowly disappeared,<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the blood on the face of hope disappeared, pale as a dead person, and the voice trembled: "What have you done to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know very well, aren't you?" Richard's smile looks like a devil at this time,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently shaking, biting the lower lip, the lips are as pale as the meaningless color. Of course, she knows what Richard has done. Richard actually used the divine guidance on her and it took effect. The grace received by the sacrifice will be greatly reduced, and Nolan is now a sacred priest of the 20th level, and his position in the Dragon Hall is bound to increase substantially, and will definitely Became the head of the four great priests, and the chances of the Greeks presiding over the sacrifices will become even less. Under this circumstance, the path of the upgrade of hope will become distant,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are full of despair and resentment, and her finger joints that cling to the staff have not become a trace of blood, but there is no opening because Clearly knowing that this time is useless, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never thought that the title of Richard would actually increase to the extent of the space lord, at least she was The eternal dragon temple has never seen this speed for decades, and the dragon of eternal and time has such a preference for him, and the divine power guiding ability that can be given to the priest is actually unheard of. Even the gods of the temple have never heard of the right to have this kind of dragon eternal and timeless dragon spokesperson,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the only loophole in her plan, but it happened. In the past few years, the number of Richard sacrifices was too large, accounting for almost half of the entire eternal dragon temple. Was taken by the sand and Nolan, and now Vullen and the quicksand have left, and hope and the other two great priests are no longer willing to look at the grace of Nolan’s exclusive possession of Richard, so they have today’s forced palace,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked to the front of the Greeks, raised his hand, and deliberately stopped in the air, slowly extending to the chest of hope, hopes to bite the teeth The body keeps shaking, some want to hide, but still standing in the same place, letting Richard's hand put it up, Richard touched her chest and praised: "It's not small, so, although you I just wanted to push me to death, but I am very tolerant, I am willing to give you a chance. If you are willing to accompany me to bed, then I have not happened these things, and the divine guidance will be restored. How, of course, you don’t want to be okay, you will stay at level 18 forever, if you still If you do something further, it is possible to be driven out from here, so don't do more stupid things, but I have already reminded you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for her answer, she walked outside the Dragon Hall. Nolan looked at Xixi, but suddenly saw her eyes rekindled hope, and suddenly she was shocked. Nolan immediately chased after Richard. Going side by side with him,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan walked and asked: "Is the request you just mentioned is serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugged and said: "Of course it is serious. I can’t really kill her here. In that case, maybe the old dragon will be angry, just now. However, many people have seen it. From now on, she will never want to look up again in the Temple of Eternal Dragon. As for the upgrade, she does not even think about it. Anyway, she can’t really come to bed with me. This requires her. It will never be finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan eagerly said: "That is not necessarily, I think she will probably agree You just asked, and will come to you soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised: "This is not going to be, she is a big priest." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan at this moment appeared in the eyes of hope, and said: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He has only had a bitter smile,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the eternal and time dragons are really responsive to the people they choose. The additional skills that the divine guidance used for the priests are originally one-off, and there is no way to restore them. Perhaps the sacrifice can be, the intention of Richard. It is to let hope that there will be no further advancement, and it will not cause trouble in the future.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will never go to the old dragon when he is on the bed. The sacrifice to remove the restraint on the Greeks, the request to go to bed, just to humiliate her, but if she really put down the shelf, then Richard is equal to circumcising himself, although in other people's eyes, and hopes to go to bed should be Both the spirit and the body will be quite enjoyable,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return to Faro as soon as possible." Richard feels that the best way is to hide first. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Ryan and the other two great priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other two The great priest is very acquainted with the current affairs. I am not going to pursue it. As for Ryan, a little magician, He is self-defeating." Richard said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan frowned: "But Ryan had indeed had some harbingers of the gods, so hope He will put a heavy bet on him." She hesitated, not sure, "maybe there are other people there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dao: "It doesn't matter. He may have the possibility of becoming a gods before, but the dragon of eternal and time has just made it clear that Ryan certainly has no chance to become a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan silent for a moment, solemnly said: "Congratulations, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her heartfelt words, from the consequences of today’s conflict It can be clearly seen that Richard’s position in the longan of eternal and time has already surpassed these big gods, perhaps second only to the two real gods of Liusha and Vatican, like Ryan. The young divine sorcerer’s potential is also defeated, even the future is lost, without the full support of Richard. Nolan’s future in the Temple of Eternal Dragon must be very sad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not have much joy, sighed: “This is nothing remarkable, just in In the old longan, I am more useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important sacrifices, and the various episodes that follow, will be limited to a small circle. Secrets,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
