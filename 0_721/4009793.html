Look, of course, I hope she can be selected to leave this place. But this time... I have to say that perhaps her clean body is the greatest value to you, in addition, she really can't match the battle. A soul contract reel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has taken out the soul contract reel and said, "I have seen it, she may now carry the fourth order. Even the fifth-order structure, so it is no longer important to have blood circulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five-step construction?" Both Lina and Schiller Shock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is able to carry a fourth-order structure, indicating that the splash is likely to become a full third-order knight in the future. This is already Gordon Thirteen. The lowest level of the knight! If this is the case, then the huge advantage in the carrying capacity of the structure can completely offset the shortcomings of the lack of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the value of water is more than that of Gangde, it can be said that it is worth investing in a soul contract reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard did not explain all the observations. The current bearing capacity of the water flower is as high as 153, far exceeding the 80-120 bearing capacity required for a common fourth-order structure, which is only a little lower than the incredible 180 of the breaking sand. And the whole body of the water flower is almost shining with the magical radiance. Under the rough view, there are as many as eight positions on her body, which is even more than a position of seven of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The breaking sand of 'Dawning' is the oracle of the Eternal Dragon Temple. It is regarded as the character who can replace the Vatican in the future. It is totally uncommon. Inferred genius. The talent of the water flower in the construction load can be close to the flowing sand, which can be described as a enchanting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no more objections to Lina and Schiller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water splash, come over." Schiller waved a splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked at the three people with vigilance, but she had already heard their conversation and understood what was going on. So in hesitation and alertness, she began to approach carefully. This is her instinct to learn from the beast, and she has strong vigilance against all creatures with powerful power, no matter who they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller looked at the splash, his eyes were a bit complicated, and he said slowly: "In the future, you are the soul of Richard, and you don't have to stay here again." After becoming a soul guard, you are the second life of an adult, and you will share your destiny with adults. Therefore, no matter where you go, you must be like here, always remember to improve your strength until you can no longer improve. One day has come. In addition, this knife has been with me for many years, it is very suitable for you, just give it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Schiller untied The one-meter-long straight-bladed sword that was inserted in the back of the waist was thrown to the water. When the water was taken over, the first step was to step back in a lightning-fast manner. I carefully glanced at the students behind me and determined that no one had the intention of grabbing the handle. This took the handle and pulled out a blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a knife with a blade width of only three centimeters. The blade is black and black, and there is almost no reflection. But when the knife is off the sheath, there is a kind of turbidity and volatility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master Lina is also a master of appraisal, and immediately whispered: "Sinking gold! This is the guide of the eternal sleep!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also taken aback. Grit sanding gold is one of the higher grade materials than fine forged black iron. It is one of the best metals for making weapons. The sword that is made with it has twice the lethality of ordinary high carbon steel knives. Can carry two additional enchants. The knives in the hands of Shuihua are cast by the masters, and the four enchantments of ‘bleeding’, ‘tearing’, ‘enhanced sharpness’ and ‘running armor’ are added. The power can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the urging of Schiller, the splash finally came to Richard and sat down under the guidance of Lina. However, the distance so close clearly made her feel very uneasy. Looking at her nervous expression and her faintly stretched fingers, she could jump and hurt at any time. Now that the water flower "sleeper guide" is in the hand, it is so close, even Lina feels a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Lina continued to cast two serenity on the water, so that the wolf-like girl settled down a little. And Richard slowly unfolds the soul contract reel and recites it according to the established spell: "In the name of the dragon of eternal and time, connect my soul with the people in front of you..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mourning of the spell, the soul contract reel began to emit more and more intense golden light, and then disintegrated one inch and one inch into a flying sand, which gathered in the air into a golden cloud. . Shuihua slightly tilted her head, and some curiously looked at the group of magical sands that had their own lives. At this moment, she has no fear, but she has some faint expectations. A keen instinct made her feel that this was the moment to change her destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is complex and lengthy. At some point, all the golden sand particles suddenly converge into a golden stream of light, instantly rushing into the forehead of the water, condensing at her eyebrows Into a pale gold hourglass, the hourglass quickly reversed and then slowly disappeared. The water splashed low and the body fell softly. And Richard felt that for a moment, part of his soul was taken out of the body and disappeared into the deepest part of time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong feeling of weakness also hit the mind of Richard, so that he couldn’t help but step back two steps and then leaned into a warm and elastic embrace. . It turned out that Lina had been prepared and hugged him in time. For the result of using the soul summoning contract, Master Long is very clear. She took out two bottles of energy that had been prepared for a long time, handed it to Richard, and poured a bottle of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the potion, Richard felt that his physical strength was slowly rising, which was better. At this time, in his consciousness, the position of the splash can be clearly felt, and even her fuzzy mood swing can be perceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who was medicated slowly woke up, just regained consciousness, she bounced out of Lina’s arms, and then 'sleeper guide’ Out of the sheath, look around with vigilance. Richard can feel that she does not understand why she has just lost consciousness, so she is instinctively searching for unknown enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly looked at Richard with surprise and apparently felt the effectiveness of the soul contract. Through the soul contract, Richard sent the past to comfort her. She finally calmed down, put the long knife into the sheath, and slowly approached Richard. The power of contract makes Richard's breath the safest and calmest in her perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller made a long sigh of relief and said, "You have picked the right soul guard. Now let's leave this place, I heard your next trip. Still very nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded, turned and just about to leave, suddenly the ground shook, and then there was a thunderous scream: "Hey! This young master! I admit that the little girl is very powerful, but I am also a German Not bad! At least she can't beat me now! Look at my big hunger and thirst! How rough it is! My big axe will never let you down!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the big Han Gangde running down the road, Richard stopped. The splash is full of vigilance and stepping forward, grasping the guide of the long sleep in the hand, with this powerful long knife, she is not afraid of Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and said to Schiller: "I want to take this person away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Schiller indulged and said: "Although the order I received was to give you a defender, it is not impossible to take one away according to the usual practice. The Marquis of Gordon will give some extra compensation. But I need Remind you that the people who come out of the death camp have no loyalty, only strong forces can make them temporarily convinced. My suggestion is the magic slavery contract, you will find that this investment is worthwhile."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and turned to the rude, but consciously stopped at fifteen meters, and did not try to enter the dangerous melee distance of Gangde, asked: "That Are you willing to bear the magic slavery contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangdehaha smiled and said: "If this is a proof of loyalty, then I am willing! As long as I can leave this damn Place, as long as you can kill on the real battlefield, let me do anything! Look This rough giant axe, it has already been..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! I know!" Richard immediately interrupted him and said to the Dragon Master: "Lina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ready." Lina took out a dark magic scroll and threw it to Gangde. Gangde unfolded the reel without hesitation, inspiring the power of the reel, and a black gas instantly penetrated into his chest. The intense pain only made him lick his mouth slightly. Another small black color did not enter Richard's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic slavery is a rare and precious scroll. With this contract, Richard can feel the pain of being enslaved by his own mind, even by Heavy hit. And if Richard is dead, then the power of all creatures with magical slavery effects will be permanently reduced. For Noland, whose power is everything, this is an almost unbearable severe punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of magical slavery is far less powerful than the soul contract, but it is also a very effective means of restraint. This time, the core team of the Richards plane tour will be controlled by the magic slavery contract. Of course, sand drift is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina did not relax. After seeing the completion of the contract, she carefully examined Gangde with soul magic, confirmed that the contract was effective, and then Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde excitedly raised a huge axe and yelled at the other participants in the death camp: "The reptiles! Your good days have finally arrived, I am a German I am going to leave this damn place soon! You no longer have to fear my great axe, praise your luck! Hahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the roar Gangde, Richard suddenly felt some headaches and said to Schiller: "Is this your best recommendation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the perspective of combat effectiveness Yes, of course, except for the water splash." Schiller said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
