			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three hours of continuous march. The mountains of the northern part of the country finally appeared on the horizon, but Richard only encountered one attack, and easily repelled the opponent, leaving them more than 30 bodies. Then from the night to the next day, the day is clear and safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the team came to the foot of the mountain, Richard did not feel frowning, staring at the blood-stained land in the south, silent for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, why don't you go?" Gangde stood beside Richard and asked, while he untied the water bag, shook it hard, then drank a few Big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A familiar suffocating sighs, the horse's blood is contained in the water bag, and now it is already semi-condensed, and the taste is particularly irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let everyone rest on the ground, we wait for the enemy." Richard said. So the soldiers have dismounted and sit on the ground. Many people fall down and fall asleep. The legal staff are taking time to meditate to restore their mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still thinking. Countless thoughts are tumbling in my mind, and there are countless inferences and results in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the completion of that tactical turn, the follow-up to the Red Cossack has become extremely strange. But regardless of the purpose, it is ostensibly beneficial to Richard. As the number of encounters is reduced, the team can get enough rest, and the attackers are not high-spirited, which reduces the team's damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly squinted, overlooking the mountains in the north, what is waiting for him in front? Then the eyes swept over the meteorite forest standing in the southeast of the blood-stained land. No one would have thought that it was his real destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Richard began to be alert to the red Cossack wolves, he changed his strategy in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his plan, the Red Cossack warrior was consumed to the greatest extent by sports battles, and then returned to the bloodstone camp along the eastern boundary of the blood-stained land. The nest is still active in the vast unmanned mountainous area. It has become the hegemon of the area. The number of wind teeth has accumulated to hundreds, and many of the Warcraft equivalent to the 12th and 3rd levels have changed under the wolves. The food that becomes the mother's nest is transformed into a head. With the increase in the number of eating and producing wind teeth, the distance between the nests has not been upgraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be in the bloodstone camp near the mountainous area, entangled all the power, and the red Cossacks will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just in the recent night, the war seems to have started to change again. Richard closed his eyes hard, driving away the distracting thoughts in his mind and focusing on entering the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the most important thing is the next encounter, there is no tactical accumulation of advantages, how to talk about the realization of strategic goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is two hours. The soldiers under Richard’s men have already finished their rest, and even have time to eat the roasted horse meat, and the physical strength has recovered. Until then, Richard saw the smoke coming from the distant horizon, and a group of knights rushed in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are running sideways, not going straight to Richard. Until the guy at the tip of the eye saw the anomaly here, the team's cavalry cavalry screamed. A few kilometers apart, they stopped and confronted Richard. For a moment, they did not know whether they were going to charge directly or split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation was the first time in more than ten days of fighting. Richard’s team was also fully rested for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed the opposite of the stables, and then recalled the last battle, the 300-strong team lost only one-tenth of the battle and hurriedly retreated. Richard suddenly showed a smile and pointed to the opposite horse. He said, "Let us go and drive them away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers immediately got up, the barbarian Forming a neat line, starting to move forward, the two-wing cavalry began to split to the left and right. As long as they get the chance, these sand people will bite their opponents like a hungry wolf, so that the wolves have a chance to catch up and even tear up their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse was obviously flustered, and finally whistle before entering the range, and turned around and ran. Because what they see is no longer a weary prey, but a beast that recharges and recharges. Past experience tells them that the 500-person cavalry is facing the team that Richard has completed, and there will be no second ending except for the defeat of the big numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in command between the leaders of Salenville and the Red Cossack Guard was revealed one day after the replacement of the commander. The consequences of the large-scale war damage against morale blows also broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has continued to head north with a well-rested team. Although he set the battleground in the bloodstone camp, the exploration of the mountainous areas of the Iron Triangle Empire, It is equally important to him, and it is worth trying if there is an opportunity. He meditated on horseback and repeatedly played the last few encounters, then revealed a light smile. "It seems that our opponent has changed, good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know what happened, the mysterious hand that manipulated the many wolves to accurately intercept the interception apparently disappeared, and the red Cossack returned to the earliest sand-like safari level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very encouraging news. The red Cossack’s hunting has gone from loose to meticulous, and it has become loose. What is behind it, what conspiracy exists, right? It is not important for Richard now. As long as the core strength of the team is preserved and the mountain is successfully entered, the exploration of the Xiepide family is the greatest victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous and rigorous battle beyond imagination, like a hammer, constantly striking Richard, making his heart and will continue to become harder. Now that there is a natural majesty between Richard's gestures, his words are still not much, but concise. And the handsome face that was originally inherited from the blood of the elf, gradually revealed the feeling of rough and rough, no longer the exquisiteness of the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sand sand, do you feel anything?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have now successfully entered the mountainous areas of the Iron Triangle Empire, and they have also verified the judgment of Richard’s previous changes in the strength of the Red Cossacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand hand holds the book of time, and a pale gold hourglass floats on the page, which is slowly rotating. She stared at the hourglass and then pointed to the northwest and said, "In that direction, there was a strong time and space fluctuation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let's look at the past Look." Richard waved, then led the team and disappeared into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, on a gentle slope, the soldiers set up a camp, ignited a bonfire, and a warhead was hunted by the river. Wash and peel off, then bake on the fire. When the aroma of the barbecue began to delay, the camp burst into cheers! They haven't taken a bath for ten days, and they have clean water, let alone a bite of hot oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
