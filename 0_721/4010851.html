It’s legendary. If you want to hide strength in his real vision, unless it’s a superpower, it’s possible, but there are only a handful of superpowers on the mainland, and whoever’s going to run deep blue,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the source of danger should be just a very ordinary mage, and there is no hidden power,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lower level mage can threaten Li There is only one possibility to check: the scholar mages, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped. The invisible force field is instantaneously emitted from the center of itself. In the meantime, more than a dozen mages around him have paralyzed or weak effects, and they can no longer move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the transmission platform, there was a burst of exclamation, and the Masters did not understand what happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with both hands and said, "Quiet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing, let me go," one of the mages couldn’t help but ask aloud, but Richard waved a silence on him and made him completely quiet. Going on,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the wizards are looking at Richard with fear, and now the identity of the legendary Master of Richard is already open, not at all they can compete,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around the mages who fell to the ground and said faintly: "You have a scholar mage, no, don't rush to tell me that you are innocent, dark blue The great magisters will have a way to prove your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young mage asked in a loud voice: "You are talking about the Solomon Fort Scholar Master. How are you going to treat them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and said, "Given the Solomon Fort Scholars What I did, once I found out that they appeared in the dark blue, then...kill the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Master, look I still want to say something, but when I touched Richard’s eyes, I immediately chilled and didn’t dare to say a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master rushed in After asking about the incident, I ordered the masters to take them all away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master took a deep look at Richard and saw the location of Richard’s invisible Nodding, I know that he has made up his mind, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most mages, Solomon's scholars are a terrible behemoth, many secrets of ancient inheritance. And habitually hidden in the secular and sinister practices, making these scholars as dangerous and deadly as vipers, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on the other hand, mysterious in many wizards Solomon Castle is also the holy land of the secret law, the same is the decoration, the magical suit of Solomon Castle is the god of the wizards. However, Richard is only a new sacred architect. He has not yet produced a top-level sacred costume that truly claims to be a sensational continent. Naturally, Solomon Castle, which has been inherited for nearly a thousand years, is not on the same level.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Master Phil’s encounter with Solomon Fort became extremely cautious and he had to reconfirm Richard’s determination, but since Richard made up his mind, Phil Master would not hesitate anymore,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that these low-level mages were taken away, Richard hesitated, or walked into the transmission circle and left the dark blue. With the strength of Su Helun, it is no longer a conspiracy. Being able to get rid of it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Faro, after a series of transmissions, Richard finally sat in his own office in the Dragon Valley, he threw himself into In the large sofa, I covered my eyes with my hands and kept thinking about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conflict made him see more clearly the strength between himself and the indeterminate The gap, and more importantly, once it is up, even if Su Helun can't stop her from killing Richard, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing extraordinary speed and combat skills The combination, almost no solution, perhaps only the power of Su Helun and Philip is strong enough to suppress everything Or someone like Vanine, who controls the transcendental rules, can defeat the indefinite, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is no intention to kill Richard, but Lee I can't forget the dark purple eyes,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been thinking for a long time, and has simulated thousands of battles without a fixed scene, but every time It was a fiasco, and she couldn’t even catch a single blow. When there was no way to break out, Richard couldn’t even respond to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt bored Jumping out of the sofa, grabbing a bottle of spirits on the wine cabinet, knocking out the bottleneck with force, and pouring a half of the bottle in one breath, then vomiting the alcohol, muttering, and then force the bottle Throwing to the wall,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken glass splashes everywhere, there are a few pieces that are still on Richard’s face, then they are collapsed, but the eyes are licking Don’t hesitate,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushing a bottle, Richard feels better than some, like the accumulation in the chest After disappearing, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door was ringing, and Richard stood still and did not move. He said, "Come in.",<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room is the fairy poet Olal, who saw the mess in the room, suddenly shocked,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I'm fine, let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Richard." Oral activated the magic map of the entire Faro, the recent law Luo’s situation is concise and concise, once again, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month before Richard’s return, Sinai’s Kingdom of God finally collapsed,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep night sky, the burning godland is like a huge meteor across the sky, disappearing into the deepest part of the night,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The fall of Sinai has shaken the whole of Faro. On the mainland, the churches of the gods have changed their attitudes, showing to the three goddesses, and maintaining neutrality and non-contact, but there are no more apparently hostile churches. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mainland, Gangde’s expeditionary army has firmly occupied the estuary of the East Coast and has annihilated the last of the coastal countries in several wars. The army, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde, who returned to the army, wiped out the most fierce resistance of more than a dozen Principalities and a kingdom, and took the royal family The pulse is all killing, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Gangde is exploring the deep-water port on the east coast, ambitiously trying to detect what is opposite the storm ocean, that is the law In the history of Luo, there has never been a record of uninhabited places.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is endless, even the agents of the Faro gods in the world will be The deterrence is the extremity of the forbidden zone of God, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the bald man of Gangde is brutal and violent, the more the god’s restricted area, the more he wants to explore the past. In the meantime, during the time when Richard was not there, Gangde had already pondered a lot of plans and even established contact with the mother nest to see if he could get a few giant sea animals that could cross the ocean,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral handed over a few more sheets and said, "This is what Gangde has given you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard took a look, he was very happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde really dared to think about it, and wanted to ask for a few ships from the vast green continent. Ship in France, and then with a brood of Marine Mammals and air war beast, consisting of a combined fleet, the expedition of the other side of the Ocean of Storms, <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Even if the risk is too great, Gangde has found an alternative solution, the famous cruiser fleet, who will lead the fleet to patrol the coast south to conquer all forces that are not willing to surrender,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of this letter, Gang Deqiang strongly said: "Whoever conquered the ocean, who conquered the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard laughed and cried, took a few sheets of paper in his hand and said to Oral: "You have seen this letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Elf poet answered honestly,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given it to me after seeing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can't do anything, Gangde said, if I don't pass this letter to you, he will have a good fight with me. You know, I am just a bard and shooter. How is it possible? He beat him like a bald man." Oral said with a bitter face, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helplessly, his hand ignited a blue fire, and put the Gangde The letter burned into gray, < Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical ship, which is the product of the most prosperous period of the Elven Empire, this 1300-meter-long behemoth has incredible power and is the pinnacle of magical civilization. It is enough to be in the same name as the structure, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the ancient empire lasted more than three hundred years, but only seven magical ships were built, these seven giant ships Forming an unprecedented fleet, after several years of exploration, it has killed 19 deep-sea legendary beasts and finally found the Cangqing continent, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the high elf warriors on the fleet The entire Qingqing continent, killing the indigenous people, turning the whole continent into an overseas enclave of the elf empire,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Noland’s elf empire died, high The elves retreated to the vast green continent and blocked the ocean with a magical ship, so that they could be preserved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a thousand years ago, only seven magical ships were left. The next three, the elves of the green continent can no longer build a new magic ship,<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention that it is impossible for Richard to get the magical giant ships of the high elves, even if they get it, how to move them to Faro,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
