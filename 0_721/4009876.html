			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally struggled to stand up, his hips were burning Fortunately, I can still move, indicating that the injury is not heavy. He reached out and touched it, only to find that the clothes had broken, and then the hands were wet and hot. Put your hand in front of your eyes and see that it is full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water Splash!" Richard was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s body trembled but did not move, only when she heard nothing. There is no expression on her face, just like this, it shows that her heart is not calm. Although the girl has very few words and expressions, she rarely has a frozen face. Most of the time, she used the hunter to look at the prey's eyes and observe the world around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel tried to move, it’s still good, the injury will not affect the action, at most it is a small flesh and blood injury, a treatment can be solved It is. Even if you don't use magic, after three or five days, the wound will heal naturally. The question is, how does this injury open to the sand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can even imagine that once you let the sand know this thing, I am afraid it will become a joke in the future. If one day he becomes a well-known figure in the mainland, such as a holy constructor, then this woman will probably write a book called the secret history of the sacred architect, and then write this in, In order to let her own stories spread through the ages, by the way, she can also be famous. And with her time and the eternal dragon gods, let alone the eternal, it is possible to have this book with the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Li sighed and treated the wound briefly, determined to let it heal naturally. Then I gnashed my teeth and went to the water, continued to check her body, and perfected some of the details in the concept. Once he started working, Richard gradually left behind the episode, immersed in the world of architecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard suddenly went crazy and disrupted all the facilities in the room, placed several chairs in the center as obstacles, and then let the girl demonstrate her The special ability is popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water splashes like a ghost, the speed is getting faster and faster, all the obstacles are no longer hindered, sometimes it becomes her Location or defend your own shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment she is completely **, so every change in movement, the relaxation of every inch of skin is clearly displayed in front of Richard. The girl's body constitutes a wonderful cycle between tension and Shufa. She spends most of her time relaxing and stretching, relying on inertia to fly in the air, then gradually tightening her contracture, and then gently at the next stop, so In the beautiful body, a powerful force is emanating, and the whole person, such as the hunting wolf, is ejected again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is silent, and the darkness embraces the girl as always. The dark night and the complicated environment are the world of girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last missing inspiration was completed, and Richard waved the water to stop, let her lie down on the bed, and then even had time to ignite the magic light, a direct illumination The room lit up and then grabbed the magic pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was lying on her back in bed, and Richard held a magic pen and stabbed a beautiful and complex line on her calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed quietly in the silence, the magic pen changed for one branch, and the refined magic material was also turned into a pattern on the girl's legs. An hour has passed, and the lighting has gradually failed. Richard just added a lighting technique and still refuses to spend a few more seconds to ignite the magic light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
