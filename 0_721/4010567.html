			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scratching his head, the ogre finally couldn’t help but ask: "You It is... from where to learn to fight the iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just learned a few days ago." The girl's hammer is still spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is this something still Lafite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously not."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, anyway, it is no longer Lafite Fine iron." A drop of girl's sweat dripping, falling on the red iron block, stirred up a white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The human being is just an ordinary blacksmith, I can be sure that he can teach you not to play this thing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in fact, I don't know what to play, just don't want to go to bed again." The girl licked her head, and a drop of sweat fell on the red iron block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed familiar with his own one-eyed, finally confirmed that there is a strange power in the sweat of the girl, and absorbed by the iron block Under the repeated hammering of the girl, the volume of the fine iron has been reduced to a slightly invisible point. The girl picks up a piece of fine iron ingot, throws it on the anvil, puts the hammer in the furnace, and puts the bear furnace When the fire is sucked up and the hammer falls, all the forces are poured into the fine iron ingot, and the iron ingot is reddish in an instant, blending with the piece of iron that is tempered, and then it is constantly hammering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu continues: "I think this thing is largely based on your strength, why not directly infuse power, such as pouring When I go to the blood, I bet the process of making it can be cut in half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea sighed and said: "Shortening the process, why? There are not many ingots. After I have finished these, what can I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be a little unhappy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea hammered the red iron ingot and said faintly: "No unhappy, just a little...can't find the direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Direction, our direction is not to follow the head," Tiramisu said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, there is no direction now." The girl hammered the iron piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the distant singer came to the horn of Elliott’s army. Tiramisu cocked his ears and listened, and Weng said with anger. "The little red-haired girl is rallying the army, are we going to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea look at the remaining pieces of fine iron ingots, Shaking his head: "Don't go, I will finish these pieces of iron ingots and wait until they have finished meeting and join them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I Don't go, let's make up for another nap." Then, the ogre's body leaned back and leaned against the big tree behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the base city, hundreds of knights have been arranged in a neat team, quietly standing, the whole body is covered with Ai Lizhen, sitting face, face Very unsightly, she has been waiting here for half an hour, but the twilight, tiramisu and the mountains and the sea have not appeared. These are the powerful followers that Richard has confessed. As for Qi Qi, she certainly does not. In the ranks of the expedition, no family will be extravagant to let the builders go to the battlefield, unless the builder is in some special circumstances, such as the need to combat experience to upgrade the level of the Master, like Richard’s time to rush in the first A big line of architects can indeed be said to be an alternative, or straightforward, it is a metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a strong and majestic general came to come to Ellie and asked: "The Earl, it’s been a long time now, are we I have to wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other general also snorted and said coldly: "The lords' followers are really big. Actually, I don’t listen to the call of the military. If I change my personal, I can cut my head after half an hour. This kind of military discipline really doesn’t know how the lord is trained.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The two generals have a lot of dissatisfaction in their words, and there is a arrogance that has long been used by the crickets of the battlefield. However, at this time, a construction knight suddenly came out of the queue, against the two generals. He said: "What do you think of the Lord and his followers? If you don't come to the evaluation, please close my mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals suddenly looked pale and blue, and one person said with anger: "There is no way to interrupt you here. You know what to do when you fight. Don't think that you are a knight, you are a personal thing. When you follow the Earl of the South, you still have a war. I don't know where it is, I have the ability to fight on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is not convinced, sneer: "Hey, I think this is a good idea. We are here too... Oh, three hundred to build a knight, nothing at all, I remember that Earl was originally a dozen or so knights, that bearded, we really won’t fight, it will only be hard Rush, if you want to give you 5,000 people, we are on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals’ faces are already black, they think of this here. The knights are all part of Richard, even if some of them are placed under the command of Alice, but once there is a dispute, they will return to Richard’s majesty, more than 300 knights, although the Qiqi Knight is more than normal. Poor, and barely able to get the threshold of the knight What are the concepts of more than 300 knights, which means that their cluster charges can't be stopped, let alone 5,000 people, that is, 10,000 people can't stop their chiseling assaults, and then elite troops are repeatedly pierced. After two or three times, it will also be chaotic and collapsed. Ten thousand people are just a little bit difficult for more than three hundred knights. There is no suspense in defeating. In fact, in recent years, they can defeat the knights with ordinary knights. Richard is just one person, but Richard’s squadron is actually a war machine that is uncompromising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li婕 frowned and said: "All returned to the team, Richard has given all the command to me, don't you know?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who was out of the building looked at Ellie and said coldly: "The Earl, we used to listen to your command and command, but I think, The scope of this order should not include doubts about the lord. As long as you control your mouth, we will obey the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the return of the horse, the knight suddenly turned back and sneered at the two generals: "You have not seen the power of the lord followers. In front of them, your poor battlefield experience is not enough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals were extremely ugly, but under the gaze of Ellie’s gaze, they were forced to endure no seizures, and their individual strengths were not as strong as the knights. Quite, not to be known for killing themselves, but they are not surrounded by ordinary troops. The experience of the strong, so there is not much respect for the strong individual who is only strong in individual strength, and most of the architects under his command have the experience of fighting side by side with the followers, so I know that the followers of Richard are not ordinary. In the sense of the strong, in the battlefield of the plane, Tiramisu, sand, water, Gangde, fighting the gods Iyo, Naiyou, this one name, in the eyes of the enemy is synonymous with nightmares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't wait, the whole army set off." Ellie slammed her hand and ordered the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of knights rides the magic ride, heading for the forest, a sacred unicorn that is more than half the head of the magic ride jumps out of the forest Into the ranks, this is Richard's unicorn, after deep into the forest, it will be responsible for providing protection for the entire force, against the suppression of the will of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred unicorn sits on the back of the water, the girl holds a long knife and leans against the unicorn’s neck, she is the first to appear Followers, but some of the generals under Ellie’s eyes were staring at her. One reason was that her posture was too casual, not like in the army, and the other was the original unicorn. When it appeared, Ellie had wanted to ride, but it was shocked by this unicorn, and it was almost seriously injured. Now, this unicorn has a splash on the back, and in contrast, Ellie naturally gives Compared to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little sleepy water that suddenly felt something, opened his eyes, his eyes swept over several generals, and he fell asleep again. The generals were swept away by her eyes. Suddenly they fell like hail, and they were all stiff. One couldn’t even control themselves. One of them was planted from the battle. Ellie leaped into the horse without saying a word. It was up, and my face sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These generals are very effective in fighting, but the individual force is not how outstanding, only a sanctuary, and the water flower follows Richard to kill the whole battlefield. In the past five years, until the tempering and perfection of the war, it has entered the sanctuary. At this moment, the combat power has already been strong and abnormal. The ordinary sanctuary is a dish that has been turned over by a few knives. Where these generals can stop her murderousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a trouble, several generals will be quiet, but the atmosphere in the team has dropped to freezing point, and Ellie’s eyebrows are wrinkled and her heart is extremely It’s unpleasant. She already knew that the followers of Richard’s majesty were very strong, but they didn’t expect to be strong enough. These followers were unruly one by one. They only had one person in the eyes, but they never did. Put her in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team follows the direction of Richard and does not go to the direction of the Yongye tribe. When they leave the city, Richard has come to Yong. Under the tree of life of the night tribe, I was watching several elf warriors in front of myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the soldiers bowed and said, "Mr. Richard, the Presbyterian Church is holding a meeting, and now you can’t enter the tribal territory, I am sorry."
