It is said that the baron is nominally the distant scorpion of the Marquis of Little Blatter, but it is actually the illegitimate son of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frown asked: "What is Narom doing inside? He doesn't know how to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of Richard before the departure of the people is that if someone blocks it as an enemy of Archimonde, he can immediately fight. He sent out small and powerful teams. If you deal with the general aristocracy, you can go straight to the Chinese army and kill the commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Romney, there were also two groups of people who were intercepted by other nobles, but they did not change the same way and slammed into the intercepting army of the other side. Just when the two sides would collide, the two nobles finally dared not break out with Archimonde and chose to give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Roma is barely a heavenly sanctuary. Recently, he has got two dragon tooth daggers. The strength is slightly stronger than other teams. How is it? Stopped? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already begun to be somewhat dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers said: "The attitude of the other party is very tough and not afraid to fight with us. The Marquis of Sisby is the cousin of the Duke of the Iron Age, in the Holy Alliance. One of the strengths of the nobility. In addition, he is very dissatisfied with the practice of your all-night scholar mage, and it is said that his favorite son has joined the scholar mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Another knight came in and said, "His Royal Highness, Romney sent a message, and the Marquis of Sisby has surrounded them. He is ready to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard nodded and asked a black robe mover behind him: "Where is Sisby's son now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black robe mage It has connections with many gray sè organizations. When she hears about Richard's problems, she also has a hard time: "This is the secret of the Royal Highness. The scholar's whereabouts are secret. He may be in front of us, just changing his identity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood up and said, "Let's go, I think the Marquis of Sisby should know the whereabouts of his son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to the military account In addition, the followers and the strong men were summoned, and then a huge portal was created in the air, and they first went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard also followed them one by one, but then the strong followers of Richard were sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large portal that can remotely transfer multiple people? But neither the preparation process for constructing the array nor the signs of using artifacts made it simple to create a portal that looked simpler than the random transmission of the wizard. This has subverted magical common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful players in the heart also walked into the portal one by one, and when they walked out of the portal, they found it was hundreds of kilometers away. In the air. On the ground below, tens of thousands of military regiments surrounded dozens of people in the middle, and the situation was already on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Military Office, the Marquis of Sisby was arrogant in the crowds of several Sanctuary strongmen, but at the moment it was like a gray, dull look The huge portal in midair, watching one strong and one strong coming out of the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a portal of this size appear here? The Marquis of Sisby can't figure out anyway, even the legendary mage who specializes in space can only send himself. If you want to transfer multiple people from a long distance, you can either prepare a super large-scale array at both ends or hold an artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such artifacts are said to have only one of the Millennium empire in the entire Noland, and it will not be used several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Sisby suddenly felt the whole body chilling. If this is the portal created by Richard, how much has Richard’s strength reached? Is he already a super strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down on Sisby’s army in the air, and tens of thousands of troops were filtered out in his eyes, leaving only a total of seven Sanctuary strongmen. Even 30 builder knights are ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the eyes of Richard, the seven sacred strongmen suddenly face like a sè, one by one shrinking into their own battle, light It’s like watching them, they know that the war is going together. They don’t just run away and they’ve been thankful. It’s impossible to expect them to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Sisby raised his voice and barely cried: "Richard! You are killing the lord at will, and you have violated ancient traditions and rules. You are against all nobles! Even if you are strong, this is also a dead end. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Marquis and asked calmly: "Is it finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sith The face of the face suddenly becomes pale, and the calmer the attitude of Richard, the more he understands the determination. No matter what kind of traditions and rules can't stop Richard's determination to revenge, at this moment, whoever blocks in front of Richard, who will be crushed mercilessly by the horrible war machine of Archimonde! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis turned back subconsciously, trying to find the gray robe mage, the gray robe mage who gave him countless help and guidance in the past few months. . He is also a good friend of the Marquis son, wise and profound, with his help, the Marquis's territory flourished and prospered, and the two jazz collars were annexed. This interception is also a proposal of the Master of Grey Robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Marquis turned back, he found that there was no such figure in the gray robe! He was so cold all the time, only to remember that the mysterious gray robe mage had left him yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis turned back and looked at Richard in despair. He saw that Richard’s eyes were all calm and there was no trace of emotional fluctuations. Moreover, the focus of Richard’s gaze is not on him, but on the distant sky. His gaze penetrated a lot of space, I don't know what to look at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sisibi suddenly realized that even if there are a thousand 10,000 reasons to prove that Richard will not do it, but as long as there is a reason, Richard Will not hesitate to make a war. That reason is, His Highness Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, wait a minute! Don't do it! I will withdraw the army, and this will withdraw the army!" The Marquis' voice was panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, he finally had an expression and glanced at Sisby and said, "Want to withdraw? You can. Give your son out, then you Self-discipline, you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis said: "But I don't know where he is. He left the family a few years ago and went out to take risks! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, then you have nothing to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sisibi cried in despair: "Richard, you can't kill me! I am the Duke of Iron and Blood." The cousin, if you kill me, the Duke of Iron and Blood will never let you go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, there is a sarcasm, saying: "Orleans Your Highness will not turn over my face for you with such an idiot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, Lee raised his hand to Sisby. His fingertips illuminate a little blue sè, and then a blue fire shines out of the light, and shè is on Sisby. The blue fire suddenly rose, and in a few seconds, the Marquis and his mount were burned together into a small set of white ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rohme, continue your mission." After the command, Richard opened the huge portal again and left with the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefields below, Sithby’s tens of thousands of private troops are fleeing, but Richard has no interest in killing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the death of Sisby spread throughout the Holy Alliance, and later, throughout the Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the aristocrats who were passionately excited suddenly fell silent, and no one stood up and blamed anything. Sisby’s embers let them understand how much Richard’s determination was. If you want to obstruct Archimonde at this time, it is an endless war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lords do not always act according to their interests, they also have their own principles and pride. But for some ancient unspoken rules to jump out and apparently already crazy about Archimonde, it is not glory, but stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, this can be said to be another kind of blood relative revenge, but the momentum is huge. Some big lords also persuaded themselves and waited for new opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the six-story floating island of the Holy Alliance, the Duke of Iron and Blood sits in the study, his face is sizzling. There was an urgent report in front of him, which was the news of the death of the Marquis of Sisby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several people standing in the study, some of whom are outstanding younger generations of the family, and some are family elders. White Night and Agamemnon are also impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Iron and Blood gently tapped the table and said after a while: "Sithby is my cousin, but the relationship with me has always been close. Now that something like this, what do you think?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man of similar age to Agamemnon stepped forward and said, "Father, Richard is a contempt and insult to our naked family!" His words have now spread throughout the upper class. The honor of our family has been obviously damaged. If you do not take measures against him, I am afraid that in the next few decades we will become the laughing stock of the upper class! So I suggest, let Richard immediately apologized for compensation, otherwise he would fight Archimonde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Agamemnon said coldly: "Do not fight Win.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face swells immediately: “Look at the position under our feet! We are the only floating island giant after the royal family, in all other Above the floating island giants. What is Richard, yes, he has a lot of strong people now. It’s about the legendary powerhouse, and our iron-blooded family is no less than him. What's more, the people under him are just some guys who see money, and can they be somewhat loyal to Archimonde? As long as we are in the middle of the army, they naturally It will be chaotic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon rarely said a useless word: "nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The young man almost spurted out the fire, staring at Agamemnon, gnashing his teeth: "Agamemnon, what do you mean? Father just made you a heir, but you have not yet taken the homeowner. The position is handed over to you. You are starting to glory. I know that your relationship with Richard is good, but it is not good enough to take the honor of the whole family of irons as a source for you to give him a fart/share. ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon still has no expression on his face, but his hand moves to the hilt of his waist. For him, this is already a sign of extreme anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS1: Hey, come back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS2: Thanks to the new lord Solomon Scholar Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS3: This week's "Sin City" added 6 new lords, one lord to advance, plus two ally of the week... let 俺 put the head on the table Look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to all the lords, thank all the brothers and sisters who came to read the genuine, cast flowers, top, vote and seal, let the list go to hell, this The rest of the month is rì, unconditional double. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
