			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked past Nolan, I suddenly turned my head and looked around. She glanced at it, and for some reason, when she came into contact with the faceless face, Nolan suddenly felt that the indescribable ice cold rose from the bottom of her heart. For a time, she was completely stiff and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face just looked at Nolan, and took back his eyes, followed Richard to the outside of the temple until her figure disappeared on the broad stepped edge outside the temple. Nolan recovered his ability to act and immediately sweated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Eternal Dragon Hall, Richard summoned the knights to walk to the floating island of Archimonde, and naturally rides on Lee. Looking around, this time she didn't seem to cover up, but she was riding with Richard very broadly. On the way, she suddenly said to Richard: "The little priest just now, what is that Nolan? If you have the opportunity, give me more compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised and asked: "What happened to her."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face to understate: "Nothing, she lost a lot of grace this time, in fact, she is nothing left, and she is still a very smart little guy, know let You allocate more resources to me. If you get more out of God, it will be rewarded for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deeply helpless, this mysterious The faceless knight has a special style of independence and extreme arrogance. This time it is the same. Rewarding Nolan, she just moved her mouth, but the sacrifice was made by Richard. The hands of the police now has consumed the sacrifice was erased, even a low-level offerings are not left to the culprit, not just this faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time no face and said: "Oh yes, this is my ability, you see."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of information appeared directly in Richard’s consciousness. Richard was surprised to find that there is only one kind of ability to face the moment: the war madman, this ability can be said to be an upgraded version of the war, able to The range increases the speed, strength, defense, and the speed of vindictiveness and magic recovery, and is different from the war shackles that can only be used below the sanctuary, at most until the age of eighteen, and the war madman can be any of the legendary People are even magical things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability is put on the battlefield and will directly create a killing machine. The only limitation is that the war madman is a faceless exclusive ability. It can only be effective for one person at a time, and war is a magical technique. As long as the power is enough, I want to You can put it a few times to cast it a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But considering that no face is still only 16 levels, the ability to appear is quite speechless, so tyrannical ability, generally only appears in twenty On the big gods around the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impressed." Li said concisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a small bait, don't rush to swallow, this will make me look down on you." No face is very welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war madman is just a small bait, and Richard can’t help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just returned to the floating island, and a waiter greeted him and sent a letter with a conspicuous reminder to Richard’s hand. When I opened it, I suddenly saw my brows wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an invitation from the royal family. It is for all the owners of the floating islands. Please come to the floating island of the royal family tomorrow morning. Negotiation, as for what is important, but did not explain in the invitation letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this invitation, Richard didn’t know why, and suddenly there was a shadow in his heart. He had a hunch that seemed to be uneasy for a while, friends’ abnormalities. It should be answered at tomorrow's meeting, and that answer will not be pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle, he arranged a room for no face, and he returned to the cultivation room on the top of the floating island and began to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden seed swallowed, and immediately sprouted a heart bud inside the body, the position of the heart in the abdomen The two hearts that formed the original form a triangle, but the second heart that appeared not long ago is still in its nascent state. The energy light of Richard’s meditation is insufficient for the supply of this heart. Now suddenly there is another one. The heart is suddenly in a state of being unable to make ends meet, so that Richard now has time to meditate in order to keep the two newborn hearts growing normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the meditation of this night is not smooth, the heavy uneasiness is like a cyclone, and there is always no sign in the sea of ​​consciousness Over, to break the tranquility that should be, the result of restlessness, is that the star of the traction has repeatedly made mistakes, always escaping at the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get to the dawn. Richard used breakfast, and under the guard of a small team of knights, went to the floating island where the royal family is located. At 9:00 in the morning, the owners of the 14 floating island giants all attended, this is still Richard. For the first time, I saw all the floating island giants appear together. Nothing was missed. Even the Duke of Iron and Blood was personally present, instead of sending one of his sons as a representative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourteen giants are sitting in a special conference room in the palace. This conference room is simply furnished with only a small round table, regardless of the priority. The fourteen homeowners were slightly crowded, not to mention leaving the emperor with an extraordinarily large position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dome of the conference room, depicting the life of Charles the Great from the establishment of the Holy Alliance to the killing of the Abyssal Dragon Dala, this is also the meeting The only decoration of the room, the round table meeting room, left a strong stroke in the history of the Holy Alliance. In this conference room, Charles the Great met with his most powerful generals and set the benchmark covenant of the Holy Alliance. The generals were the original giants. Since then, only the most important meeting of the entire Holy Alliance will be held in this roundtable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ranking in the round table. When the meeting is held here, it means that the royal family will no longer be the monarch of the Holy Alliance, but only a member of the nobility. The nobles who appeared on this conference table are theoretically equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat in his seat and looked around. He saw that most of the wealthy homeowners were vaguely obscured. Only Wellingburg and the Iron and White Duke were among the top ranked The owner is not moving, it seems that there are counts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine o'clock, the door of the conference hall opened, the emperor of the Holy Alliance, the bloodthirsty Philip appeared at the door, and all the wealthy owners stood up. Ying, this is not because of the identity of the Philip Emperor, but because he has been alone in the rising sun, washing the great glory of the Holy League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips moved a huge body, squeezed into his seat, sat down first, then let the family sit down, long time no see, Richard found Philippine Lipu is getting fatter, and he will take up the position of four people by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Philip sat down, waved his hand and the courtier quit the conference hall and carefully closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly aware that there was a magical fluctuation in the position of the room that he could not lock the position, which is familiar to most mages: In vain, the magical array of sounds is isolated, and Richard’s heart sinks, and round-table meetings on the floating islands of the royal family also require anti-eavesdropping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, I have to discuss with you two things this time. The first one is about my body. I have to inform you that in the last twilight war, my injuries were hard to recover. So far, all the treatment efforts have failed. After a while, I may not even be able to maintain the power of the Sanctuary." Philip said calmly, the tone usually seems to be a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his words are like a huge meteorite falling from the sky, enough to make the whole Noland a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Battle of Dusk, Philip has hit the two super-powers of Dakosodas with one hand and killed a legendary strongman It has become the first of the Noord human powers. However, many people, including Richard, did not expect Philip to pay such a heavy price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of any superpower is a sensational event for the entire plane, not to mention that Philip is close to the station. The character who is at the top of the super strong, perhaps Charles, the founding emperor of the Holy League, is just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the round table room was suddenly suppressed, and it was so heavy that it was breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the entire Holy Alliance, the loss of a super-powerful, the consequences are not as simple as it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole sacred alliance can be called the super strong, except the emperor Philip, perhaps only the legendary mage Su Hailun, and the eternal dragon temple Three people of the Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Vatican is limited to the Eternal Dragon Hall, must maintain a neutral position, it is almost impossible to directly shoot for the Holy League, and Su Helun is actually not known. It can be worthy of the battle experience of the super strongman. In recent years, the legendary mage has been exploring in the depths of the plane most of the time. No one knows to what extent her true strength is, just knowing that she never seems to have Defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Su Hailun has been seriously injured, and the news of falling asleep is gradually spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these three people, although the strength of the Duke of Iron and Blood is far above the ordinary legend, he himself has always thought that it is a little worse than the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
