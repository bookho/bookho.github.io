			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice of Richard came: "Sit for another three days, we rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Three days," Freire screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then five days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulei’s body trembled, no longer dare He made a sound and sat down honestly. She always had a natural fear of Richard, not only because of the power of Richard, but also because Richard had the breath of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the deterrent of Freire's breath, Richard's fleet went all the way, and finally, after five days of flight, finally arrived at the plane, one only The flying dragonfly passes through the plane channel one by one and appears in another abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new abyss does not look much different from the previous one. Richard observed a change in the rules here, and then pointed to one direction, the entire fleet. Then he turned and flew in the direction pointed out by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long it takes to determine the position." Goshawk asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the footprints of the saints in front of him and said, "Come on, and then go through two layers of abyss to determine our position."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godhawk nodded and said, "Well, I am going to catch a few demons to study and come back three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet of Richard continued to fly, and everything was no different from the upper abyss. However, seven days later, when the plane was about to arrive, there was finally a dark red tide like the demon army in front of the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This abyss is a big lord, and Richard finally meets the demon army that guards the plane, even if the big lord is not in this army. But, these demons are no longer afraid of the atmosphere of Freire, even if Richard releases the breath of the big lord, I am afraid it is difficult for them to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the abyss of the great lord, Richard is not free to release the breath of his own great lord, because this is equivalent to the declaration of the decisive battle against the great lord. When a large lord appears in a certain abyss that already has a large lord, it often means launching a war to rob the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at the demon corps in front of him and said, "Crush over, don't fall in love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scorpion begins to land, countless night elves from the scorpion Jumping out of the middle, they quickly formed a prismatic formation and began to move forward slowly to meet the tide-like demon army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach began to take off again, and Richard flew in the air, his eyes sweeping through the entire Demon Legion, and suddenly the military strength of this legion was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a legion that the big lord used to guard the plane of the plane. The number of demons is more than a million, but the vast majority of the Legion is a little demon, the average demon is about At around 100,000, the devil is nearly a thousand, and then there are two devil lords leading the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes fell on the two small lords and asked the goshawk: “Kill it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ; Goshawk shook his head and said: "It is best not to, otherwise we will be very troublesome if we come back, maybe we must fight the big lord here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then half-death, tiramisu, water splash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill-like ogre lord like thunder He suddenly accelerated, separated from the big force, rushed to a small demon lord, and the water flower disappeared silently in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu is now up to ten meters, but it is similar to the size of the big devil, some power-type big devils up to fifteen meters, than the Tira Missu seems to be fierce, but these big demons, both strong and weak, are run by the ogres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu is like an unstoppable battle, forcing a bloody path in the devil's sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him, the demon lord of the 30-meter-high snarl, shook his bow, bent over, and rushed to Tiramisu at full speed. Many large and small demons blocking the front turned unfortunately into the stepping stone of the little lord. No matter the strength, they were directly stepped on the meat sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, the ogre and the demon lord have smashed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth in the abyss suddenly swayed, and the two power monsters were deadlocked in place, but the demons within 100 meters of them suddenly flew out and threw them hundreds of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed heavily, and the goshawks shook their heads. They all advocated the art of fighting. It’s hard for this kind of hard-hitting muscle aesthetics. Resonating, but the ogre and the devil are obviously pure fanatics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a muffled sound, the devil's little lord slowed down first, slammed into a three-pointed head, and suddenly won his one-eyed whit But the ogre had two heads. Tiramisu only took two steps back and stood firm, then flew up and stepped on the thigh joint of the demon lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon little lord screamed, and fell to the ground, the ogre leaped high, picked up the heavy hammer, and squatted at the little lord On the back of the brain, in the roar, he actually smashed it into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the demon lord swayed his big hand, grabbed the ogre, and pulled it into the deep pit together, and the bottom of the pit slammed the fist to the flesh. The sound of the screaming, the ogre and the demon lord began to beat at the bottom of the pit, playing like a wild boar with two hairs, and there was no majesty that was strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only from the spatial cracks that appear constantly above the deep pit, you know that this melee is far from being stupid as if it looks, some big devils are bold enough to want Close to the deep pit, but just entering the 100-meter range, suddenly the body burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the battlefield, the demon lord snarls uneasy and wants to go to war in the past, but he still remembers the task of commanding the legion, so Only a loud roar, but its roar suddenly became a tragedy, a faint black light wrapped around his neck for a week, then the little lord neck cracked, the blood poured down like a waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the splash appeared behind it, and the girl’s face had a touch of regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's small lord's intuition is astonishing. At the last minute, he narrowed his neck. Although he broke more than a dozen long horns, his head was at least preserved, and in the abyss. In the environment, the demon small lord's physical strength has been raised by a level, and the splash is full of hits, and it is impossible to kill it. And this kind of injury is placed on the devil, and it can only be considered a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the water flower disappeared quietly, and then the black light continued to flash on the body of the demon lord. She slammed all the essential parts such as the joints, and perhaps little damage to the small lord, but the action of the demon lord was It has been greatly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demon little lord suddenly made a terrifying roar, and the dark red fire clouds in the sky suddenly burned, and the burning meteorites fell to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the water changes, the speed flies away from the meteorite rain range, but the terrible impact of the meteorite landing is still passing her, blowing her up to fly A hundred meters, a blood squirted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slate rain soon passed, nearly a hundred giant meteorites cleaned up thousands of areas around the demon lord, and more than 100,000 heads of demons were turned into Ashes, in the vast area, only the devil lord can stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the demon little lord made an unwilling roar, and slammed his face to the sky, it summoned the meteorite rain, hurt the water, and also caused himself More damage was dealt with, and even the subordinates who had nearly half of it were sent to the funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the demon, the race that has nothing to worry about when fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the battlefield, hundreds of thousands of demons are screaming and rushing, thousands of night elf shooters in the center of the team are moving fast, while splashing a wave of arrows In the demonic camp, every wave of arrows falls, and a large blank appears in the devil's tide, but then it will be filled by more demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elves in the front row took off the thunder on their backs. When the demon approached three hundred meters, thousands of Raytheon began to roar at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the devil's Kuroshio has been thinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round of Raytheon’s shooting smashed tens of thousands of demons, while the night elves quickly changed the formation, and the inner elves rushed to the front. Then retracted into the array, and then the new Raytheon continued to roar, and the devil's Kuroshio was wiped away by a thick layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Raytheon bombarded five rounds, the demon black tide has been torn into two pieces, and tens of thousands of night elves protect the flying scorpion in the sky, from the devil camp The center passes through and goes straight to the distant plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
