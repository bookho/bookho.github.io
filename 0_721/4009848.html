			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information she received, this forward base originally belonged to the Mensa family. Has been operating for more than 10 years, more than 500 permanent soldiers, control the range of dozens of kilometers around, is completely a small town, the scale far exceeds the small outposts left by the Archimonde family to Richard. The difference can be seen from the appearance, the wall of up to ten meters is not the same as the four-meter wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a stable scale, it takes only another decade to qualify for the application of the independent plane number to the Eternal Dragon Hall. If the leader has both strategies and abduction, no matter what means to obtain a legal identity in the mainstream social system of the plane, the time required is even shorter. The numbered planes also mean stable plane channels, a greater amount of resource exchange, and a high amount of plane development profit. This is also one of the important reasons why Bear Peter is willing to pay for his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in front of Sinclair, the base like a small town is quiet, the gate is half-closed and there is no figure on the city, quiet. It’s terrible. Moreover, there are forests around the base, and there are no roads leading to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a city with more than 2,000 people and more than 500 soldiers be alone in the barren forest? In the range of tens of kilometers, even if the basic supply of farming is not considered, at least a dozen villages should be set up in terms of strategic defense layout. She does not think that the Mensa family will make this common sense mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s eyes are slightly stunned, and his heart has already had a strong unpredictable feeling. The bear of the town bears a wave and personally led ten knights and a great magician into the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the town bear knight leader and the great magician walked out of the base, and both of them were very ugly. Standing in front of Hinckler, I don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair said coldly: "Say! What can't be said? Is there a dead person inside? Then there is something big, anyway, anyway." It is the man of the Mensa family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader finally said: "Adult, there is no one in the base, no one. But everything is in Including military equipment, food, clothes, everything is there, there is no one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician next to it also opens, but the content is even more unpleasant: "But all the things can't be used. The base is full of residual time and can't be removed. It can't even live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time lighthouse!?" Sinclair screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader and the great magician looked at each other, and finally the knight leader said: "It has been extinguished..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been extinguished?!" Sinclair screamed, and the turbulent sound waves echoed even above the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The Cavaliers leader said with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair stayed and wondered what. Everyone was quiet for a while, and only the sound of the wind could be heard in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, hehehehe, hahaha!" Sinclair suddenly laughed, and the more he laughed, the more he stunned the birds. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
