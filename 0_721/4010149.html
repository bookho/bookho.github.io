			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Mensa’s eyes are full of fear and pleading, but by the blood of lightning After the heavy blow, his body was already paralyzed and he could not even speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly pulled out the long knife on his back and said to him, "You don't want to know what the knife is for?" I can tell you now, that is, I am going to use it to cut your throat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, Richard put the extinction in the small door Sa throat On, gently press down, bloody light flashes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grandstand of the grandstand, the screaming of the Duke of Mensa’s heartbreaking lungs, the sky above the head of Richard’s head suddenly went dark, and the momentum of the sky was overwhelming. A figure has been volleyed to Richard! The others have not yet arrived, and the fierce and unpredictable momentum has firmly held Richard, so that Richard can't even move his fingers! The strength of the attackers has far surpassed the ordinary sanctuary, and is close to legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was completely unable to resist and could only close his eyes with conviction. He did not expect that the Mensa family would be so arrogant, and dared to openly violate the rules of the duel and inviolability that the royal family and the royal family regarded, or in the presence of Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is dead... Mensa is doing this, and he will never live for ten years." Richard closed his eyes and waited for the fate. Sentence judgment. At the last moment, he thought to himself, finally for the man, Gordon, to recover a little interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the future fate, it will no longer belong to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! A heavy object fell heavily around Richard, and Richard’s expectation of a fatal blow did not come. Richard looked up and blinked, but saw a big man near him struggling to climb from the ground. He fell and broke his blood, making him extremely embarrassed. The big man looked blank and his blood rushed out of his mouth, and he couldn't even speak. He looked down at his waist, where a cake was inlaid! The cake is deeply embedded in the body, and the skin is not broken, but only by seeing the embedded shape, we can know that all the bones that have been affected are crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard saw the face of the big man, he knew that he was the younger brother of the Duke of Mensa, the strongman of the 19th level, Earl Kane Mensa. The attacker was just him. In the twinkling of an accident, Kane was seriously injured and landed. What hurt him was a soft cake. Kane snorted a few times, and there was another blood in his throat. He couldn’t stand anymore and slowly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha seems to have realized, looking up to the stands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the royal box, the bloodthirsty Philip is rubbing the cake crumbs of obese hands, snorted and said with disappointment: "wasted me Dessert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s Majesty stood up and said, “It’s finished, there’s nothing to look at.” Then he walked outside the box. When he left the door, he suddenly remembered something and said to the courtier: "You stayed and watched them finish all the gambling promises! I don't want anyone to challenge the rules that Charles the Great made."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter instantly put on a haze expression, Shen Sheng: "Although rest assured, kneel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the knife has been slashed into the sheath, and at a constant pace, he walked outside the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa had waited outside the duel field, rounded his eyes, pointed at Richard, and trembled: "Richard! You... hello, you are very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently wiped the blood on his hand and said faintly: "I have always been very good. It is a pity that your son doesn't seem too good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Peter Peter was equally cold, with slender eyes, said to Richard: "Dare to be the enemy of Mensa and Schumpeter, Richard, you are really amazing! But I am in the past five In the past ten years, I have seen too many great young people, and eventually they have become a bone. I only advise you to say a word, leave the vaginal words, take a closer look behind you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly burst into laughter and pointed to the Duke of Peter Peter, saying: "Is it a good idea to threaten me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear The face of the Duke of Peter became very exciting in an instant, and the aristocrats on the scene also gloated. If it weren’t for the Mensa family’s asylum, the bear Peter who had been completely disabled by Gotton had already been cleared out of the floating island. However, since there is a shelter for the Mensa family, if the Duke of Bear Peter is not allowed to leave, there is no good way to do it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly put away his smile and stared at the Duke of Peter Peter with a sharp, sharp-eyed look. "But it doesn't matter, Duke, I won't mind." This is a small offense. Because I will help you to check if Miss Qi Qi’s body is as beautiful as her face. I’m sorry to hear that you haven’t had time to marry Miss Qi Qi!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Duke of Captain Peter was immediately wonderful, and the Duke of Mensa fell into complete anger, screaming out of the sword, and yelled: "Richard! Don't be too crazy! I will kill you now!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword has been pulled out but cannot be stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of the Duke of Mensa, I don’t know when I put on a woman’s hand with a long, fair and white hair. This hand is well-proportioned and looks soft and weak. However, the Duke of Mensa, who had a seventeen-level power, could not move, and the sword was not, and the reception was not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mensa was extremely angry, looked up and glared, but saw a feminine and smiling face. Suddenly, when a basin of ice water poured down, the anger of the Duke of Mensa disappeared in an instant! All the characters who were a little knowledgeable would not recognize the close minister who Philippe the Great served with. This seems to be only a flattering guy, but he has been serving Philippe for more than 20 years. After many political storms, he can always stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier used a feminine and sharp voice to say slowly: "The meaning of your majesty is that the rules formulated by the emperor are inviolable."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menza's face instantly turned from anger to thinking, and then changed from thinking to quiet, after a sudden change, said: "Please rest assured, the Mensa family has a thousand years of history and glory, absolutely I won't regret the promised thing. 珞琪!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 stepped forward and stood next to Mensa, with no sadness and no expression on his face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa took a deep look at Richard and said: "This bet is a matter between Becky and you, my understanding is There should be no third person involved, is that the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "It should be."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good! Qi Qi, you go back with Richard, remember to listen to all of Richard's instructions. We are not a family without honor."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the Duke of Mensa turned and went, did not care about the brutality of the bear Peter, even the body of the small door Sa did not look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Menza family’s mermaid went away, leaving only Qi Qi standing alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and glanced at the gates of Mensa and Schumpeter, and then gestured to Qi Qi: "Go!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard took the people of Archimonde to the family floating island. Qi Qi quietly followed Li, and also walked to the floating island of Archimonde. Just a few steps away, Richard suddenly felt a strange look on himself, and he immediately looked back, but saw a young man with a good face looking at himself not far away. Seeing Richard's gaze, he immediately turned his eyes to the side, then turned and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the back of the young man, Richard asked Faschi: "Who is that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Fasqi is familiar with the various giants of the Fauvist, so he said: "It should be the Raymond of the Joseph family. It is famous for the wisdom of the younger generation. He is a rare Master of Solomon, and also a "Pretend to be a master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked thoughtfully and said slowly: "This guy I have heard, it seems very simple, Fortunately, he seems to be unable to live for a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi is a bit strange, she can only see that Raymond is weak, but can’t Richard made an accurate conclusion. After two magical battles, Faschi suddenly discovered that Richard had become very strange. She did not know Richard at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people couldn’t see the corner, Raymond suddenly took out a square scarf, covered his mouth and coughed fiercely. He coughed so strongly that his back was strongly twitching. It’s hard to cough, and the white square is already a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other direction, the sand is rushing to the eternal dragon temple, and it seems that he wants to smash the slate under his feet. From her teeth, I continually squeeze out a few words of self-talk: "I really shouldn't give you a fateful twin, let you be killed by a small door! You have nothing to conscience!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan, who was behind her, smiled and pretended not to hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats in the duel are reluctant to leave, still talking about the two ups and downs of the ups and downs. The bloody lightning of the stone is the center of people's topic. Presumably, for a long time, these two duels will be the best topic for the nobility after a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From being transferred back to the floating island, walking into the castle, and then sitting down in the familiar position of the study, Qi Qi always silently followed behind Li, a word Do not send. Except for her, no one came to the Mensa family. The Duke of Mensa did not even send a follower, only to let Qi Qi alone to the floating island of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where you go, Qi Qi’s beauty and temperament are enough to make her the focus of sight, and many people recognize the pearl of this Mensa family. Seeing Qi Qi, who came back with Richard, many people are talking privately, and it is difficult to conceal the shock of the bottom of my heart. In a twinkling of an eye, the gambling between Richard and Mensa was soaring, and the entire floating island knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the study, Richard asked the waiter to bring in a bottle of fine wine, and drove everyone out, leaving him and Qi Qi in the room. . Until then, Richard’s face suddenly burst into an abnormal paleness. He silently took out a bottle of vitality and drank it, and then he opened the red wine without hesitation and poured a cup for himself. Richard only let the waiter take a cup in, obviously there is no plan to give Qi Qi a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
