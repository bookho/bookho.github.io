			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already arrived outside the town, he stopped and observed This town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is small, only about a hundred buildings, the vast majority of the so-called houses are four walls, and then a cover on the whole town The most magnificent building is just a small two-story building, and it is also very simple. It seems that it is the slums of some big cities in Noland, and it is much stronger than here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of Richard’s eyes fell on the light black sè light curtain, I was a little surprised, this light curtain is actually not big, the rules contained in it The force is dense and ingenious, and a thin layer of light curtain actually has the function of shielding and correcting the twisting rules. This is not a trivial matter. It is necessary to know that the time lighthouse actually plays a similar role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and outside the light curtain, there are two worlds, many of which are blocked outside the light curtain, and the town should be a fairly normal environment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of people came out of the town, including four humans, and three aliens of different shapes. These aliens have heads similar to beasts. Walking upright, but the forelimbs are two clumps of tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyebrows and thought of a race: the Ta'a. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tana’s reputation in Noland is not obvious, but among the strong ones who explore the void, this family is quite famous because the Tana is born with Space abilities can easily hide themselves in the void, and the speed is quite fast. They are thieves and thieves in the void world. Many strong places have temporarily visited the places where they have been visited, even some legendary mage. They have also left their footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the three interracials are really the Ta'nan, then it is not a trivial matter. The Ta'a and the dragon are somewhat similar, and the individual strength is tyrannical. Fertility is low, so there are not many races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a human old man in the middle of the room shouted to Richard: "External, where are you from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The old man said that he did not know what the language was, but Richard was glad that his linguistic magic that had recently solidified was still effective. When the old man asked the second time, he could understand and answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noland." The old man was obviously taken aback, but the spear in his hand slowly put down and said: "It really makes people Surprised, there will still be people from Noland, are you a new god, ah, no, no, you have no order in the gods, but how can you come here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man talked to himself for a while, and then he waved to Richard and said, "Come in, the ghost place outside can not stay more." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chayi went to the old man, and when he passed through the light curtain, he deliberately slowed down his footsteps and carefully understood that the light curtain was magical and indeed filtered. After a lot of distorted rules, after passing through the light curtain, Richard suddenly felt a loose feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obvious signs of age and wind frost on the old man's face, but his eyes are still sharp, and the hand holding the gun is also very stable. He looks at Richard and says "There are very few people coming from Noland. It is a promising main plane. The lords inside can't look down on the dark areas, which are worthless. How come you come here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said calmly: "An accident, I was going to explore a secret, and I didn't know what happened suddenly."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An accident, okay, just be an accident." The old man shrugged and stared at Richard with a sharp gaze, then waved to him. "Whether it is an accident or something else, there is no difference now. Come with me, there are still some houses in the town, you can find a place to live in it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no hotel here." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that in this damn place, will anyone live in a hotel, but the pub is there, if you want, you can sit in the past, that is us. The only entertainment in the town, there are even spirits to sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of spirits, the old man’s throat is obviously sliding up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha with the old man coming to the other side of the town, there are several houses that are empty, just as Richard saw it outside the town. These so-called houses are simply shacks, standing inside and even standing upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very simple facility in the room. A wooden board is a bed. A few stones are tables and chairs. There is a stove in the corner of the house, but there is no pot and no bowl. There is no door or window at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several houses are almost the same. Richard casually pointed to one and lived in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he sat on the stone and began to sort out the information he got. Now Richard has understood why the old man will assign him a house directly because he has no Go where you can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dark area, traffic and information are extremely difficult, people in the town only know that there is a city far away, but the news comes from In a traveller from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a powerful warrior, but when he crossed the vast wilderness and went to the town, he was dying. After leaving the city’s position, he I soon died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the people in the town, but no one has the strength to go so far, go to the city to see, once you walk out of the light curtain, it will be At the moment, I am hurt by the twisting rules. Even if I am a strong fighter, I can’t bear much time, so no one in the town will go out of the light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the town is a life that has been growing up in the dark, where humans and aliens can always coexist, losing the power of the group, I am afraid No one can live here, and there are very few people who come from the wilderness outside the light curtain like Richard. It is said that the earliest one has lived here for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sitting in the hut, motionless, and continues to analyze the rules. This is a strange world. Richard has not found any way to add magic. He also I don't feel hungry, but my physical strength is really consumed bit by bit, so he has to save every bit of magic and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man threw Lee in this hut, he never appeared again, looked out from the door, there was no one on the street, also watched Less than birds and beasts, no life, the sky is always gray and black, never changed, there is no night, no weather changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a day or so, Richard finally resolved a new rule, which made Richard feel more clear about the dark areas and his movements became stable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic rules that make up the world in the dark areas are the same, but all the rules are distorted here. The way of twisting is also a kind of rule. Through these days of observation, Richard has successfully established the model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make your perceptions match the dark areas, you need to analyze the 16 big rules, but to use the rules of the dark areas, you need to analyze An extra sixteen rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Richard has unrecognized six rules, so there is no big problem in basic action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard decided to go to the town to see, especially the pub, as if it was the only special place here, not to be missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is still empty, but after a crossing, Richard suddenly heard a slap in the face, and he immediately looked at the sound. Seeing that at the edge of the light curtain, an alien like a lizard is fighting a Ta'na, and there are several residents in the town watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tana people are seen by Richard, while lizards are raw faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not move and walked over and asked a human race: "What is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The person shrugged and said: "An outsider who has just arrived in the dark area has not recognized his situation. When he thinks of coming to the wilderness, he thinks that he is invincible in his own plane." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the lizard and the Tana is not intense, and even funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack of the lizard man is all about the East, there is no quasi-head, and the footsteps are also awkward, like a drunkard who drinks too much, which There is a demeanor of a real strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tana is obviously teasing it, sometimes even arrogantly swaying in front of the mouth of the lizard with his own tail, angry with lizards The violent jump was like a thunder, and even grabbed a bite, desperately trying to break the tail, but it opened its mouth, but it was hard to bite into the empty space. The harder it was, the bigger it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw that the lizard was still in a state of perceptual disorder, and that this type of race often had a strong fighting power, but it was necessary to analyze the rules. There is a lot of difference, and it falls to the dark area. It is really unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
