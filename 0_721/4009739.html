The difference between this snow rabbit and the ordinary snow rabbit is that the coat color of the trunk is light brown. This is because the magic pattern is inserted, and the fur of those parts is a little broken and peeled off, and a clear magical pattern can be seen from the place where the hair is lost. On the one hand, these features show that Richard's construction plug-in is not perfect enough to make the magic pattern and the carrier fully integrated. On the other hand, it shows that the snow rabbit itself is not strong enough, and can only bear the load. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as this snow rabbit appeared, the area of ​​the Soram family immediately sounded a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such a weak thing defeat the winter wolf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea still hold their chins with both hands, and look at everything in the experimental field with their heart, but they can’t see any worry from her little face or Tense like this expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Snow Rabbit entered the stadium, Master Phil suddenly sat up straight, and his face suddenly appeared with a look of uncertainty. After the mountain and the sea, the great sacrifice Ulazazu opened his turbid eyes, carefully looked at the snow rabbit for a while, floated a smile on his mouth, and slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking Su Hailun has a small head and a small hand, holding his face and starting to fight. It can be seen that the money-making journey between the planes is very hard, and the legendary Master has not fully recovered his strength until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the experimental field, and the attention of the winter wolf was immediately attracted to the snow rabbit. And this little snow rabbit is not too weak, bursting up the neck hair, screaming at the winter wolf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the provocation of such a weak race, the winter wolf did not hesitate to enter the attack state, it made a low roar in the throat, the body slowly lowered, and suddenly jumped lightning Out, bite on the back of the snow rabbit! Out of the audience's surprise, the Snow Rabbit, which showed no fear, turned out to be unrestrained and was slammed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow rabbit is suffering and struggling, but it has been smashed in the air by the winter wolf, and how to struggle is just a short walk. However, at this moment, the snow rabbit suddenly took a breath, his eyes turned from a crystal-like micro blue to a deep red blood, the body quickly expanded, and the thick fur could not cover the rolling flame inside the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! A fireball suddenly ignited in the center of the experimental field, and it rose into a small mushroom cloud. It continued to rise straight, and the magical array that hit the top of the experimental field dissipated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow rabbit has completely disappeared, the winter wolf's wedge-shaped muzzle is gone, and the entire front body is black. It struggled to take two steps. Suddenly, one fell and the limbs twitched a few times, and they never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence on the side of the experimental field. The change was really too sudden. From the snow rabbit to the explosion, it took a few moments before and after. Except for the three or five people, no one will think that there has been such a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the side of the experimental field and looked up to Su Hailun, but there was an undisguised pride on his calm face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s closed eyes suddenly opened a line, screaming at him, his eyes brows, all smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the silence was broken by a hysterical bark: "Cheat! This is cheating!!" The Dragon Warlock, who was desperately trying to turn over the railing and rushing to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place without any movement, but his eyes narrowed slightly, and the fingers of his left hand began to tremble subconsciously. If the Dragon Warlock really rushes over, Richard will let him understand the skills of the dark world. The look of the steel rock immediately fell on the left hand of Richard, and then looked at the dragon sorcerer who struggled and screamed, and his face flashed with a touch of disdain, a slamming sound, the movement was obvious, and the direction was clearly directed at the side and spit out a sip. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Soram family only saw the movement of the steel rock, several warriors were busy holding Stefanson, and several other magicians I whispered together and whispered something. And Minnie was sitting in the crowd of the Soram family, looking at Richard, the complexness that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​the Soram family is already in chaos, and the dark blue magisters are sitting still, except to exchange views with each other. There is no big movement. The mountains and the sea are now only looking at Richard, and the rest are not. Just when she stared at Richard's face, her look began to become a bit coveted, but she tried to sit still and keep the so-called lady gesture on the continent of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian warriors behind her mostly looked confused and didn’t understand what was happening in the experimental field, but several court guards were well-informed and their faces were slight. Change, obviously thought of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the experimental field, the half-focused winter wolf lay quietly, and there was no possibility of standing up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't accept!! He cheated!" The Dragon Warlock has been insane, struggling with all his strength, and even four warriors can hardly hold him down. . He even bite in the arm of a family warrior in front of him, so that the warrior sucked the cold, but never dared to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soram family stood up in the back of a attire of an ordinary old man, sighed, waved a moment of sleep, lost in Stevenson Body. The Dragon Warlock was originally very resistant to the magic of sleep, but the magic of the old man seemed to make him not have the slightest resistance. He struggled a few times and fell asleep. It is only from a lot of super magic effects attached to a sleep technique that you can see that this is an old big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at Stevenson and said: "Bring him back." Soram warrior immediately carried Stevenson and left the experiment. field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Stevenson was lifted away, the old man walked out of the Soram family area and walked away to Su Hailun with a very apology: Sorry, this is because our Soram family discipline is not strict, and I hope that my Highness will not be placed on my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun patted the small mouth and hit a Yawning, barely opened his eyes. As for the super-magic techniques used by the old man to understate the magical effects, magic penetration, etc., they are not in her eyes. If this sleep technique is thrown out of her hand, it can instantly bring down everyone in the Soram family. Even the steel rock, a natural anti-magic holy warrior, is no more than half the chance to resist. The status of the old man and his respectful attitude are the reasons why she is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count, Fron. Soram, how come you sneaked to me, didn't say hello. Is it afraid that the exam will not? Fair?” Su Hailun asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Furon. Soram is the younger brother of the Duke of Soram, belonging to the aristocrats of the field, and is also a great magister of the 18th level, in the Soram family. Inside is a very powerful branch. The reason he is now in dark blue is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count Fron sighed and looked at Richard in a complicated look. He said, "No, the game is indeed that we lost. The result is fair. The snow rabbit has just added the magic pattern that simulates the self-explosive ability. It is possible to simulate the effect of the three-level structure with the initial structure, even if it is only one-third of the power, which is close to the master's technique. You should specify the test site for this game. With the understanding of the installation, Richard can create a magical structure, and we only use the standard construction. No matter whether the design of this magical design is really from the hands of Richard, in this sense, we have already lost "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think like this! Don't be so depressed, but you just lost an opportunity, chances, this thing, here in my total Yes, the legendary Master said with a smile. "Considering the long-term good relationship between Dylan and the Duke of Soram, I can consider giving you a self-funded place. The tuition fee is the same as before, as long as the standard is self-funded. Half is ok. Of course, this learning direction will not be in the field of the builders. Well, this way, I have no students in the field of blood talents, do you want to consider? A powerful blood warlock is a mobile on the battlefield. "Magic cannon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fron's face twitched a few times, once again sincerely thanked the legendary mage for his kindness, saying that he must go back to the Duke to think about it. Then choose a truly talented child to study in dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fron did have the grace of the old aristocrats, and once again gladly expressed his congratulations to Richard before leaving with the Soram family. After the people of Soram left, the gray dwarf suddenly sighed and filled with regret. In fact, when Stevenson was taken away, the legendary mage also looked at him with reluctance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every student can change the trick to send money to the legendary mage. In this field, the Dragon Warlock did not encounter opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, although the legendary mage specially created a field of bloody warlocks for him, the Soram family seems to have made up their minds to stop the loss from expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Dark Blue Master entered the experimental field and began to clean up. They looked at the blackened winter wolf body and whispered low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master finally couldn’t help but stand up and ask Li: "Licha, the magic pattern you attached to the snow rabbit is a simulation. The self-explosive ability is still inward burst?" When talking about the inward burst, Phil's tone can not help but tremble. The inward burst is a nine-level magic, and it can reproduce its magical pattern, which is only the fifth-order demon suit of the Solomon family. When the words were exported, Phil realized that he was too excited. Inward burst, even if it only simulates part of the power, it must be a three-level structure, and Richard's use on the snow rabbit is only the initial structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down the excitement and gave a slight salute to the direction of the big magisters, such as answering the teacher’s question in class: "My demon The texture is referenced to the self-explosive structure, but it can only achieve the self-explosion effect, and the structure of the standard self-explosive structure is completely different. There are too many structures in the third-order structure that I can't currently produce, so I actually Using a tricky way, a magical array of three fireballs was set up in the structure, which was inspired by the vitality of the snow rabbits. Two of the fireballs were attached with a magical delay magical array to achieve the three fireballs exploding at the same time. The purpose of this, in order to achieve the effect of superposition of power. When the snow rabbit struggles on the edge of life and death, the life energy of the burst will trigger the effect of the magic pattern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the three standard fireballs explode at the same time, the superimposed power generated exceeds 70 energy levels, which is enough to cause fatal damage to the winter wolf, let alone the vulnerable part of the mouth to explode? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
