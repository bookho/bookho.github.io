The title is now designated by His Highness Su Hailun, and this half-year period is the time for both parties to learn to improve and prepare for the test. Richard and Stevenson who can truly inherit Su Hailun's knowledge of the magic pattern, is determined by the results of this game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the big mentors suddenly became fascinated, and the so-called opportunity was given. It’s just that the gray dwarf wants to earn more than half a year from Stevenson! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the financial situation of His Highness have deteriorated to such a degree? However, they immediately reacted, the legendary mage's finances will only be too healthy, and the problem is only the deep blue finances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of any creature that targets more gold coins, time is very precious, especially on the mainland of Noland. So after making the decision, the legendary mage did not delay any time, and decided the topic of the game half a year directly at the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions and questions will be sent to Richard and Stevenson later in the day, and of course Minnie will receive one. But no one will have any hope for her. The news of the defeat of Marquis of Nio has already spread to the top of the deep blue. With the big magister as the center, and their close to the disciples as the periphery of the deep blue core circle, the look of Richard is very different. In the past, Richard was only considered to be a little guy with amazing talent, and fortunately got the favor of His Royal Highness. Now, with the rise of the Akmon family as a volcanic eruption, no one dares to look down on Richard from the background of the family power, at most, behind the son of the nouveau riche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nightfall, there was a burst of cheers in Stevenson’s residential area, and Stevenson held a paperwork that he could hardly believe. eye! He repeatedly watched it more than a dozen times, only to believe that this is really not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, the Dragon Warlock felt that Su Hailun preferred him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conspiracy of blood-staining was not punished, not even mentioning that the things he had been most worried about had passed. Since the Deep Blue executives have already made a conclusion on this matter, no matter whether the Archimonde family or Richard himself hides more powerful forces, he does not have to worry about direct retaliation in the future. What made him most ecstatic was that the door of the builder who had thought that he had completely closed in front of him had now reopened and gave him a chance to compete with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair? Stevenson doesn't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a Dragon Warlock, already seventeen years old, and the magic is more than ten, and behind him has the support of the whole family financial resources, the most important thing is that behind him There is also a real builder! The time of the game was set after half a year, but the title was issued now. This is simply encouraging him to cheat! Although the structure required to solve the problem requires Stevenson to make his own placement, the material can be handled and provided by the family, and the design can be completely perfected by Santa Cruz! For half a year, enough for Stevenson to fill all the short boards for a specific solution and create the corresponding magic pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His living area has two more iron cages, one of which is a strong winter wolf in the big iron cage with the imprisonment magic. This two-meter-long giant wolf is one of the unique fierce warcraft in the north. In addition to its powerful strength, it can also rely on talent to cast two spells of cold and slow and ice arrows, and the winter wolf can live long enough. Breathing out in the cold. In the other cage, there are a few fat polar snow rabbits. This snow-white fur rabbit has excellent resistance to cold and breeds extremely fast. However, in addition to flexible movements and fast speed, there is no attack ability. It is the first World of Warcraft that can be seen everywhere in the North China. It is also the cornerstone of the entire Warcraft food chain. The winter wolf is based on snow rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s topic is to use the magic pattern he made to arm the snow rabbit and then defeat the winter wolf. Very simple, but also a very difficult topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the winter wolf is naturally over, and it is not much slower than the snow rabbit, plus the magic of attacking more than 30 meters, Snow Rabbit There is no power to fight back before the winter wolf, and the natural weakness makes it difficult to become a good magic structure. Any kind of first-order magical structure is not enough for the snow rabbit to compete with the winter wolf, and it is not a problem that the primary constructor can accomplish by loading the second magical structure on its small body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are solutions to the difficult problems. If Santa Cruz can't solve it, Stevenson believes that Richard can't finish. Moreover, the rules are also very clear. If the snow rabbits on both sides fail to defeat the winter wolf, they will evaluate the results and decide the winner according to the level of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ecstasy, Stephenson, who calmed down, began to seriously think about the title of the legendary mage. On the match day, the winter wolf provided by Deep Blue is definitely similar in strength, but the Snow Rabbit is prepared by Richard and Stevenson himself. Like all Warcraft, Snow Rabbit also has the strength and the size of the size, because the need to load the magic pattern, the selected strong snow rabbit and the ordinary snow rabbit's final combat power is also very different. Half a year, enough to train two generations of new snow rabbits. To know that the Soram family can be known for training Warcraft, after half a year, Stevenson will definitely give Richard a big surprise with a brand new snow rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivating a new breed of Warcraft requires a huge investment, at this moment can be ignored, if Stevenson can win this, then the previous Everything is worth it. The winter wolf and snow rabbit in the iron cage are all free trials provided by Deep Blue, but only once, you need to buy it at a high price in the future, or simply capture it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people suddenly see hope in a desperate situation, the energy of bursting is often huge. Stevenson has acknowledged his failure in talent, but he is determined to put the power of the family in front of new opportunities and use gold coins to pave the way to the builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter explaining the latest developments in the incident, and a letter expressing Stevenson’s determination to re-enter the magical array. Not long after, the magic array of communication was lit, and a page of magic letters was sent back. The letter was written by the Duke of Soram, only a few lines, but the meaning is very clear. The Soram family will support Stevenson and win the game. At the end of the letter, the Duke only asked for one, and no more stupid things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson understands what this sentence means. Gordon’s deeds on the day of fate have spread throughout the mainland, and now the Akmon family is not inferior to the Soram family. If Stevenson does something similar to the assassination attempt, then no one can save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time Devenson was determined to beat Richard in the right direction of the rules. Su Hailun is still a favorite of him, but her taste... it is a little strange. The Dragon Warlock thinks that since the legendary Master can even enter the entrance to Richard, there will not be a turn in the future. Wait until that day... There is really one day, but Stevenson is not absolutely confident. There is a key point that is difficult to circumvent, and a warlock with a strong dragon's blood is likely to be unable to reinvigorate a man's glory in front of the legendary mage, unless the legendary wizard is willing to converge her reverse dragon. But can that thing converge? At least Longwei can't converge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the residential area with several floors down, Richard is kneeling in front of the iron cage and watching the winter wolf and the snow rabbit. The legendary Master’s decision also made him very surprised. At the beginning, he even had some grievances and resentments. However, with the continuous research on the subject, Richard has left all his emotions behind, and concentrated on immersing himself in the world of magic lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
