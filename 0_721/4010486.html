			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancestral highlands, tens of thousands of troops are using the original shrine of the high gods The central point, attacked in all directions, sweeping all the barbarian tribes encountered along the way, the five thousand regular army stationed in the city, officially incorporated this land into the territory of the deep red Principality, and another 50,000 main force, but was Richard Quietly transferred back to the blood-stained land, stationed in a secret valley, only a few dozen kilometers away from the border of the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tension in the highland temple still exists, but a large number of artisans are pouring into the city, they will build three temples around the eternal dragon temple, respectively The goddess used, the pastors of the three goddesses have been stationed in large numbers, they will be responsible for the transformation of these shallow believers, several large-scale cargo teams have already set off, and when they arrive, the food, clothes and wines filled with them will make the shallow believers see Really promising beliefs, even if they refuse to change their beliefs, they will be shaken in their hearts. For Richard, this is enough. The shallow believers are the greatest source of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods carried by several cargo fleets are worth millions, enough for tens of thousands of people in the city to live in a rich and warm winter, what is the purpose of doing this, Li Some of them are unclear, not all ideals, not just to cut off their beliefs, perhaps both. As Io said, people are contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard is not in his own army. He rides a brain and is flying to a small oasis city in the city. Only a few thousand people, away from the main trade routes, so life is peaceful and quiet, there is a small and clear lake in the center of the oasis, maintaining the survival of people in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard entered the city, it was dusk, the city was full of smoke, and there was always a scent of barbecue. The people walking on the street were mostly relaxed. The city is also very clean, and slaves responsible for cleaning can be seen from time to time. In this city, slaves still have obvious signs, but most of them look healthy and strong, and are not as weak and weak as slaves of other human countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of this small town made Richard quite satisfied. The plane war accumulated a huge amount of wealth for Richard. His eyes were mostly on how to quickly arm the army. On the other hand, when Ellie became a companion, the female goddess showed her other talents in the governance of the territory. Faro’s policy of territory in other planes was mostly from her hands, in her own territory. Ellie can squeeze out a small amount of military expenses for the development of the people's livelihood, especially for the policy of Richard. Although Richard has not let her intervene in the Faro plane, the followers of Faro have already begun. Spontaneously borrowed from her policy practices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, cleaning up the city halls will have a group of slaves of their own, responsible for the cleanliness of the entire city, maintenance of public facilities, etc., and in the deep red duchy, these slaves receive twice as much food ration as other human countries, eating If you don't finish it, you can keep it for your family. Only on this point, many slaves will work hard to avoid being sold by the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this leisurely small town passing through several blocks, Richard stopped in front of a very quiet ordinary courtyard and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the courtyard door slammed open, revealing a wrinkled face, this is an old man, and he will come to the end of his life, he The eyes have become turbid, and the accidental color is revealed after a while, saying: "It is Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me, Palin, I haven't seen it for a long time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at Richard for a while and then sighed: "You are exactly the same as the year, now I believe that you are indeed different." Come in, I didn’t expect to see you again before I die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee followed Peel into the courtyard and saw the courtyard With a flower shovel and a jug, it seems that Palin is now in the yard to take care of the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the well-trimmed garden and smiled and said: "It seems that you are doing well now, I thought you are still perfecting your plane." "The mathematics system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling sighed and said, "This is not because of you, if it is not you, I will not know how to spend a lifetime studying it. The things have long been studied in other planes, and they have already become perfect systems. Since this is the case, then what is the significance of my research? In the recent period, I can feel that I am rapidly aging. So I want to do something I have never done before in the last part of my life, such as drinking tea, eating something different, trying to take care of the garden myself, even I learned to be in a daze and a nap." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said, "It seems that you are much better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, the maid sent black tea and delicate tea, and then returned to the room, leaving Richard and Palin alone in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling picked up the teacup, but did not rush to drink, but looked at Richard, slightly hopeful and uneasy to ask: "You are coming this time, not Just to come and have a cup of tea with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, I came here specifically. There are two things. One is to complete a promise to the Duke of the Wolf. The other is to see if you are willing to help me. This thing can be given to you. An extra three years of life." Said, Richard took out a time hourglass and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very delicate little thing, you can see the extraordinary at a glance, Palin is looking at the inside of a grain slowly falling Sand, I can't breathe for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is better than walking to the end of life, but suddenly knows that there will be extra life more exciting things, Palin reaches out and thinks I have to touch it, but his fingertips are shaking, and he has to face the hourglass, but he can’t push it anyway. He is afraid that this is a beautiful bubble. Once it is touched, It is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you can't make it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentence from Richard, Immediately let Palin bounce off the chair, he stared at Richard, the throat was rolled up and down a few times, but nothing was said, Palin tried to suppress the breath, let himself calm down, then slowly Sit down and ask: "You need me to do something. I don't think I have anything to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Richard is as charming as ever. Say: "This thing is called the hourglass, it is... Oh, a very special thing, from the eternal and time dragon's grace, want to use it, you need an extra condition, that is to give up on you The ancestor worship is changed to the eternal and time dragon, because you are not a Nolan, this is the only way to make the hourglass effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Change the letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this time hourglass is my commitment to your father, I finally have a chance to finish it, so you don't need to do anything for me, just be responsible for your own choices." Richard said, and put a badge on the table, the badge is a wolf head, it is The symbol of the inheritance of the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a badge on one side and a hourglass on the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling’s forehead began to ooze sweat. This time the choice was not as simple as changing the letter. He spent his life studying the mathematics of the plane. He vaguely felt that the choice was actually behind It was a choice between Faro and Noland. I chose the time hourglass and got extra life. At the same time, I stood on the opposite side of the whole Faro. From then on, there will be no turning back. The rule is the most ruthless because it Directly pointing to the soul, and not to deceive, this time, it is fundamentally different from the grace of God after the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Palin didn't know what to say, raised her hand and put it down again, and finally buryed her face in her hand and didn't lift it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for a while before saying, "If I were you, I would definitely choose the hourglass."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You love this plane, but it doesn't love you, the plane is just structured in a series of rules In the world, any living creature living in it is dispensable for it. Even a too powerful creature is a tumor-like existence for the plane itself. In addition, if you are If you want to do something for Faro, then you obviously have to be alive," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Noland will conquer Faro." Palin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will, not me, other people, I can not boast that you will not want other people from Nolan to come to Faro." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling nodded: "This is true, the civilians of the Principality of the Red Cross are better than most of the Faro countries, but they don't know the future." What would it look like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Palin picked up the hourglass, Richard smiled and handed over a paper that had already been prepared, saying: "Pray before you use it. As for the life of the civilians in the Principality, that is the future. You can try to influence my decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin Meditate on the prayers, and then break the time hourglass. When I look at the pieces of sand, the sand turns into a light band and sinks into my body. I breathe a sigh of relief and says, "What do you want me to do for you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took out a book and placed it on the table, saying: "This is a complete plane math, you have ten days to learn it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;啪, another book is placed in front of Palin. "This is the basic principle of magical mathematics in magical mathematics. This book can relax some time, you have twenty days."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third book appeared again. "This is the general theory of functional magic. There are dozens of the most basic functional magic arrays. You have ten days." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
