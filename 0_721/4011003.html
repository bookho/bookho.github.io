			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund’s army is well-trained, and immediately gives up a favorable position after receiving the order, even if it is battling with flesh-and-blood warriors, Retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hole in the air has gradually formed, it is full of jar size! Such a huge black hole has a range of effects that has already exceeded a kilometer. The items captured by it, from the spider warriors, the fighters, to the earthy rocks on the ground, slowly swirl around it and are gradually pulled in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A medium-sized fighter aircraft was obviously distorted and elongated as it approached the black hole, and then disappeared a little from the people's field of vision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the black hole is still expanding, it seems to be slow and fast, and it has covered nearly 10,000 meters in a blink of an eye! On the earth, there was a horrible crack, and large chunks of land were torn out and flew to the black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hair still standing in front of the front line began to fly, no face screamed at the back: "Enough! Quickly neutralize it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard once again summoned three faces, three different rules of the gods fireball shot, flying into the black hole in the air. After the fireball broke into the black hole, the black hole shook a few times and then returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face changed slightly, knowing that this black hole has been raised for a long time, and then let it develop freely, it is likely to open directly on the Faro wall. A big hole! This does not require any reapers, and Richard himself has destroyed Faro a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face sinks, three faces quickly whispering the gods, and the gods of fire with regular forces fired into the black holes in the air, one after another. After the seven or eight fireballs were fired, the black hole finally showed signs of disintegration, and the objects floating in the air began to fall slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper fighters that were towed resumed their power and immediately dispersed in all directions. The strong men on the Richard side saw this scene, but they were relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard does not have the ability to neutralize this black hole, then no one can escape the black hole except for a few strong ones that can be transmitted to the void outside the plane. Capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the black hole grows, its capture range expands at geometric speeds and may eventually cover thousands of kilometers or more. Of course, in this disaster, the Faro gods are the greatest help. The gods can work together to neutralize the black hole, but before the neutralization, in the core of the black hole generation, no one on this battlefield can escape, and it has long become a black hole food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hole finally disappeared, but there were still large dark ripples floating in the air. That is the damaged space, which cannot be repaired automatically. From these spatial corrugations, there is also the potential energy of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few huge wills carefully swept through the area and circumvented Richard far away. Above the sky, the gods who are tall are looking down at the world with complex expressions. Whether it is the powerful Xerxes, the new goddess of spring water, or the southern god who was almost beaten down, it is silent at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the gods did not think that Richard’s power had reached the level of horror, and he could create a real black hole inside the plane! This ability is the power that should not be used inside the plane at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the black hole generation to the neutralization, just a few minutes before and after, it has already smoothed everything within a few kilometers of the surrounding area, and even eroded one on the ground. A huge pit that is hundreds of meters deep. If the troops of the Crimson Kingdom are withdrawing fast enough, they will be circled by black holes. Even so, the last few hundred kingdom warriors disappeared with the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro’s plane origin was also hit hard, and the gods could almost hear the rules that built the entire Faro crying. Even if the black hole has been neutralized, the injured plane is still flowing outwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the gods have a real fear of the deepest part of the soul. Richard with this ability will be the nemesis of all secondary planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's army was erased most of the time. There are only a few hundred fighters and nearly 10,000 flesh-and-blood warriors, and the high-end units have been lost. The next battle was the end, and Richard only sent high-level troops above the night elves to completely wipe out the remaining reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle finally came to an end, the reaper army was completely annihilated, and under the attack of Richard and the faceless, there was not even a transport ship. Can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last ship crashed, Richard, standing in the sky, overlooked the earth and was impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the battlefield, there was a terrible trauma on the earth. Around the wound, the wreckage of the body and the reaper is everywhere. The flames are burning, and the black smoke obscures half the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops of the distant Richards are gathering, but this team of less than 10,000 people is down by four-fifths in scale. According to the standard of the general battlefield, this level of casualties can already be erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the surviving are the night elves, the frost warriors, the arrow beasts and other soulless nests, and the real warriors of the deep red kingdom with blood, flesh and soul, Then he died in the war. In the first battle, a full 60,000 troops were still less than 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew how bad his losses were. There are only half of the three hundred knights, and seven of the more than thirty of the Sanctuary are killed and six have lost their fighting power forever. Four thousand night elves killed eight hundred in the final short-lived melee of the war. Because the target of the Frost Warrior was too large, almost all of the divine warriors died, and only one quarter of the non-divine warriors remained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps since the command of Archimonde, Richard has not suffered such a terrible loss. Therefore, although this Richard has won, he can't laugh anyway. No one can still laugh at those who are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I don’t know where to appear next to Richard, I watched him with the devastated land and said slowly: "Don’t think too much." This is the war. If you want to defeat the reaper, this is the price you must pay. We are desperate to be able to live. If you don’t fight, all people will die.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed. If it weren't for him that he eventually used the black hole ability that should not be used in the plane, it would not be so easy to beat the reaper. However, the number of reapers is too much. This time it is only a tragic victory, but it is not known how many troops the reaper has hidden behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the rest of the army after the robbery, and then looked at the facelessly and said: "It seems that only two of us have gone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrimp shruglessly, saying: "When you are the guardian of the heavens, it is really a hard work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard smiled a little weakly, called a messenger, sat up with no face, and rushed to another battlefield to support. On the messenger, Richard kept drinking pharmacy, but despite this, when the messenger flew to the battlefield, Richard only recovered two-thirds of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military configuration of this battlefield is also very impressive, headed by Tiramisu, guarded by three other legendary powerhouses. The reapers attacking here are much less than those on Richard, so the ogre can still support it. For the reaper, Tiramisu seems to be more adapted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard arrived, the ogre was striding forward and rushing to a war elephant. The hill-like body makes the Ogre lord's momentum as much as the mechanical warfare. The two sides rushed together and the earth shook! The result of the collision was shocking, and the mechanical warfare with a much larger body was actually knocked out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre lord picked up the warhammer and smashed the chassis of the battle elephant completely, and then leaped from his shoulder a small The figure, wielding a huge warhammer that is completely disproportionate to the body, completely smashes the upper body of the war elephant with just one hammer! An astonishing war elephant was actually picked up by two hammers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this hammer is comparable to the full power of the legendary strongman, but the figure of the hammer is very familiar to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the mountain and the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the mountains and the sea were sleeping most of the time, they were also confused when fighting, and they were fighting instinct. In addition to showing some inhuman power, she is not too prominent. But now the mountain and the sea in front of Richard are completely different. This hammer shows the strength of the legendary level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she finally woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little unacceptable for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun and the mountain, like the sea, have had a long sleep. Su Hailun sleeps from level 24 to level 29. The mountain and the sea span a greater span, and simply fell from level 11 to level 21! This way of upgrading the ranks makes Richard, who has been exhausted and tired and has not slackened at all times, extremely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps Richard is not the most depressed, after all, he has now reached a super-strong level of combat. Those legendary powerhouses who have gone through thousands of hardships but have ended the 21st level, even those heavenly sanctuaries who can't even enter the legend, know that it is even more necessary to spurt a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Richard has a strange feeling. If she let the mountain and the sea sleep for a few more years, will she sleep directly as a super strong? This seems very likely, the blood of the ancient beast gods, no matter how to describe it can not be overemphasized. Otherwise, the dragon of eternal and time does not have to be so arrogant for a string of animal bracelets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
