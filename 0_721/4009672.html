The deeper meaning is understood only after a few years, and the experience is extremely profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meeting, Richard sat in the high back chair, his body stiffened like a statue, his eyes slightly to the sky, and the focus of his sight fell on the mural above the door. On, do not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the small living room in the inner castle, located in the other wing of the evening restaurant, only for the family. The decoration here is rich and luxurious, and is completely different from the darkness of the entire castle. The living room is warm and bright, and the fixed lighting magic provides a white-like brightness. A large number of candles are carried in a gorgeous large hanging candlestick, which adds just the right warmth in addition to the visual effects. On the couch around Richard, he sat with his brothers and sisters. Specifically, it is two younger brothers and six sisters. Richard never thought that he would have such a large number of brothers and sisters. This is only a half-brother. If you are a cousin with Akmon's blood, you must be even bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brothers are sitting on the left side of Richard, the sisters are sitting on the right, and Richard is in the middle, suffering from the burning gaze of the eyes, waiting for an anatomy Rare World of Warcraft. Unlike the statue-like Richard, the brothers and sisters are much more arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boys are younger than Richard, but the look they have has ** naked curiosity, contempt and hostility, everything, only There is no family. Their gaze made the fluff behind Richard's neck stand up, only when Richard felt the killing. The six sisters are of different sizes, and the biggest one has already declared his teenage identity with a bulging chest, and the small may not be five years old. The eyes they looked at were much more complicated, curious, and more of them were scrutiny and hesitation. The two biggest girls are together, whispering something, always looking at Richard, and occasionally bursting with some arrogant and full of sly smiles. There are more red-faced things in their eyes. Richard still doesn't understand what it is, but he has nothing to do with his brothers and sisters. But Richard soon knew that kind of gaze was the look of a woman looking at the man who wanted to go to bed with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, he did not know what to say. The brothers and sisters did not mean to talk to him. They just kept staring at him with hot eyes. Some of them were sharp and cold and couldn’t wait to poke a hole in him. Some of them couldn’t wait to swallow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to meet is not long, only ten minutes. Richard felt that it was a long day, and it was still a very long day. When the butler took him out of the living room, he found that the linen shirt inside was already soaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Richard knew that the ten minutes of meeting with his brothers and sisters was actually a ritual, representing that he was recognized to own this Archimonde. The blood has become a member of the Archimonde family. This ritual also provides members of Archimonde with an opportunity to recognize each other and to choose each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon, Richard left the Black Rose Castle in a cluster of cavalry and marched toward the West. After dinner that day, until leaving Ashan, Richard never saw Gotton again. Meeting with my father seems to be simpler and more indifferent than I thought. Richard had no expectation of meeting, but when he left Ashan, he did not know why there was a faint loss. Many brothers and sisters let him understand that he is just an ordinary child of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard quietly clenched his fists, and his nails even pierced the palm of his hand. The two pictures overlap in front of his eyes, one is a large number of brothers and sisters, and the other is a burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that his mother died so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team went all the way to the west, and escorted Richard is still Modred. On this trip, the Cavaliers have a lot less words, and often they can't say a few gossips all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent journey lasted for twenty days, longer than it was. On the way through the dark forest, crossed the mainland's second long Roman River, walked along the pale mountain for another ten days, then crossed the territory of more than a dozen nobles, and passed a Grand Duchy before arriving at the destination of this trip, legend The territory of the great magician Su Hailun, the magic tower is dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space is powerful, and huge space always puts substantial pressure on people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When truly standing in front of the deep blue, Richard knows how magnificent a magic tower of more than 500 meters high. This is not a single building. The entire dark blue-tone building community is backed by a branch of the Hengdong Mountains that extends to the ice floes. The main building is a typical Gothic style, and the flying buttresses are beautifully decorated. The carvings, the eye-catching spires and the pointed arches stand tall and straight, the colorful elements and arcane energy linger on the apex, and the whole magic tower seems to be sublimating into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Richard saw Su Helun, a woman who is a legendary mage, a sacred ally guardian, and a dragon slayer. It is also a Gotton. The mentor chosen for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only when Richard really stood in front of Su Hailun that he realized that the family had never promised to teach him that this trip was entirely Gotton’s. Wishful thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the magic hall of Su Helun at the moment, this is a dreamy space. The four walls and the ground do not know what kind of material is made. The dark blue is the base color, and the crystal is moist and lustrous. If it looks like jade, it seems to be deep in the eye, and it looks like nothing. From time to time, there are various bands of light on the ground and the walls. They are irregular, like a group of playful fish, and they are as vivid as life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the high platform at one end of the hall, with a throne carved from a piece of natural crystal, Su Helun sits on the throne, and the horizontal position of the foot Close to Modred's chin, beyond Richard's head, this is a real high. But in her legendary identity, there is no one who feels rude. Su Hailun's long blond hair is casually held, and the palace-style low-cut dress reveals the entire shoulder and a large white chest. Her skin is so white and unbelievable that any part of it looks like an impulse to bite. Of course, the place where you most want to have a mouth is the first full breast, followed by the face. Her appearance seems to be at most 17 or 18 years old, her face is solemn and solemn, full of classical beauty, sitting on the crystal throne standing on the edge, like the goddess of the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time someone who saw her was completely unable to connect such a young and beautiful woman with the legendary mage. But even the youngest magician knows that the dark blue has been built for more than a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she staggered her hands in front of her knees, each finger is covered with long finger cots, they are made of magical gold, topped with Various colored stones and patterns. In fact, those patterns are a magical array of micro-inscriptions, all of which are set in the array, all of which are rare magical gems that exist only in the legend. In the eyes of those who know how to do it, each of these finger cots is a powerful magical guide, perhaps close to artifacts. However, Su Hailun actually filled all ten fingers! And her earrings, necklaces and even the hairline of the hair are also the magical equipment similar to the fingertips! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal throne is extremely dazzling, even if the child who does not understand this 李 都能 can see its precious, but the value of this magic hall is hundreds of times the crystal throne. The abyss crystal used by the magician to inlay the staff is used here to build the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic hall, Richard suddenly felt that his ability to perceive greatly expanded, and that the silk energy began to follow some strange passages into his body. . When the same force of filament enters the body, it is gradually absorbed by Richard. At this moment, there is a sudden broken glass in the consciousness of Richard. It seems that there is a barrier that is broken at this moment, which makes him tied. The perception is completely divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Richard touched a magical ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark sea, no light, the undercurrent of the sea, can swallow a giant whale at any time, and if Richard falls into In this sea, it will be swallowed up in an instant, and even a little will not appear. But at this moment, Richard is standing on the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instantaneous perception of confusion immediately made Richard pale, and the body began to tremble involuntarily, but this feeling was so real, so that he could not judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Modred is discussing the issue of Richard’s tuition with Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults said, please look at the past sentiment and carefully teach the young master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The past love? Well, I remember, the Marquis in your family still owes me a lot of materials without paying the bill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Has the gold part been paid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about interest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing with a legendary mage The numbers are extremely unwise, and Modred immediately shifted the topic and threw a second card: "Master Richard has a superb magical talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, every year I want to follow my genius to learn magic, there are dozens of dozens! Even the gods I have to reject three or four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred A serious face throws a card: "The young master is running the blood of Archimonde, and its purity is almost the same as that of the adults. At least in this generation of Archimonde, no one can compare."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Ningding Yan legendary Master eyes suddenly bright, just let the whole magic hall whom flicker for a moment, like to see the dragon jewelry. Her tone is still calm, but everyone can see that it is just pretending: "So what can I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can arbitrarily "How can this be said that Modred, who is serious and bloodthirsty, can say it." In fact, this is the original words of the Marquis. However, when Modred was exported, it was still a subtle expression, and perhaps his heart was slightly different from his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s strangeness was also perceived by Su Helun and Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun thought thoughtfully and said slowly: "The little guy can actually sense the mana pool in my magic hall, but it is not easy. Well, following me to learn magic, I am barely qualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is!" Modred said with a smile. But what he thought was, this is the magic hall made of abyss crystal! The strength of the magic can be felt even by his knight of pure force. Is it not easy? This excuse is too far-fetched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, this is not enough." Su Hailun added, "The two planes in the hands of Gordon’s little guy are good, I want ten years. Revenue, whatever you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slot time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, promise Rand time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred's mouth twitched a little and finally nodded. This has slightly exceeded the bottom line of Gotton's confession, but it is barely acceptable. In the entire world system, Noland is one of the most high-level main planes, even if it is not the only main plane. According to the rules of the world space, the time flow rate of Noland is often slower than the time of the secondary plane. Noland's ten years may be hundreds of years in other planes. The bottom line of the original Marquis confession has been incredibly rich, but this is half of Gotton’s gains, which will inevitably affect his future expansion plans. You know, Gordon’s next goal is to enter the imperial capital, the legendary city of Faust. If you want to stand in that place, no matter how abundant the material preparation is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Modred remembered that Su Helun quietly passed a prefix between the top talents in the league, "blood-sucking..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her other maxim is widely known: "I am not necessarily the strongest, but it will be the richest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Su Hailun said: "At the next prayer ceremony of the Eternal Dragon Temple, I will give Xiaotangton some help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mordred’s heart was loose, which was consistent with the bottom line that the Marquis confessed. But he immediately evoked a strange feeling. One such great thing was that he did not go through a lot of trials and bargaining. The two sides quickly sold on the bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a tacit understanding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important task has been successfully completed, and Modred immediately left. When he left, he finally couldn't help but look back at Richard and his eyes were complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stacking the total proceeds of a plane for more than 100 years, no matter what shape, anyone seeing it will be complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun waved his hand gently, and the 18th-level masters above the 12th level in the hall immediately quit quietly, leaving only Su Helun and Still in the face of Richard, who is struggling to resist the magic. Although the sweat has already soaked the clothes, Richard still supports the failure, and the resilience that has been exercised since childhood has finally shown its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage on the Crystal Throne gently bounced his fingers, and the two finger cots collided and made a sound. The magic tides hidden in the underground mana pool slowly subsided, and the endless illusions in Richard's mind were eliminated. When the focus of the entire magic tide is concentrated on Xiao Licha, he is a magical idiot, and can also show the magic talent of ‘superb.’ This is a small means, and Modred will definitely see it, and Su Helun does not mean to hide. Other means and excuses that are more clever and concealed are not without, but she is too lazy to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is worse, it can be considered as a reason. Even if Mordred saw through the wrists of Su Helun, he would not dare to say it. This is the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
