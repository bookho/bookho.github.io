			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard asked a key question: "The god of whiteness Why do you want to attack the lady of the night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark said: "Mrs. Night is lagging behind, her divinity and priesthood are absorbed by the god of day, so the god of daylight From a weak divine power to a medium divine power, and officially changed its name to the god of time Luna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a secret, if it is true, then no doubt It will be the most secret event of the entire plane. Once leaked and spread, it will surely provoke the anger of Luna, the god of time. Moreover, judging from the experience of the Sundial Church, it is obvious that the gods of the Faro plane will not like the rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Clark, why do you think that my guard is a sundial? You see, its power is still very weak." I don't think that the twilight will be a sundial, but I am interested in this mysterious organization in Clark's mouth. From Clark's narrative, the Sundial Church is simply a natural ally of Richard in the Faro plane. Just don't know where they put the plane and the gods ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With both darkness and divinity, this is a common feature of all Sundial Churches, and is unique," Clark said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divinity is not something that anyone can have. If a mortal has divinity, it is like carrying a bag full of gold coins, which will inevitably invite the intervention of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned, the hand on the table tapped on the table, faintly asked: "The Sundial Church seems to be the most desirable prey of the gods. Since You have determined that this guard is the Sundial Church, then, I should soon see the Holy Sepulchre and the Knights of the Temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark's mouth touched, revealing a bitter smile, saying: "The divinity of the Sundial Church is hidden in the depths of the soul, even the gods have no way to spy. They may be strong, perhaps weak, but can detect the existence of the Sundial Church. It must be another Sundial Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha was amazed and said, "Don't you, too..."<br /><br /> Clarke nodded, then looked at the twilight and said, "Hello, you can transfer this guard to me. I can enlighten her and lead her to truly belong to the sun." The power of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li said without hesitation: "This is impossible."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色 is the creation of the mother's nest, the darkness comes from the sinker, and the divinity comes from the totems of many ancestors. It is not a sundial, it is impossible to let Clark lead. power. And now the six-level twilight is one of the main strengths of Richard's future, how can it be handed over to Clark? No matter what conditions Clark has opened, there is no room for discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark was obviously unwilling to test it several times. Seeing that Richard was determined to be firm, he had to put aside the idea of ​​getting a twilight for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha ended the topic: "Okay, dear Mr. Clark, let's discuss the cooperation with the Gun of the Demon Hunt! You can rest assured, I He will keep his mouth shut for everything he just heard." He looked at the twilight that was completely shrunk in the corner, "even for my companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark After leaning against it, it reveals a smile of unknown meaning. "I certainly believe in your credibility. Next, Lord Richard, what do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
