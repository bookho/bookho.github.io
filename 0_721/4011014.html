			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The process of refusal will be very painful, the master. The information after the instruction is directed at me, it will bring me great pain. When the mother's nest replied, the voice shook, and it seemed to have endured the pain of irresistible resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It adds: "If the reapers find that the instructions are invalid, they should continue to increase their strength, and I always have time to resist."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" Richard asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mother's nest has no solution, then he only has the risk of attacking the reaper's mother ship. This is not all for the mother's nest, but also for the hundreds of millions of people that Faro can't withdraw, and the three goddesses and other people who follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest is difficult to answer, and of course it is impossible to deal with the control instructions in its soul memory. Everything must be done by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyebrows and said: "Give me all the information about the control instructions that you know, let me analyze!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, massive amounts of information were sent from the nest to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the reaper sent the message again and communicated to Richard and the mother's nest through the flying beast. In the turbulent land, the mother's nest suddenly sounded like a whistling sound like a whistling sound. The huge abdomen was raised high and fell heavily, and a deep pit was shot directly on the ground. The nests within a few hundred meters of the vicinity were shaken and slanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the mother's nest is extremely painful and does not use sharp limbs to plan the ground. A large amount of acid mist is also emitted from the vent hole of the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest gives a short and sharp whistle, and the surrounding worm nest forest begins to sway, constantly releasing a thick mist, forming a barrier covering the entire worm Over the nest. But this is useless, because the mother nest receives the information through the scouting beast. This is the soul link. Unless the beast is blew, the mother's nest will continue to receive control commands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul-filling plan is just to give the mother's nest the ability to think independently, but the control instructions also add mandatory information that can cause great pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information hen has no ability to resist, only to find a way to shield it. However, in order to completely shield, the mother's nest will only give up the command of the armored combat unit, otherwise it can be sent to the mother's nest through the soul link. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is also aware of the dangers, and now is not the time to study the relationship between the nest and the Reaper and the Dragon of Eternal and Time. It is imperative to find a way to stabilize the mother's nest. Otherwise, once it is controlled by the reaper, it will be completely over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will blast the flying beast immediately!" Richard categorically ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the flying beast did not blew as much as Richard expected, but continued to observe the movement of the Reaper base and continually sent back images. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the mother's nest is coming on and off: "Master, I... want a free soul. So I will..... Persevere. Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare order for the mother's nest to explicitly reject Richard. But Richard also knows how much it costs. The most unbearable thing is the torture of the soul. The pain caused by the reaper's control orders can be said to exceed all the imaginable pains in the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been overwhelmed at the moment. He does not know how long the mother's nest can last and does not know what action to take. This crisis may be the biggest crisis he has faced in his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, no one knows when it appears behind Richard. She slammed on Richard's shoulder and said, "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and saw no face, immediately thinking about his mother. The crisis of the nest was said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to think about, said to Richard: "If you still have a link to the soul of the mother's nest, then you can choose to share the damage, you can also share "Painful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't say it early!" Richard was surprised and happy, and immediately chose to share the soul and pain with the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face yelling "Wait!", but Richard has already completed the choice, so that the mother's nest can't wait to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the link to share the painful soul was established, Richard’s face suddenly disappeared completely, with a few clicks and a molar on the spot. He snorted and fell to his head and his hands trembled unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Richard suffered a lot of pain, he never thought it would be so painful! This is only half the pain shared from the mother's nest, so that he wakes up several times in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Richard only slightly adapted to this pain, but has completely lost his ability to act, and his entire will is used to fight against pain. Only then can I guarantee that I will not faint again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blurs his face and looks at him, as if he is talking non-stop, but Richard can only hear her voice, but can’t understand it at all. Which means it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is desperately fighting against the pain and finally adapts slowly. But the deep feeling of putting the soul in the furnace for calcination and then immersing it in the ice water is a long-lasting feeling that has allowed Richard to have a time of hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the pain that Richard took was suddenly light, and actually lost more than half of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard, who gradually recovered consciousness, discovered that there was another passage in his soul, and that pain was diverted along this passage. Go out and pass it on to another person. The other end of the channel is water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the girl is hiding in the corner of the room, her body is shaking, and the corners of her mouth begin to seep out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aware that the amount of pain in the past was too great, and I immediately intercepted most of the time and stayed at a level where I could barely have a clear will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another soul link was built, and the pain was split again. This time, the soul link is extraordinarily strong, and careful observation is actually composed of two parallel soul channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the soul link of the Ogre Lord. Although it takes half the weight of all the pain, the ogre seems quite relaxed, but His body temperature began to rise sharply and energy was quickly consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, the reaction was tiramisu and hungry, so he began to search for food in a frenzied camp. It is not lacking to eat now. The military food originally prepared for the 100,000 army is now consumed by only a few thousand people. The extra part is enough to hold Tiramisu back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre's temperament is simple, the more such willpower is, the stronger it is. And it has two souls, which can be shared by each other. Finally, it is a powerful vitality that makes the ogre's tolerance to suffering multiply. In this respect, it is even stronger than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of the ogre, Richard suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then there are several soul links built, except for the Elf poet Oral, the rest are the new legends of Iron Shield and Keane. The strong, the legendary killer who has been with the iron shield for a while has also joined. What surprised Richard was that there was actually an extraordinarily small passage of soul from Romney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral is the oldest follower. Although his talent is limited, his ability to break through the sanctuary has reached its limit. But the soul power has been growing steadily. He is already familiar with the soul link between Richard and Richard. In addition to him, the rest of the Sanctuary wants to share the soul attack that Richard can't afford, and it is completely looking for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Romney’s moth-like move made Licha feel moved and laughed. But in order to let the weak killer know the consequences of the action, Richard gave him some pain. This pain was sent to the past, and Romney suddenly screamed and fainted on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a lot of followers sharing, Richard was a lot easier. Now the pain he carries has not affected the action at all, but can be used as a sharpening stone to sharpen the strength of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest has also stabilized, and it has received the upper limit of pain that it can withstand. The extra part will be sent to Richard. Then Richard decides whether to take more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soul network is generated, and people in the network share the pain. Soon the Iron Shield and the legendary killer also made a shocking and happy call: "This pain can actually increase the strength of the soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately found each other The existence of it, then snorted at the same time, and at the same time quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
