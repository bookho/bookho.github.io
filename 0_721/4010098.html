Therefore, the sand is ready to disguise itself as a priest who revives the ancient god. She is very good at the analysis and use of divine power. She knows that the power of time is close to the divine nature of the god of time, so it is most likely to conflict with her followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most likely occurrence of the coalition should be the pastor of the stable god Xerxes, although the eternal and the dragon of time also have powerful spatial attributes, but so powerful The attributes must be at a very high level to be reflected. Clarke has a veteran experience, and the fighting sergeant Iowa is more sophisticated in applying power to the gods. It should not reveal flaws and cause the Xerxes believers to be alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, there are a large number of well-documented local priests, such as Kas, Marvin, etc., which proves that they believe in a revived ancient God. Sissau, who is not a fallen pastor, is excellent evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest variable of the whole plan is still Heim, the viscount once again shows the heroic spirit and the real riches, and finally contributed to Richard. One third of the force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that even the various vassals of the Duke of the Wolf are only a quarter of the troops. The rest are the forces that the little aristocrats who want to venture and make a fortune put together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the robbing of the dragon, the Duke of the Wolf is fully resisting the revenge of the Principality of Baiyan, and the strength is tight everywhere. It is quite difficult to get these forces to support Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the reality of Him’s watch is abnormal, then Richard decided to talk to him well, this thing should be done when the Viscount is uncharacteristically coming to the Oasis. However, it was delayed for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the night fell, Shim came to Richard’s residence on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha prepared refreshments on the terrace to entertain the Viscount. At this time, it is the time when the bright red moon on the blood-stained land is the largest and the most round. The human visual vision stands on the earth and looks at the volume. It is even several times larger than the sun. In it, you can even see the huge rolling hills of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has always been such a legend, behind the moon is the god of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in front of Richard, Him is obviously a bit restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still full of bruises, one eye is swollen and purple, and the gods are used to warm the body’s scary wounds. No such surface damage is allowed. But only those aristocrats who don’t know the truth will laugh at the wolverine figure of a magician after a melee, and seeing the wounds of Richard and Io’s bloody war, seeing these scars, will only feel the bottom of my heart. Fear. Moreover, the experience of the first two in the hands of Richard is still a huge shadow, and those pains and fears are now re-emerged from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee poured a cup of tea for Him and pushed it to the Viscount and said, "There is nothing too good here. This tea is already I can come up with." The best thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him was flattered, toasted and sipped, and then burned straight out his tongue, his white face swelled red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at him and asked, "Are you coming this time just to make a possible profit for the line plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him hesitated, but Under the gaze of Richard's gaze, he apparently began to sweat, and finally said: "This is the last batch of troops supported by my father and the Duke. I will rely on my own income to maintain it in the future. Your plan Once successful, I can earn a lot of gold coins, so that I can continue to expand the strength of the territory. This is a seemingly crazy plan, but I know that if you command, it is very likely to succeed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, you should come over and go to me after you have been caught for the second time." Richard clearly expressed doubts. At the same time staring at Him's eyes, not letting go of even the smallest reaction, wondering whether he knows or participates in some deeper things, or that he has made another shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xim rubbed the cold sweat that was constantly emerging, apparently remembering those unbearable pasts, struggling to say: "No! You have not fully displayed at that time." How can I bet on you if you are convincing, but you killed Odom, and he took him to the elite knight, which is different. It is worthy of you to make a big note." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to ask: "What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?" I started sweating again. In the end, under Richard’s gaze, he finally gave up the final resistance and said: “There are actually two reasons. One is that our family has lost too much in your hands. If you fight with you, the benefits are not enough. Convince the family council, if you still use the private army, it will shake us to the roots. Fortunately, the Duke of the Wolf recently was also badly hurt in the war with the Principality of Baiyan, otherwise the situation would not be good. I did not expect you to give I sent an invitation letter, although I know that your initial thoughts were just a joke, but it was a chance for me to catch. So I came because I know that people like you will not easily eat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Him’s cheeky, Richard is also helpless, but from another perspective, he is not a complete waste, or even a A lot of advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue, there is a second reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The father and the duke hope Can get some makeup and advanced enchanting weapons. Of course, the price will definitely satisfy you!" said Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "What these things mean, you should be very clear. Will I arm my enemy? Willing? If you are, you can go to the market to buy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advanced enchantment equipment and the same structure, need to be scaled, and truly powerful. Therefore, the method that Richard has always adopted is to distribute a large number of enchanting equipment to various forces. As long as it is not used in a large amount, it will not pose a great threat to Richard himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a means of consuming the wealth of the Faroese nobility, allowing Richard to quickly accumulate a large amount of wealth, thus gaining the first between the planes Bucket of gold. In addition, when the mindful person collects enough enchanting equipment, it will find that Richard's strength has taken a big step forward, and they have long been left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heim said with a naive hope: "We are no longer an enemy? This time you plan your line, I put my own private Armed, and the soldiers that can be borrowed are all brought out! After fighting side by side, they should be even comrades-in-arms. What's more, we were originally a little insignificant hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Insignificant hatred?" Richard laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing a sanctuary, several great magicians and priests, plus elite troops that annihilate thousands of people, is this also called insignificant hatred? But looking at Him's sincere eyes and sincere tone, Richard finally understood that perhaps in the eyes of the unicorn Viscount, the real hatred between himself and him was the two fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard immediately found out that he was not as stupid as he showed. And from the point of view of this guy staring at himself, there must be the following, or else it will not be such an extremely expectant, but uneasy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what else?" Richard asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Hem was shocked, and finally finally said: "That... there is still a small thing, it is my personal business. But how to say it, the father and the Duke also know, they are acquiescence. This is the case, some time ago, I have a woman, the Countess Ekaterina, the niece of the king. She died her husband very early. This is only twenty-six years old. The purpose of her coming to me is to get a child, a child who may awaken the blood of the unicorn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard didn't mean to smile and said, "Is this not a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him’s face was pale and said: "I am with her for four months. There have been no signs of children in the past. In these four months, except for those days, almost... almost at least two or three times a day! This kind of day is crazy! She is a woman who needs nothing. And I drove away all my women! I really can’t stand it, so I ran to the blood-stained land, I hope I can temporarily Get rid of her. She had a lot of lovers, as long as I don't go back, I don't believe she can stand for a month without looking for a man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him's eyes are full of sympathy, saying: "This kind of day is not easy. But... do you want to use me as a shield?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Not afraid of that woman, and his lover!" Heim cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not afraid, but it does not mean that I want to be used." Richard teas and said leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him argues: "I have contributed the most troops for your line plan! And I am responsible for the supply!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "This price is enough. However, you don't even think about those enchanting equipment and structures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hem screamed: "No! I can't get those, I will be recalled to the family soon, and I will continue to use it for the woman! How much I can, I can pay twice the price on the market!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xim White is obese, but it seems to be quite clean, just a little distance from the handsome word. Being able to pull people like Him to 'breed', and at least two or three times a day, so that they all left a psychological shadow on Him, indicating that the woman’s taste is not ordinary, and the other possibility is a one-horn The attraction of the blood of the beast is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that in the sacrifice before the arrival of Faro, the third blood option given by the dragon of eternal and time Includes the blood of the holy unicorn! From the list, this is the blood that can be compared with the dragon and the young star beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
