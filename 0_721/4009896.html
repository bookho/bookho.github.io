			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short and fierce battle. Ten minutes later, all the members of the slave team became corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves of the slain team have the tenth weakest, the most powerful leader is the thirteenth, and their desperate counterattacks let the sandmen of Richard The number of knights has shrunk to seventy, and several of the barbarians and half-orcs have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after getting the slaves of the barbarians, Richard added 30 more brutal warriors, who swear allegiance to Richard in the name of the ancestor . In return, Richard released other barbarian slaves and asked them to return to their ancestral highlands on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is surprisingly smooth. The barbarian of the Xuefeng tribe explained to his compatriots the kindness of Richard: you can gain freedom by killing twenty enemies. It is not difficult to kill twenty people in a blood-stained place where there is no war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the dead slave team members, their value is maximized. Sandru successfully turned more than half of the bodies into black warriors. Although the Undead Master does not have hundreds of undead army, he has an elite permanent summoning squad. This is the request of Richard, and it also conforms to the war ideas of Noland's mainland. Pure sea tactics have no effect. Under the premise of a certain number, elite high-end fighters can destroy any number of low-grade cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearing a red-collecting team of the Cossacks, Richard continued to carry the team in the blood-stained place for purposeless safari. In the next half of the month, there were no fewer than ten battles. Richard also eliminated two other slave teams and fought several horses with hundreds of horses. During this period, he also took a small caravan. However, Richard eventually collected the goods of the caravan in the form of a transaction, although the exchange price was only equivalent to the purchase price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the endless fierce battle, there are more than 300 slave soldiers in the army of Richard, and the barbarian warriors have crossed the 100 mark and 6 The Shamin warriors and the eleven barbarian warriors completed the standard of killing the enemy and got the freedom and gold coins. The barbarians are deeply in love with their homeland, and all the barbarians who are free have chosen to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s tolerance and commitment have also paid off, and all the barbarian warriors that have not been reached for the time being are left with peace of mind, bravely fighting, and will persuade other barbarians The slaves swear allegiance to Richard in exchange for future freedom. Therefore, the number of Barbarian warriors in Richard is rapidly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sand people are different. In a short period of time, there have been five incidents in which the slaves of the Saudis fled, and even the entire team fled. However, although they are the beasts in the wilderness, the water is the son of the night and the wild, and even the other people are not dispatched. The girls themselves have completed all the work of killing the traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s treatment of the Shamins also abides by the promises, which means that there is also a brutality in addition to tolerance. There are five captains, along with a dozen sand people who have not been involved in the fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the Shamin fighters who have gained freedom have chosen to stay. The land where the sand people live is the desert zone in the northwest, but their settlements have been completely destroyed when they are captured, and they are homeless to go back. On the other hand, the fierce sand people are obviously more interested in the gold coins that Richard rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is always dead, and some people are harvesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war, Richard finally broke through the tenth level, and the blood of the elf continued to manifest itself, gaining the ability of natural affinity. This is a passive ability that reinforces all the magic associated with nature and enhances the ability of Richard to perceive and conceal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre brothers also rose to the 11th level, they all got the 'tough' ability, the body is stronger, the endurance, vitality and resilience are also more outstanding. From this ability, Tiramisu is advancing along the path of the violent mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s promotion speed surprised Richard, and even rushed into the 12th level, although it was not stable. This strong and sturdy guy finally took a two-step lead, but the girl was already at the 11th level. A girl who has a night breathing is that Gangde is not a rival. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the players are advancing or approaching the edge of the promotion, the captains who have experienced countless battles have not upgraded one by one, and only one of the stepping knights One person rose to the eleventh level. The difference between talent and candidate finally began to appear at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, the greatest increase in combat effectiveness is actually the undead mage, Sandro. The Necromancer has owned nearly twenty black warriors who can be summoned forever, but his full magic can only support ten black warriors at the same time. But in any case, the black warriors are self-defense in the presence of more than 12 levels, although their reaction is somewhat slow, but the real combat power is also more than eleven. Ten black warriors have become a decisive force on a small battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this month, Richard gradually became famous in the blood-stained place, and many horses, mercenaries, caravans and slaves know more. This is a new force, but it is nothing more. If there is a big blood-staining place, there will be new forces every day. Every day, the old forces will die. Only power and gold coins are the eternal order of this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily life is the same, and in the feeling of Richard, this month seems to have been as long as a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the red world, the red memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I wake up every morning, Richard’s eyes are red. When you stepped forward, the eyes were all red land and rocks. The battle is also a splash of red, that is the color of the blood. Even at night, there are deep dark red everywhere, like dry blood. In chaos and killing, red and blood have merged into one, and they can no longer separate each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this bloody world, two more battle knights left Richard forever. But the living people are still too late to feel sad and nostalgic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, near dusk, Richard climbed a pinnacle, squatting on the edge of the cliff, looking down from the top to the orc camp in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small orc tribe with about two hundred members. The camp consists of dozens of tents, large and small. There is also an altar behind the camp. A sorcerer with bright colors is dancing in front of the altar. The thick and heavy drums are constantly ringing, and far from it, the heart of Richard has a tendency to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp center has already ignited a bonfire, and the female and the old man began to prepare food at the fire. Several young orcs are fighting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and the water bloom are hovering around Richard, while observing the camp. Behind them, an orc hunter and his domesticated wasteland wolf fell into a pool of blood and became a dead body. This pinnacle is in an excellent position to capture the movements within a few kilometers of the square. So the tribe placed a hunter on this pinnacle as a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
