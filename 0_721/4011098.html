			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera nodded hard: "They used to come several times a day. I spent a lot of effort to kill them. Now it's less!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Serra again, Richard's look is a bit complicated. Despite the help of the star screen and the plasma ball, Sera can actually kill all the reapers who rushed into the star screen, which is not something that the legendary powerhouse can do. It can be seen that under the tender appearance, Sera has a powerful force that is completely incompatible with the age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei stretched out his hand and said, "Let's go, let's go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sela put his little hand in Richard's palm and asked: "Where is the family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "In a light The world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, both Sera and Su Helun came to Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is still asleep, only back to one side of the light, where it is supplemented by Star Power, her injury will be restored, and really wake up. Now, she still needs to sleep for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you sleep, there will be a leap of power for the ancient stars. In fact, when she saw Serra, Richard knew that she was the daughter of Su Hailun. Because Sera looks exactly the same as the ancient star family, but the appearance of Su Helun is completely human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Shide slowly turned around and set sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera asks: "Are we going home now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "No, I have to wait a little longer, there is a bad person here. I want to kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I will go with my mother." Looking at the eternal book of Richard's waist, he suddenly said, "I want this book!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at it, then shakes his head Said: "It is not something you can use now. Wait until you grow up and say something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera took a deep look at Richard and said, "I will grow up soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little girl who ran out, Richard sighed helplessly A tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Eternity is beyond his ability, until now Richard has not figured out all its secrets. Just like the crystal plate of fate in your hand, the book of Eternity is also an artifact with the power of destiny. No matter who gets it, it will be intertwined with its fate, thus deviating from its original destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deviation is inevitable. In many religions, it may be called cause and effect, and it will also be called fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the book of Eternity, originally known as the book of destiny. Now Richard has some understanding why St. Martin gave the book of destiny to himself. This guy obviously wants to get rid of an established fate and then chooses himself as a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard did not suffer. In the past battles, the book of Eternity brought him many advantages. In other words, through the book of Eternity, you can actually control the power of fate. In fact, it is to let Richard get in touch with the rules of the bottom of the world in advance, thus clearing the obstacles of Richard's promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera may feel the attraction of the book of Eternity and will want it. But the more so, the more Richard will not give her the Book of Eternity. He does not want his child to bear the same fate from now on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sera left Richard’s room and ran to the sleeping area of ​​Su Hailun. She suddenly stopped, her eyes turned cold, and quietly looked at the beautiful girl who was burning like the opposite, Freire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire whispered: "The book of Eternity is mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dream !" Sera is not welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire suddenly smiled and said, "Do you want me to solve you with violence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sera sneer, she is born with the pride of looking down on all beings, indifferent replies: "You don't dare to do it here. When you return to one side of the light, my strength will recover immediately, and I will call you at that time." Half dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freire's eyes are cold, but he laughs but is charming and enchanting: "Little guy, you are very confident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera said coldly: "I am not confident. But your knowledge is too short. Unlike our father, we are totally dependent on blood strength. Do you think that you will surpass me in this respect, a lower bloodline!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sera strode away and passed away with Freire, and did not even look at her. Freire's fingertips ignited a black prison fire, but did not dare to shoot out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Miracles now looks like a trace of war, except for the floating island of the console, the remaining floating islands Three. The volcanic hull is also full of traces of bombardment by high-energy beams or kinetic energy. Even after Richard saw the scene, it was a bit strange how the city of miracles survived from such a huge reaper fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an original deep underground hall, Richard found the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the night elves stayed in this hall, linking themselves to the circle of law in the hall, silently contributing to power. Tens of thousands of night elves close to the sanctuary level have enormous vitality, which is even larger than the energy extracted by the vaginal air from the void, perhaps second only to the energy produced by the decomposition of the essence of the embers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly looked around and suddenly understood that this underground hall should be built from the time of construction to extract a lot of vitality as a vagrant energy. supplement. The creatures who enter this hall, of course, will not be the races that control vagrants, but the powerful creatures they capture from all planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is able to extract energy from the void, and to gain vitality from the broken plane, the power of the floating world will never fail. There are the defenses of the rainbow in July, and the attack of the seven-column crystal. Except for the strongest who is already standing at the peak of the world like Richard, I can't think of any other force that can make it fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is that fait is falling on Noland, and all the information about the race that created it and used it is annihilated in the long river of history. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this thought, Richard can not help but deeply instigate the power and mystery of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Shide sailed in the void, leaving behind a chaotic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, there was a strange place in the distance, there was light. It is not an ordinary chaotic continent, but a magnificent fortress built of metal, shaped like a giant tower, up to thousands of kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower has numerous tower bridges that extend outwards, and a large number of reaper warships fly in and out of the tower bridge, looking far away, like a huge honeycomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! My dear little builder, you actually found it here! This really surprised me, even with my omniscient Ability, but also can not accurately determine what you can achieve. This is a small mistake, but it can not be forgiven! I will quickly self-improvement, make up this last loophole. As for you, you should feel for yourself Proud, you are here, it represents the second great thing in all life in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not accidentally hear this chattering sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew out of faucet and flew to the metal tower, asking: "Who is the first sacred? Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the voice suddenly rises eight degrees: "Of course! Of course it is me! You don't think I am going crazy, in fact, the dream I am chasing is entirely you, And the creatures of all the light can't imagine it! It's a real miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "Whatever your dream is?" Since then, the reaper will never appear in the world again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice suddenly laughed and laughed. He laughed desperately and sneered: "Ignorance! Childish! Stupid! Self-righteous! You are a pile of reptiles, guarding a piece of carrion and thinking that you have the treasure of the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the madness of the face, Richard is not angry, but thoughtfully, "So, I "Is the understanding wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, of course! Cute little builder, you don't understand the nature of the reaper! You thought I had wiped out, wrecked. Can this metal fortress destroy the reaper? No, no, no, the reaper will keep appearing, you can destroy some, maybe you think that the essence of the embers is all? But even if you take it all, They will still appear more! It will not be completely destroyed at all, because they are simply the creation of the rules of the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shocking assertion, but Richard does not know what to refute. Because he has a vague intuition, the truth seems to be not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he hesitated to talk to the madman who claimed to be the first sacred, the voice was impatient: "Okay! Everything So far! You can die in the final level of annihilation, your life has a supreme value! The light of annihilation is a weapon that has never been used passively, and is the ultimate power of the dark side of the world! Proud, Reptile!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the treble of the aria, a thin black glow is shot from the top of the tower. It's almost impossible to capture with visuals, and it doesn't seem to be fast. But when it appeared, the tens of thousands of kilometers around the giant tower seemed to be brighter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the shadow of death is shrouded in Richard’s mind. Since becoming a superpower, this is the second time that I really feel that death is so close! For the first time, it was the moment when Gordon broke his sword into the dark. But the moment of death is far less intense than it is now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Sword of the Gotham is the power of the abyss of the whole Abis, then this annihilation beam is the power that condenses the dark side of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so powerful, it’s all about the power of rules. If you can't suppress the power of the rules attached to it, then any tangible thing can't be blocked, and it will be turned into nothingness. Such a annihilation of light, if it appears on one side of the light, immediately forms a terrible chain reaction. It will destroy the huge world like the domain of dawn, destroy the space structure, and finally form a second eternal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ultimate power of the annihilation of light, the dark side of the world. With it, the reaper actually doesn't need any powerful weapons, because that doesn't make sense at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cold and cold, and he never thought that the world would have the power of annihilation. Today, Richard is very close to the limits of the world in every respect, but to resist the light of annihilation, this is not enough. He needs to reach the limit in many aspects of defense, strength, soul, and so on! But as Richard said before, such a life cannot exist in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it really going to die? When hope is in sight? Richard thought, the brain is already blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
