			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland has long studied the power of blood, the power of blood It does not come out of thin air. Depending on the occupation of the owner, it will absorb magic, vindictiveness, and even star power, ground fire, and monthly strength to strengthen itself, thus inspiring a variety of powerful or useless capabilities. Therefore, in addition to a handful of lucky people born with the innate nature, high-level professionals are always more likely to awaken their blood. And if Richard has more than one kind of blood, he often faces the problem of choice. Which kind of blood power is used much, it will get enough development, and it will become more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard continues to silence consciousness, and the soul power gradually rises. The magic in his body began to spread out of the body and constantly sensed something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fluctuation of the magic, the layers of the squad are pushed to the sea of ​​consciousness that is still silent in the darkness. The colored starburst is captured by the magic and then introduced into the body. Then Richard's magic will grow stronger. After the blue starburst enters the body, it melts, but dyes a small piece of magic around it into aqua blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Su Hailun’s unique introduction to meditation, Deep Blue Fantasy. Meditation with dark blue fantasy, inspired by a water-blue star with unclear attributes, rather than ordinary magic. This kind of water blue power is similar to the star power, but it is different, but it can replace all magical functions. Richard has not yet discovered that they have their own unique power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each water blue star is a magical increment of 0.1. During the meditation process, Richard can capture one to three stars per hour. This efficiency is three times that of ordinary meditation! Richard only reached level 10 before he could start using dark blue fantasy. From this point, we can also see the power of the dark blue heritage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's meditation is not going well, Richard is too late to enter the depth of meditation, so until the first hour is coming to an end, the first one is captured. Water blue star. After the star-studded body, the blood of Akmon suddenly pulsed strongly, and the water blue star was inhaled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Archimonde’s blood has taken the initiative to extract strength, and then suddenly released a picture in Richard’s consciousness. This picture is very familiar, and Richard has captured a piece of the future about the harvest of God, that is Su Hailun, Su Hailun floating in the endless void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly opened his eyes and squirted a blood, the blood did not splash and land, but directly in the air to boil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The door of Richard's door was pushed open, and the sand flowing next to it rushed in. He saw that he just saw the rising blood of the group and lost his voice: "What happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two brushes, water and smudges rushed in one after the other. They all have a close relationship with Richard. In the first time, they feel a wave of shaking from the soul level. The sorrow is like a haze, and it seems to be swallowing up the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the body swayed, feeling extremely exhausted and weak, and involuntarily leaned on the sand. His face was pale, his eyes closed, and he said softly: "I am fine, just... I want to go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard’s mouth In the overflowing blood, the flowing sand held him tightly and said, "We will go back, it will be soon! What happened to you, don't... don't scare me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to wipe the blood on Richard's face, but the cold hand was shaking, but it made a lot of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood bubble that Li spit out contains a strong magical atmosphere, and the ultimate disaster of the Master: the magic disintegration is very similar. When the sand came into the door, when I saw the rising blood fog, the consciousness was already blank, and the gods who were as quiet as water were no longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she clung to the boy in her arms, helpless like an ordinary girl. Although there is no connection between the souls, but the sorrow that she can also perceive despair is inextricably revealed from the depths of the soul of Richard, and several will completely obscure the glory of the last point of consciousness, and the heavy slamming of the collapse of the entire starry sky, She didn't even have the power to reach out to stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is standing on the side, holding the hand of the perpetual guide, but not knowing what to do. She will only kill people and will not save people. Although the slender five fingers are no longer bloody, they also know that there is no place for the sleeper guides at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight standing in the corner suddenly said something bluntly. That is the god language, but it is one of the general proverbs of Noland, and the sand can be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is said: "God, cure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woke up, this reminds me that I am a ten-level god. She straightened Richard and then quickly recited the spell and prepared the magic. Healing can't reverse the magical disintegration, but it can heal the damage caused by the magical disintegration. It’s just that this quicksand is familiar with the magic that can be cast in almost dreams. At this time, it has been mistaken twice, only to be cast out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of healing instantly infiltrated into the body of Richard, making his pale face more bloody. The strong pulsating Archimonde's blood finally calmed down, and the magic of a mess was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li closed his eyes, took a break, then opened his eyes and said, "I'm fine, just a little problem in meditation. You don't have to worry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow sand mouth opened Zhang, but did not ask again, but said: "Good... but can't meditate tonight, let the magic work fully "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and smiled as he was in peace, saying, "Okay, no problem. Now go back to rest!" Junxiu's outline, in the infinite restraint and perseverance on countless death blades, exudes indescribable charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. When the water and the ochre are the same as when they are, they turn into two shadows and leave quietly. When the sand came to the door, he suddenly turned back and said with a serious look: "We will go back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charming smile of Richard remains unchanged. Shaking his head said: "Don't worry. It's useless in this matter. Just do it step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" The sand was nodded hard, just Going back to your room and leaving Richard with a space to be alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lying down on the bed, but he couldn’t sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cure has already worked, and the power of the god activates the body's self-healing ability, so that all the wounds are repaired in a short time. The inevitable fatigue after the exhaustion of divine power has eroded every corner of Richard's body, making him only want to sleep. But as soon as you close your eyes, those thrilling future episodes will appear in front of you, lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
