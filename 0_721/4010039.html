			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the face of the moon has changed, Richard said faintly: I heard that the Black Wing is already entering the Sanctuary. I will soon be promoted to the next level and become a 12-level magician. Lord Lord, you said, after I become a great magician, can I kill? How do you put the sanctuary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Moon bears a heavy sigh, his face is ugly, but he has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s nothing to offend a 12-level master magician, but it’s not a pleasure to offend a great magician who is less than twenty years old. It’s a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lord Bear is silent, Richard is no longer difficult for him, but waved his hand to the sand. Can Long Yu be a sacrifice, or if she has seen it before she counts it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is carefully inspected by the dragon, and the skull of the dragon is carefully touched from top to bottom with both hands. The face has something strange, but because of the back Richard and Lord did not let them see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suppressed the tension in his heart and asked in the calmest tone: "How about sand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sand hourglasses appear in the depths of the sand, two amber lights illuminate the dragon, and nodded after a moment, saying: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a simple word, but the meaning inside is only known to Richard and Liusha. Richard took a deep breath and his heartbeat was slightly accelerated. Richard turned to the Lord of the Moon and said, "It is time to prepare for the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Moon nodded and said: "Need or not Need some people to help you guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "Yes, but behind is my magic lab, no one but you can enter This yard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Moon bears a sneak look at Richard, striding out of the courtyard and telling the 50 knights to guard the various points around the hotel. He himself took the rest of the three hundred knights and led to the camp under the leadership of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​blood is undoubtedly very dangerous, but it is only for ordinary people. For Lord Bear, the edge of the blood-stained land is no different from the smooth road, and it is even less likely to threaten the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard and Liusha returned to the room, Richard asked again: "What you just said can be..." This fact is so important that it is so important that His voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands looked a little different and looked at Richard and asked: "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can we go back to Noland?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted down and said in a casual tone: “Are you eager to go back?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly asked: "Don't you worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course anxious!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is not in a hurry?" Richard laughed happily and smiled dryly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, don't let you worry. This dragonfly should be enough for us to get the coordinates of Noland." But she lowered her head and did not let Richard see her expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really!?" For Richard, the unexpected happiness is coming too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is looking up, smiles brightly, and says hard: "Real!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I took a handful of sand and took her for a few laps in the same place. Then I put it down and said, "Fortunately, there is you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you reward me?” The sand gaze at Richard, his eyes lit up like the stars in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say!" Richard said that he was so arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, I want to know what you have seen, will make you change so much." Liu Sha said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, I don’t understand why the flow sand will ask this question. Although it was under great joy, Richard still hesitated for a long time. If possible, he is not willing to let the sandpaper know the two pictures he saw. Because the instinct tells him that a girl who is generous will not be tolerant of such things. But the sand-splitting eyes are too sharp and too bright, which makes him unable to look directly. In the end, Richard had to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the consent of Richard, the quicksand immediately became very happy, hooked Richard’s neck with his arms and gently rubbed his lips with unique The hoarse voice said: "Before dawn until dawn, you are not allowed to go out of my body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a tragic war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually became more serious, then gritted his teeth and nodded hard. Looking at his gnashing teeth, the sand was laughing. Her publicity is unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was coming, the flamboyant and tragic war opened. If it is not for Richard to set up a mute enchantment, then the call of two people will spread throughout the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a war of will and endurance, and ultimately Richard did not insist on breaking. For the first time, the quicksand was completely invested in itself. There was no meaning of releasing water, and Richard was tortured to death. Even the Master of Richard, who is proud of it and the inheritance of the Dark Blue, cannot afford it. In the end, he can only let the sands raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard knows that the priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall are very good at close combat, and the quicksand is one of the best. When the war entered the second half, all of Richard’s intentions to turn over were ruthlessly suppressed by the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the end, Richard failed to stick to the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, Richard didn’t know what happened, and even the real talent couldn’t be erupted several times. The flowing sand, once changed the warmth of the past, completely turned into a fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After climbing to the peak of happiness, there was only one darkness in front of Richard’s eyes. In his last consciousness, there is only one last thought left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain, and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the intoxicating night, Richard slept very deeply. He has not slept for some time, and most of the night is spent in meditation. Because he was so tired, he felt very sweet, but he still woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
