			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sighed deeply and turned to step into the Light Gate. disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the pope from the gate of the Light, and did not stop it, and did not rush to the idea of ​​a dead war, in the other direction, holy Martin was equally calm and watched the Pope leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light of the Light disappeared slowly, and the platform built by the Light in the air also dissipated. The bodies of the bishops lost their senses and fell from the sky. The puff of the plops fell on the ground, and the noble body was buried in stucco and dust, just like the soldiers at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lufide is also among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Saint Martin, the Holy Light platform still exists, the platform is maintained by the power of St. Martin, and the battle on the platform is still going on, but It is far from being as intense as it was just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of Saints who belong to the church and there are still hundreds of people alive. In the face of opponents with only 50 people remaining, they are absolutely in the upper hand, and then insist on half. In an hour, St. Martin’s men will collapse, and it will be a one-sided slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a blink of an eye, Michael died and the jihad angels were all fallen, and the church’s cardinal group was swept away, even the backbone of the red The bishops have suffered heavy casualties. On the ground, St. Thomas has also been killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These saints are suddenly lost, even if they can win this partial battlefield, St. Martin and Richard will kill them when they come over. Clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at St. Martin and asked, "Why don't you chase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you chase." St. Martin smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not answer each other’s questions, but instead set their sights on the battlefield still in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly won’t chase, the Pope is almost unscathed, and there are two great artifacts, the Holy Robe and the Shining Staff, although I don’t know. The strength of the pope itself, but a guy who dares to intercept the faith and intends to seal himself is absolutely not good to deal with, and it is a step away from igniting the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the existing data, the Lord of Glory is probably the main god with powerful power, at least in the middle of the divine power, which is not weak or even weak power, and this is the main god of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the pope holding the two artifacts, really want to fight, I am afraid that most will be the super strong level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard, who is both the ash and the Medallion battle version, has a ruling and moonlight in hand, and at the same time got the antiquity In the heart of Archimonde's lord, all the conditions were combined, and Richard felt that he could fight the superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a battle, and there’s quite a distance from the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, even if Richard fights to kill the Pope, what good is it, after losing both, don't forget that there is another Saint Martin, Richard I don't know how much St. Martin's power is being used, but at least until now, he hasn't been hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Saint Martin is holding the same idea before he can leave the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time St. Martin raised his voice and said: "The believers of the Lord, the betrayers have failed. Now, in the name of the Son, I command you to lay down your weapons. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice spread throughout the battlefield, after the pope left, Lufide died, St. Martin is the highest figure in the presence of the church, and the Son has always been Appearing in the incarnation of God is the leader of the believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private leaders of the major lords stopped fighting first, which was not their war at all, and the church knights also gradually put down their weapons and soon fought It has subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a very small number of St. Thomas’s confidants are still stubborn and will not give up, but after losing the number advantage, they soon discovered that courage is simply not enough to make up for The huge gap in strength, in the blink of an eye, was killed by Richard's knights. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the faithful samurai also laid down their weapons, facing Saint Martin, expressing confession and vassal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the ground began to disengage, Richard’s troops quickly reorganized the lineup, there was still strength to fight on the periphery, and the wounded were placed in the middle to protect In the twinkling of an eye, it is a rigorous new battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the sect of the sacred tree dynasty, the troops are in a mess, fighting until now, many private military establishments have been disrupted, the soldiers are mixed together, each looking for their own team according to the banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Thomas’s adjutant gathered the surviving church knights, arrayed in the outer array, and protected the chaotic aristocratic private army behind him. The army of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the gap between the church knight and the aristocratic private army is very obvious, and compared with Archimonde, the holy tree dynasty and the bright church The 诩jīng sharp army also seems to be worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this moment, quality is one thing, and quantity is one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, Archimonde’s 30,000 troops have died and seriously injured more than 10,000 people, and then counted the lightly wounded who lost their fighting power. There are 17,000 people left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church and the dynasty’s army have more than 400,000 casualties, and there are nearly 70,000 casualties, but their remaining strength is still more than 250,000. Kemond’s lead has expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst loss is the church knight, the ten thousand knights brought by St. Thomas, and now only three thousand can still stand on the battlefield, on the side of Richard Two hundred members of the knights killed more than 30 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Holy Light platform, the holy warriors who were still fighting are now uniting their faith and becoming the same camp again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere on the battlefield suddenly became heavy, and the people who were still awkward gradually became quiet, even the wounded people seemed to feel something, endure pain, stop Oh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence suddenly comes, just like before the storm, the depression is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin was watching Richard, and Richard was watching Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast of power on the battlefield has quietly changed. Now Martin has become the orthodox of the Church of Light, and suddenly sits on a 250,000 army and hundreds of powerful In the Holy Warrior, in contrast, the strength of Richard’s hand is weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at the beginning of the war, Richard had the confidence to defeat St. Thomas in a series of campaigns, then seeing the current power contrast, Richard knew that he had only one choice: to sacrifice all the unhappy troops and wounded, and the nesting knight. Let the knights of the knights and the sharp Akmon Knights evacuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,000 soldiers, the last one who can return to Ashan in life should not exceed 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Richard did not issue any orders, nor did he let the troops retreat, or stood on the ground, standing in the arms of heaven: next to Michael, watching quietly With St. Martin, he didn't even have to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin suddenly smiled and glanced at the three Midrandes who were still in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Midranden stood quietly, each holding a sword, faintly ringing and arranging Richard, which is an arch, not surrounded, in fact, body The three saints in the middle of Midarun could not move at all, and their bodies have become a tool for supplying the energy of Midalun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and said: "Lee, it seems that you have already prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said: "Full preparation is at least not a bad thing, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin armed with the kingdom: Michael glanced at him and sighed. Say: "If I can have power beyond Michael now, maybe it will be different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can control everything, no one Can foresee everything." Richard calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin suddenly showed a big smile: "It makes sense, then the war is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha also laughed: "If you think the war is over, then it is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good." Saint Martin I started to be excited and started. "Since the war is over, then it’s time for the joyful moments of the forks, right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stunned, completely did not expect this The Son changed his mind in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
