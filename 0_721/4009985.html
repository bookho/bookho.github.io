			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hired workers and the sand people worked together to remove a body from the truck After sprinkling with antiseptics, they will be cast by Sandru. The spell of the Undead Master can drain the water from the corpse, and it can make the corpse not shrink too much, and keep the original appearance. As a 12th-level necromancer, Sandru can handle one body at a time, and two hundred bodies can be completed with only five spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Undead Master is somewhat dissatisfied with Richard’s practice of hanging the corpse. In his opinion, this is meaningless. Who will be scared by a corpse? ? It’s better to give it to him. These are obviously professional fighters. They have long-term exercise, and all of them are very strong. In the hands of the Necromancer, they will be converted into elite-level sergeants, which are all shielded. There are four or five fierce guys! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve-level Sandru, summoned undead creatures can only be reduced by two to three levels than before, if carefully prepared and assisted with a large number of magic potions There may even be a chance that it may not fall. It's just a lot of consumption, it's only worthwhile to make a black warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra hasn’t got high-quality raw materials for a long time, and Richard’s complaints about the Necromancer are just a smile. In his current conception of combat power, low-order undead creatures such as sergeants are not considered at all. Every magician can use the undead to summon, so small-scale use of undead creatures is not a problem. However, if there is a large-scale undead creature in the system, it can only indicate that there is a necromancer in the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Faro plane, the necromancer's degree of taboo is comparable to that of the Demon Summoner, second only to the ectopic invaders. It was not easy for Richard to integrate into the Faro plane, but he did not want to attract the attention of the gods again because of a squadron that could not play a decisive role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a deeper understanding of the Faro gods. Although Richard is also an alien invader, his attention to the 'insignificant' strength of entry is not significant. And shortly afterwards, there was the invasion of Sinclair, and it was fought several times with the Xerxes and the Temple of Nei, which struck the shrine power in the Sequoia Kingdom area, thus attracting the eyes that might have been bet on Richard. past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the agreement between Richard and the Duke of the Wolf, the identity issue was resolved, and the first invaders had no follow-up rumors, and the people of the Principality of White Rock gradually faded. The 'insignificant' ectopic invasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the temple of the gods, Richard is like a mosquito, although it is harmful but very small. The negligible meaning is that this mosquito can't irrigate any water, even if it is missing, it may die in a dark corner. People's attitude towards mosquitoes is to take a shot and not hit it. The gods are also true to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his home, and he now needs meditation to restore his magic. But he just sat down, and there was a rush of footsteps on the stairs, and the undead mage, Sandro, rushed into Richard's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw Richard, the Necromancer said with anger: "There is no soul in the body of the knight leader, so what can I take? Making black warriors? Now that I can summon less than five black warriors, do you want me to fight by curse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No soul?" A look at Richard. This can be unusual. After a typical person dies, it will take a few days for the body to rot highly, and the soul will completely dissipate. Otherwise, there will always be some residual fragments of the soul in the body. The Necromancer relies on the power of the soul to transform the body into an undead life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
