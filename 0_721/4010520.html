			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have your guardian, and I have my insistence. In order to get what we want, we have to pay the corresponding price. We all understand this truth. They are also willing to pay for it. Yes, all the pay is what we are willing to do. It is to put all the gold coins in the world together, and it is difficult to exchange our will, isn’t it.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s time for me to leave you, I will go to the dark areas to develop my faith, and Nye and I will also go with me, so in the years to come, you are likely There is no help from the eternal dragon temple priest, but it is still very important to find a way to get the help of the dragon temple priest. In Faro, the goddesses of the three goddesses, although not of much use, are better than no, maybe in the future, the three goddesses I will serve you personally, as long as you find a way to tie them firmly, this should be something I have to do, but now I can't help you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What I can do for you is to raise your title. The 'Surface Walker', this title allows you to have more divine options, and pay less divine grace, in the popular way, is a 20% discount, in addition to a suggestion, that is to pay attention to eternity With the Dragon of Time, but don't rely on it, never think that sacrifice is a harvest, on the contrary, we are paying, in contrast, the mother nest is more reliable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I should go. When you saw this letter, I was already on the way to the dark area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Come to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that you like to do stupid things, but you also know that I never lie, okay, if you must insist, then you Don't come to me until you can bring down the Pope's dynasty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, my Richard."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of this letter is the style of flowing sand, straightforward, when reading the letter, Richard is like listening to her, when the letter is put down His heart also trance, feel as if this letter is in and he opened a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you kidding? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swayed his head hard and looked at the letter carefully, only to know that he was not mistaken. He sat for a while before he walked out of the study room. Sitting on the wall of the corridor with the sea, waiting for him, the girl has now replaced a lady's safari in Noland, but her unique temperament is not the image and clothes can change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "A friend suddenly When I left, I need to confirm it immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany you." Shan and Hai said, then looked at Richard and made up. One sentence: "I will wait for you outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and left the floating island with the girl and hurried away to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal Dragon Hall, both the priest and the guard, recognizes Richard, a person who can make several top sacrifices in just one year. It’s not so easy to forget, so no matter who you meet, you are very polite to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan Grand God official came out to meet and said to Richard: "You are coming, Vatican is waiting to see you, you come with me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to Vatican’s residence, Nolan whispered to Richard: “After seeing the Vatican’s priest, you come to me again. I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and entered the temple of Vatican. The place where Vatican lived was always so simple. The succinctness made people feel uncomfortable. When she asked Richard to sit down, she asked: "I have seen the letter from the quicksand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dark area is What kind of place." Richard opened the door and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed and said, "I want to go to her so soon. It’s an anxious little guy. It seems that you are really very attentive. Flowing sand, but now... saying that it is already late, the sand should have entered the dark area. Once the place is entered, it can no longer look back. Even if she has not left, you can’t keep her. This is... Her fate is destined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of place is the dark area." Richard is sometimes very stubborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin didn’t answer immediately, but waved a pale gold sand, and the power of time turned into a beautiful world, but I saw it in A void in the sky, encrusted with countless diamond-like stars, they are a little bright, some dim, all kinds of colors, and there are always old stars dying, and new stars are born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every star you see is a world, a world of large and small planes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s hand moves, a small part of the stars dimmed, leaving only a group of stars in the center, forming a star cluster, and some of them have some bright stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stars that we can see now are the world of the eternal and timeless dragons, and the faint ones on the edge are The world has not been completely mastered by the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, but the power of time has begun to influence there, and where we can't see, there are countless stars, where they are collectively called dark regions."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, then I realized what the dark area meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to go to the dark areas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a oracle, pioneering the darkness The natural nature is her fate, just like me. Of course, we can not accept this fate. The dragon of eternal and time does not like to force, but this is the way to get the most grace. She needs grace very much recently. Many gods, only in this way can we meet her needs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s voice is empty and distant, echoing in the hall, like From the millennium, he told Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and God's grace, Vatican has not only said to Richard that the sands need to be graced, but Richard is also doing his best. Collecting sacrifices, but the sand is still going to the dark areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark area, there is no position, no coordinates, no transmission, no time channel, and Richard does not know where the sand is going, now I want to Going, there is no way to find it. The only way he can think of is to explore the dark areas after reaching the legendary realm. I hope that one day I will encounter the sand. However, as long as it is a little rational, I will understand this. What awkward hope is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does she need so much grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin reveals a faint smile and says: "Every god will need a lot of grace. Because they always encounter this kind of situation or the kind of situation that they have no choice, and they are often willing to pay a huge price for their choice, even if the price is not what they can afford."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the choice of sand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin shook his head and said, "I can't tell you this." That is, I want to say, you can't hear it, you should know that in the realm of God, some words can't be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vatican's expression, thoughtful, then changed the way to ask: "There is always a way I can know, yes, what kind of conditions are needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This time Vatican responded very simply: "When you can suppress the time rule here, I can tell you."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Temple of Eternal Dragon, suppressing the time rule of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, Richard would rather not know such conditions for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard suddenly remembered the moment he climbed the snow-capped mountains in Calando. When he looked at the snow peaks in the distance, he also felt that he did not know when he was. Only then was able to stand on the top of the snow, but in the end, he successfully won the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is far away, as long as you are willing to go, always go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I have to ask you for more guidance in the future." Richard said it was sincere and sincere, and Vatican understood the meaning of his words, so he smiled. Tao: "I don't need your god's grace, and I don't have the ability to help you. If you want more help, you can talk to Nolan and hope they are not gods. I can't control what I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also understands the meaning of Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left Vatican’s main hall, Richard saw Nolan staying outside, so he greeted him, and Nolan said hello to him, He walked to the back of the Dragon Temple, where a quiet little courtyard was built, where high-ranking priests lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
