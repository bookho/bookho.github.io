The sand was smiling, and the residual page of the book was handed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took over the page and almost couldn’t help but feel excited. He didn’t even think that he could see the second book. The single piece of the page from the Temple of Courage has been a powerful magical item in his battle, and now with two pieces of debris, you can immediately verify the legend about the special ability of the book. If the hinge can indeed generate new abilities afterwards, then according to his assessment, the book of bearing is equivalent to a quasi-artifact, and the value is incalculable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did this come from?" Richard asked solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found it in a time crack in the forward base. Maybe it was floating in the turbulent time, suddenly somehow encountered a shuttle Advancing to the base, it was swept into this plane." Flowing sand is very easy. But Richard knows that if it weren't for her, anyone who changed someone would know where the page was and could not be taken out. Time cracks are the most dangerous trap in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our luck is really good!" Richard sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand smiled and said: "I am a god, and you are also concerned about the eternal and time dragon, so our luck can not be worse Luck is also part of the strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee spreads the scraps on the table and takes out the existing pages, leaving two pages Put it together. Not waiting for him to carefully study the method of convergence, as soon as the two pieces of debris are close, they all begin to shine with unclear attributes, and they are close together and superimposed. The closer they are to the brilliance, the more shiny they are. When they finally touch each other, Richard’s eyes illuminate a dazzling glare, and he can't help but close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes again, the two pages in front of him had turned into a thin book with a defect on the cover. The pattern can only faintly distinguish the lines resembling vortices, and completely do not understand what it means. After flipping the cover, you can see that there are only two thick pages between the upper and lower covers, the color is slightly yellow, much like a little blank parchment, but the texture is more flexible and firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the page, Richard slowly enters the magic, try to send out a normal detection magic, the use of the book and the new features will appear In his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two pieces of residual pages are combined, an additional magic can be stored, and the upper limit of the magic level is also six. That is to say, this book of bearers in the hands of Richard can now store a total of three levels of magic! At least in the battle of the immediate level, three six-level magic is enough to reverse the situation, and the Richard side is equivalent to a half-fourth-level grand magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mensa family’s forward base has a large amount of material reserves, which are undoubtedly valuable, but Richard can’t enjoy it. Just like the forward base of the Archimonde family, this base, which has been exposed to the eyes of the temple and the local lords, is simply unusable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before the Xerxes Temple, where the resident soldiers did not make daily rewards, will re-explore the area. There are not dozens of town bear knights under Richard, although the overall strength of the team has once again increased, but it will not be arrogant to the point of trying to deal with a complete battle gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard collected all the magic materials and replaced them with all the equipment stored in the base. It is a pity that the savage body is too big and there is no armor suitable for them, so some simple measures are taken, covering each deck with a deck on the back of their chest, and then twisting them together with a special peg. After re-equipping, Richard himself estimated that the combat effectiveness of the entire unit would have increased by at least 15%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another accident is that all the captured warriors joined the Richard team. Kas used a similar approach to sands on them, coercing the soldiers to pray in a seven-day ritual, but the content was not a belief in God, but a curse, and a statue of Xerxes at a fixed time. Stolen. For seven consecutive days of curses, these soldiers were covered with a layer of black gas that was not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is the name of these soldiers today. The black gas on them can be seen by the clergy of Xerxes and by the powerful legal staff. Therefore, as long as the soldiers belonging to the temple are willing to go back, they will be tied to the firearm and burned to death. This is a punishment. If someone voluntarily repents of the temple and confesses what happened, he will be sent to the firearm to burn, which is called redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerxes is a powerful god, not to be guilty of faith, and regret can not offset the original sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Cass's 'contribution', all that Richard can do is shake his head. The order was made by him, and the fallen priest also completed the task perfectly, and tied everyone to the chariot of Richard, except for the two Knights of the Temple. Their beliefs are much more determined than the pastor of Kas. When they wake up, they are constantly struggling to resist, and they must look at all opportunities to die with the gods. In the end, Richard had to order the execution of two Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking away everything that can be taken away, Richard led the team to leave the Mensa base to the Sequoia Kingdom, it was time to finish and the Duke of the wolf Trading. At the same time, Richard is also ready to look at the opportunity to lead the bear bears of the bears to the south of the bloody land, where they are. A deadly battle. The town bear knights are too special, from various signs they simply failed to integrate or hide the order of the plane. Therefore, the process of crossing the blood-stained land is a process of fierce battle with all parties and the weakening of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has the identity of pioneering the Cavaliers as a cover, but does not mind using the power of this plane to easily remove the town bears. He is very aware of the value of the town bear knight, and every kill is a heavy blow to the Schumpeter family. Li is not afraid that they will not go to the south of the blood-stained land, because they will be active in the South when they arrive, such a big bait, they don’t want to be hooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, deep inside Richard, there is always no sense in the struggle with the Schumpeter family. But the reality is that he is not allowed to choose, only passive acceptance. It seems that since the moment I returned to the family, there have always been people who have come to the door, and they are constantly coming. Even when he ran to an unfamiliar plane to open up the territory, some people chased it from Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Richard is helpless, there is also a anger in his chest burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silent team walked east and south along the eastern edge of the blood-stained land and gradually went to the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, Liusha finally digested most of the time from the base and successfully advanced to the tenth-level gods. Although the tenth level only allowed her to cast more fifth-order magic, her title was promoted to the second order. The title of ‘breaking dawn’ is the ability of the sand to break and borrow other gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
