			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a weathered stone forest, Richard is sitting in the shadow of the pinnacle Close your eyes and raise your spirits. The magic in his body is recovering bit by bit, but now he only recovers half. The other two wizards, Tiramisu and Sandro, have only one-third of the magic. What is even more worrying is that there is only one third of the power of sand. Her scrolls of magic have been consumed more than half, leaving less than thirty in their hands, many of which take time to rewrite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even the sand people who have always been known for their durability have shown extreme exhaustion. Many soldiers immediately fell to the ground and stopped to sleep. Many of the powerful barbarians have injuries on their bodies. These flesh wounds are no longer considered in the sands, and only half of the Orc warriors remain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of wind teeth is only nine. The creation of these mother nests has played far more than the seven levels of combat in their own area because they can accept the orders of Richard. Powerful dozens of times. They are the key gears on the entire alchemy machine. Without them, Richard can't transport hundreds of people to be as flexible as their own arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the combat effectiveness of the troops can be said to have fallen to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last encounter, Richard ordered all contractors to use all the explosive skills as soon as they started the battle. The results were quite impressive. In the concentrated area, more than 100 bodies were left in an instant, and the team of more than 500 people was suddenly devastated by a formation and did not organize a decent counterattack. Directly scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is the result of Richard’s active choice. After a long tug of war, he can vaguely calculate the approximate orientation of several alternate old faces. After sending out the fangs for directional detection, he decisively directed the entire team to the east, directly to the team of horses that would have appeared on the battlefield after two rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of proactive attack is enormous, because according to the Red Cossack tactics, another force that has been trimmed is preparing for the next attack. Once the anticipated blitzkrieg turns into a stalemate, Richard will face a dangerous situation that is pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, fortunately, the development of the war is tilting toward Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contractors’ unreserved concentrated attacks have achieved better results than expected. Richard’s team temporarily opened all the tracks and successfully turned. Although the combat power fell into the lowest point at this time, Richard believes that the enemy is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently calculated the time, opened his eyes a few minutes in advance, and stood up on the stone wall. Now he only feels stiff all over the body. There are a total of six unhealed wounds on the shoulders and back. It is still aching pain. The magic robe has long been unable to see the original color, and the pieces are as hard as leather. Sweat and blood are mixed with the red clay dust that is unique to the blood-stained area. This is the case after repeated soaking and drying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of Richard is all awkward. He squats twice and spits out a lot of gravel. The horse's blood in the stomach is still rolling, it is a kind of burning pain, and I want to dump the contents inside at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sorted out the grassy hair, took a deep breath, and began to feel the vitality of the body is adding to it bit by bit. Physical strength and magic. He rubbed his eyes again, grinned, made himself look a little more beautiful, and then went to the warriors who were screaming, and screamed: "Get up! Prepare to fight! Let us give those behind the ass Rabbit scorpions will come again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of Richard, most of the soldiers rolled over and climbed up, grabbed their weapons, and prepared for the battle. The fighting in the past few days has enabled Richard to win the status of God in the minds of these soldiers, and almost all orders to him are instinctively obeyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only half an hour of rest is not enough, but the soldiers climbed up as fast as they could, rushing to their respective team leaders. A few of them are too tired to sleep, and in the past they kicked a few feet, and they even climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the entire army was concealed in the stone forest. Almost just hid, the horizon was raised in the distance, and a stable riding team followed the traces left by Richard. The time they appeared was less than five minutes before Richard expected. Richard is secretly satisfied. After feeling that the talent of wisdom has evolved to the second stage, he has more precise grasp of the surrounding areas of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is just just bright, in the dim light, the team can still track accurately, obviously the leader is a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of this team is not much, only two hundred rides. Such a person will dare to chase, naturally not an ordinary horse. Although looking at the other party's flag and clothing is unfamiliar, it seems to be a new team, but Richard can clearly feel the emotional fluctuations of some of the sand people and barbarian warriors around him, it is a mixture of fearful strong hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there are counts in Richard’s mind. This is a cavalry with a slave group. A set of corresponding complete strategies was immediately planned in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching Shilin, the headed knight suddenly stopped the war horse! Years of battle gave him a keen instinct, and he felt an extremely dangerous heart from the stone forest in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he stopped the horse, a sharp arrow broke the darkness silently, when the chest came! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrow is extremely sinister, the Cavaliers leader has no time to do other coping, immediately a horse, the horseman rises up, with his body as the main block I got this arrow. However, Yu Guangzhong, the leader of the knight’s eyes, suddenly saw a white girl floating from her side. He immediately glanced at it and couldn't understand why this scene appeared in front of him. When he looked up again, the girl had disappeared. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers suddenly felt a coolness behind them, instantly spreading throughout the body, and the power inside the body was completely exhausted. He was black in front of him and fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the Cavaliers’ leader was killed, Richard immediately gave a series of orders, so the wind rushed out of Shilin with a team of fighters. on. Before the two teams collided together, Richard’s group was slow and Sandru’s fear of strengthening fell into the team, causing at least 30 knights to get into chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with the Master!" Someone in the Cavaliers shouted, and someone was calling the Master of the party, but the Master had just begun to cast spells and was suddenly seen. The water splashes. The four Master Guards placed in advance are completely ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams clashed fiercely together, and the chaotic battle was like a game in Richard’s eyes, and each piece was under his control. And through the movement of the square pieces, he can even manipulate the direction of the opponent's pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is as short and fierce as ever. Although the individual squad is dominant, it suddenly encounters a surprise attack and is killed by the leader during the war. The defeat was exceptionally rapid, and after a few moments, half of the body was dropped and the emperor fled. And Richard can't avoid damage, and there are ten people who sleep in this land. It took only ten minutes to clean up the battlefield, and Richard led the team to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
