			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard appeared on the floating island, Ellie had arrived one day earlier Richard placed the place where he met Ellie in the Archimonde's family cemetery, which is one of Archimonde's most important ways to meet each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice appeared quite emotional when she embarked on a volcano that might erupt at that moment. She walked, looked and read the names on the tombstones. With the story of life, every one has not been missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard looked extremely patient, followed by Ellie, and with her to see the epitaph, there is no urging, Richard has entered more than once Family cemetery, it can be said that every inch of the place here has been engraved in the heart of Richard, but every time you read the words on the tombstones, it seems to see the life of Akmend's bloody battle for generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bizarre family and a family full of contradictions and chaos. Each of them has tried every means to break the tradition while being deeply infatuated. With it, no matter how long the powerful blood is mixed into the name of Archimonde in the long years, the most powerful ones still choose the blazing volcanic atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, two people came to the top of the volcano, and all the real Archimondees are yearning for it. Here, every tombstone is only recorded. The true name of the masters, compared with the real name, the experience and glory of life is no longer important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice stroking a tombstone, his face unexpectedly revealing a trace of sentimentality, so Richard’s surprise was when her finger crossed the section When the real name was quite long, one of the short paragraphs flashed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard is truly surprised: "You also awakened your real name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellie did not say back: "Yes, in fact, this is nothing to be surprised. Every Archimonde should have the potential to awaken his real name, but only the real madman will get hidden in the blood. Strength, have your own blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at Ellie and said, "You seem to be particularly interested in this tombstone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Ellie’s voice became soft and complicated, saying: "He was the ancestor of my pulse more than three hundred years ago. Strictly speaking, my blood is passed down to him, he is a demon. The wise man in the chaos is also the orderer in chaos. Because of this, it is not tolerated by many of Archimonde who is in chaos. If it is not because of his power, not because he has the real name recognized by the blood, then he does not It may have a position in the family cemetery, but his existence is not tolerated by many people. The enemy not only comes from outside the family, but also from the inside of the family. In the end of the year, he went straight, and it was supposed to be a perfect raid. But the accident was ambushed for the enemy of absolute superiority. Eventually the whole army was annihilated, and the one who sold him was my great-grandmother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stunned, this again It is a secret that will eventually be buried in history. After Ellie, I don’t know who will remember him, the wise man in the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your real name is." When the words were exported, Richard regretted it. The real name is the biggest secret of every Archimonde, and asked Ellie. The real name means that everything in her future will be under her control. How is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s reaction was not as big as Richard’s expectation, she just sighed and said, “Richard, it’s not the time, wait. The time is ripe, I will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpected answer for Richard, more unexpected than direct rejection or even pain, Richard Thinking about it, revealing a cautious expression, asking: "When is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice closed her eyes, the young female god of war showed A thick, tired color, said: "When I feel tired completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am waiting for you." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who can be completely trusted, such as Alice, is invaluable. So far, Richard has no shortage of strong people, and he is only able to defend one side alone. The generals, Gangde is one, but it is only barely qualified. The big men are quite old, but they are not the ones who can create miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked up and looked at Richard and said, "Lee, tell me about your business, and give me some confidence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the confidence to choose my partner." Li smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all, but it's almost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugs and asks: "Is not enough achievements now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked at Richard and showed a smile and said, "Is it really not enough for the 17th-level wizard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still a royal master." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice shook her head and said, "I know, but it's not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Licha was a little surprised. He said: "Life is a must for self. I can also tailor a second-order suit for people. Don't confuse me with Lunuo's waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sighed again, raised her face and looked at Richard, saying: "Richard, I am really hesitant and a little scared, so I hope that you can Give me more confidence, more reasons, let me take that step, and it is not the people like Luno, but... your father, I remember the first time I came to the family. The scene of the cemetery, for every Archimonde, it is a holy place, but... But I saw that he actually sat on the top of a tombstone, very casual, very natural, as if he was born I should sit there, I was still very small at that time, but I couldn’t forget that scene.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Richard glimpsed, also recalling the scene when Gordon took his first time to enter the family cemetery, but his thoughts at the time were different from those of Alice. At that time, Little Richard only wanted to kick Gotton. Into the volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is compared with Gordon, Richard can't help but straighten up his body, and the mood can't be explained at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sorted out the idea and said: "I have a great grasp on the structure of the sacred sects. As for magic, can you become a legendary mage? I don't know, but at least the big magician is no problem. I now control the two planes. In total, the total income will be stable at more than 10 million per year. The ability in war is not good, but at least you have seen it. The Raymond kid is completely annihilated under my hand, although there are factors that he has bad luck here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds great, but be careful He was assassinated." Ellie sipped her face and poured a cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she still doesn't know that Richard has already gone to the absolute battlefield, and he has successfully walked to the sun-drenched capital. In the past, there were numerous saints, which were the first time to set foot on the battlefield and rush to the legion. On the road to the fortress, Richard, who can survive on the battlefield, is not so easy to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Richard’s experience, Ellie finally nodded and said, “Enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha also breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile: "In fact, I think my most important trait is that I already have a strong heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Alice also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are still many secrets in Richard, such as the mother's nest, such as his two talents, but he and Ellie are actually negotiating a covenant. At the stage, naturally, all the cards are not exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So now, what is your decision." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice has regained her usual calmness and decisiveness, saying: "Allied, companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Companion, this is not necessary." Richard frowned, and he now has a headache for the ancient tradition of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always have to fulfill my obligations. I don't want the other party to influence the covenant between us. In addition, if there is such a relationship between men and women. It feels different, so it’s not difficult for me, as long as I don’t hate you, it’s enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice said indifferently But the body is a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha thinks for a moment, he really does not want to push Alice into the arms of others, once there is a child, it is difficult to cut the bond So he nodded: "Well, just set it, when will the signing of the covenant and the partner's ... ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice squats forward Put your hand on Richard’s heart and say, “The covenant between us is only here. It is not necessary to write on paper that is totally unreliable. If both parties are interested, then the covenant will last forever. Partner, I don't want to choose another time and place, just here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
