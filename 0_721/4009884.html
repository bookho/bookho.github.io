			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar is not a city center, but it is not remote and quite large. From the time of the killing in the bar, there have been a lot of time until now, although it is very hasty, but it is enough for some forces to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the bar, Richard took a deep breath of cool nights and licked his clothes, instead of rushing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grocery store next door is still open, and the old man at the store is sitting on a bench half of the store in the store, on the bench outside the store, mysteriously to Richard. Smiled and said: "The young man is really impulsive. When he first went to the Blue Water Oasis, he killed so many people, and he will definitely not give up with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, Richard’s men had already left the bar, but Richard did not mean to leave, but smiled at the old man and said, “This is not my impulse. I don’t like being black money, I don’t like being black money. I still have to leave my hands and feet. This is not too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too big, at least here," said the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, then I will make the enemy bigger," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed and said: "Young people are always very confident. But they like to get into trouble but not a good character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has taken out a white handkerchief and started cleaning his hands. Just in the melee, his hands were indeed contaminated with a few drops of wine. When he heard the old man, he just smiled deeply and replied: "I really don't like trouble, but if anyone comes to me because of this, he will find himself very troublesome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head and said, "You are an outsider after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blue water oasis has a large lake. What Stick has is only a small cup. And outsiders are not necessarily bullied. Since living in this land, it is necessary to have a pair of eyes that are not so powerful." Said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you have already killed the Stricks in the bar, why not leave?" the old man asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled mysteriously and said, "Let's wait for someone to send us a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, there is a faint hoof in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooves are getting closer and closer, and a group of knights rush out from the corner of the 100-meter street and fly towards the bar. This team of knights has more than a dozen people, the momentum is like the wind, but the control skills are very bright, after the night is still very lively on the street, the horse is running, there is no collision, no one, it seems that in addition to riding In addition, it is also very restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of power in the blue water oasis, except for the slave traders, no one is the only one. The slave traders are divided into four big business groups. Presumably, because of this, these knights are cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short distance they rushed over, Richard had already seen that the Cavaliers headed for the 12th level, followed by only seven or eight cavalry. . It seems that this should be a captain of Sticker, because he was close, and the first time after receiving the news of the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard took the handkerchief and put it away, and did not forget to say to the old man: "Our Malay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still tens of meters away, headed The knight saw a group of Richards, kicking the horse's belly and speeding up. On the one hand, this group of people in Li is really too eye-catching. In the bloody land where the slave trade is rampant, a purebred elf in a free state is very dazzling. Under the dark night, there is no difference between a bloody half-elf like Oral and an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Cavaliers yelled far away: "Who is in the bar of our two-headed dragon?" Six or seven seemingly idle people raised their fingers at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers no longer hesitate, but accelerated the rush to the horse and rushed to Richard and others. For the first captain, the hammer was picked up, and the steel hammer with the thorns was full of screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has begun to recite the spell, but watching the speed of the knights sprint, only left him two seconds of casting time. Then, when the team rushed into the distance of 20 meters, the water flower suddenly stepped forward, and the faint light flashed in the eyes, and the short hair fluttered, and suddenly a screaming scream was heard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few horses were suddenly frightened, and they stood up and flew out the knights on their backs. Then they went crazy and turned left and right, and kicked and bite. Hu Chong ran into a collision, just wanted to find a way to escape, the farther away from the girl, the better. In these horse consciousness, not far from the cute girl is standing, but a powerful demon wolf that can tear them into pieces at any time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first horse of the knight is the same person, but his martial arts is obviously higher than his hand, and his legs are clipped, but he has not been taken out immediately. However, the sudden loss of the center of gravity, the hammer of the rapid spin can no longer be controlled, bang into a building next to it, plowing a deep ditch on the wall. However, although he barely controlled the horse, but the cavalry behind him was still sprinting all the time, where the momentum was received, so they ran into the mad horses in front of them, and it was a while. The captain was finally spared. The horse was knocked twice. His equestrian was no better, and he couldn't control the mount that was swept by his companions' fear waves. He finally fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the chaos of the scene, Richard’s magic was finally completed, and it was a group delay, which covered most of the knights. There are three more people in the magic range who are referring to the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde, Shuihua and two stepping knights have all rushed out, but the three arrows crossed them and shot three cavalry. The captain struggled to sit up from the ground, and one of his legs was still pressed under the turned horse. Suddenly he saw Gangde striding forward, and the giant axe in his hand crossed with a fierce evil! The captain yelled, and had no time to dodge. He had to erect a hammer and tried to block the axe with a chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s face flashed a layer of suffocating, and the body suddenly burst into a pale yellow light, and the magical structure under the robes was lit at the same time. Under the dual effects of the power outburst and the power of the earth, the strong wind on the giant axe suddenly sharpened, like a sudden rainstorm, and the old man who was still sitting at the door of the grocery store opened his eyes. Suddenly looked at Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant axe cuts the chain with unmatched power, then breaks the knight's armor and finally cuts it from the neckline! The captain's head flew high, but the body was actually sitting and refused to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Cavaliers was killed on the spot, and the remaining cavalry still in chaos was no longer the opponent of these fierce gods, and was simply killed and killed. There are about seventeen or eight horses that can ride in more than twenty horses, enough for each of Richard and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
