On the ground, hands naturally hang down on the side. Because it was on his own site, Richard only carried a knife with him, and the rest of the weapons were left in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time he seems to be unarmed, but Mito suddenly feels more dangerous than before, even stronger than the dangerous feeling brought by Naiyou Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician’s mind turned a lot of thoughts in an instant, and finally only spread his hands, and did not move the magic, took two steps to the side, and sat down safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou's dark gray eyes greet Richard's gaze, where the gray rotation is uncertain, and there are deep vortexes. It seems that there is an invisible suction, and the soul that has been pulled by Richard is turbulent and almost has to be taken out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was shocked, and then the momentum surged, and a powerful killer emerged, slamming into the center of the vortex! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whirl in the courtyard, and Li’s body snorted and his body just shook. Naiyou then retired five or six steps, until the back hit the wall, only to stop the body. Her eyes have returned from dark gray to black and white, and the two red blood lines hang down from the corner of the eye. Under the black and white background, it is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou had a slight surprise on her face with no expression. She stabilized her body and bowed to Richard for a courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted, reached for the extinction, re-hung back to his waist, and then said to Nye: "You are new, this time. Even then, you can do it yourself. I can forgive the mistakes, but I will never tolerate betrayal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard left the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naiyou wiped the blood line on his face with his sleeves and left the small courtyard. However, her heart is not as calm as the surface. Just now, the two sides fight with a piece of soul power. As a soul shepherd, she feels like she is heading into a mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Naiyou have left, and there is only Mito in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician sits there and feels that the magic in the body is recovering quickly. He is now able to cast seven levels of magic, and there is enough magic to fly away. Escape from this place. Although he used the magic slavery reel, but for a price, for example, the magic will permanently drop more than one level, you can forcibly get rid of the constraints of contract power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the mind is moving, it is freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mito was still sitting and not moving, a small mouthful of sipping a cold coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is Faro, his identity is an intruder, is he running away and where can he go? If you force the impact of the portal, go back to Noland, not to mention the bunch of followers, he will probably beat more than one Lina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you return to Noland? He is very aware of the situation of the Joseph family. This time the expeditionary army was completely annihilated, and it was a heavy blow to the Joseph family and their old allies. Joseph may not be cleared out of the floating island, but he will only be able to protect himself in the next few years. With a deep foundation and the staff headquarters left by Raymond, the situation may be better than the Schumpeter family, but only a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he has no choice at all. The Mito and Joseph families are essentially employment relations, but because he was with him from Raymond when he was a child, it took so long to have feelings. Therefore, he can fight to save Raymond on the battlefield, but it is still far from the point of killing Joseph's surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in Noland, Richard is a big architect, the magic of the 16th level, and will never be afraid of a big magician in the district. Even if he returned to Noland, he still had to face the infinite pursuit of Richard. He is old, and Richard is still less than twenty years old. How long can he escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito sighed deeply and sat quietly. He is tired and does not want to go to the day of the day. Moreover, the conditions given by Richard are quite generous. Although Archimonde is very poor, the skill of his great magister is not particularly lacking in gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, returning to Faro's drifting sand in advance is resting on the lounge chair, carefully combing the long hair that has grown a lot longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of her, the fighting priest Io is like a fierce lion walking back and forth in the room, unable to sit quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sandsand...Adults!" It was difficult for Iowa to control his emotions. After the name of the sands, he added the honor of the adults. "You promised." If I have the grace, I will raise my level bottleneck. Now I have been stuck on the 16th level for a long time, but you...you have created a guardian of the day!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands are not lifted, and faintly said: "Have I promised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! You! "Israel's handsome face swelled red, so angry that he couldn't speak." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly speaking, the quicksand did not promise him, at most it was only acquiescence. However, the United States and Russia fought fiercely in Faro, and almost all of them were thrown into Faro. Isn’t it a breakthrough limit? If it weren't for him, it would be possible for the big man of Gangde to maintain the situation of Faro so well when Richard was absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Iowa also admitted that the big man is not nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde has the political acumen and commanding wisdom that the appearance is completely invisible, and there is also a kind of bravery that Iowa also moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some miraculous battles, if I changed to Iraq, they simply couldn’t get out. For example, when Surinwell was surrounded by the war, the situation was not as easy as that of Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Gangde was like a killing machine that didn't know the pain and tiredness, and shocked the central army of Salenwell like crazy! The thick battle of the elite soldiers of the Iron Triangle Empire was actually really pierced by Gangde! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were at least four or five ranks besides the generals of Gangde, but when Gangde was like a blood giant When they were killed, everyone was timid, and no one dared to come up to fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the retreat of Salenville, the original defeated battlefield miraculously reversed. After the war, when Iraq and Russia were wounded by Gangde, almost no count of how many wounds were in this strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Gangde, who had just healed the wound under the effect of magic, drove Iowa to drink and drunk the fighting officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, they have truly become comrades-in-arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian now has some unwillingness to admit it, even if the sand does not give him a promotion level, continue to press him in Faro, he will probably complain a few words, Do the same thing as you do. The reason is not for Richard’s hegemony, but for not being able to support the situation alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current 16th-level strength, in the battle, you can scale up the strength of hundreds of elite knights, if you concentrate on supporting a small team, then It is possible to increase the strength of the Cavaliers under the fifteenth level by two levels. This is enough to reverse the power of the local battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the roar, the anger of Iowa subsided slightly, saying to the flowing sand: "Well, I am a big man, I respect your decision. But! But... you are free Just make a guardian of the heavens, how can I get her out?! She..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to me?" The sound of plain water, the result of the Iraqi Russian body is a trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyu entered the room, closed the door, and then turned to the left, black and white, and looked at Io. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle god official snorted and his eyes glowed with two brilliant lights. The black and white two-tone light and the golden brilliance seemed to collide in the void, and this was separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioly said with dignity: "Neiyou, I am not afraid of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou Suddenly chuckle, said: "I will not be afraid of you. In addition, I will not be as chaotic as you, I have heard of your glorious deeds, being beaten by a magician, and it is really good!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s face suddenly changed, and roared, saying: “You can also try it and see what the consequences are!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand stopped the action of combing long hair, looked up and looked at the two of them and said, "How many secrets do you have in both, say it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s face changed, and before he spoke, Naiyou had already said first: “We are all from the same place. I can only tell you, that The place is also a sequence of divine powers of eternal and timeless dragons. Besides, there is no impression of forming everything in our memory, nor can it be leaked in any way. If you want to know more, then You can ask the Eternal and Time Dragons by offering sacrifices or consuming gods. Maybe you can get the answer. This is the only way I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The flowing sand nodded, then looked at Naiyou and said, "You are not going to carry something with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been with Richard Adults have once compared the power of the soul." Nai You said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the result?" The sand-sanding eyebrows wrinkled, and Iowa showed a clear expression of gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am seriously injured, he is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant finally couldn’t help but laugh, After coming to this world, he smiled so open for the first time. Obviously, compared with Richard, Naiyou even hated him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand gaze became sharper, sweeping through the two guards of the day, and asked: "Do you still want to do something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
