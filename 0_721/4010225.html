			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina is a former rush, the whole person is wrapped around the son of the forest, double The arm clasped him firmly. Then a magical light flashed, and Lina and the Son of the Forest appeared in the sky above, just in front of Red Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carol, Dragon Breath!" Lina shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon car flashed in his eyes, hesitated, the mouth open, the burning dragon lingered in the throat, but did not spray it out. This dragon will be covered in the past, and the Master of the Dragon will be covered with the Son of the Forest. Red Dragon Carlo and Dragon Master Lina concluded a partnership contract, so the Dragon Master can summon it out if it is not legendary. The relationship between a dragon and a person is actually a friend, not a relationship between a contract creature and a summoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carol!!" Lina's voice is near hysteria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of the Forest struggled frantically, hitting her fragile body, even biting on Lina’s arm and tearing off a piece of flesh! Then it is a bite down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol’s earth-shattering dragon scorpion, followed by a thick dragon spurt, wrapped both Lina and the son of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to have solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the two figures in the air fell and fell in the forest. The Master of the Dragon was already silent, and the son of the forest jumped up. He grabbed an elf Druid and stabbed the handcuff into the heart of Druid. In an instant, he took all the vitality of Druid. Natural mana, his face has also become ruddy. He turned back and glanced at the opponents in disgust, and was ready to flee to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a faint voice sounded: "Do you think you can still escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still damn calm, and the voice is damn indifferent. However, he actually stood still, and he did not know how many wounds he had. Even the shirts became awkward. The blood rushed from every place, and accumulated a thick shoal under the feet. Only with a long knife, Richard could stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of the Forest suddenly felt that Richard’s light on the elf's long knife was a bit dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, all the natural forces and essence of life in the forest son are boiling, completely out of his control, and then centered on a certain point of the body. Crazy gathering in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of the Forest suddenly thought of a legend about the horror of the invaders in the family, bursting with a scream of horror: "Elemental extraction?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know?" Richard said sarcastically, reaching for the blade of the nameless knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of the forest screams fiercely, tumbling desperately on the ground, can see that his body is rapidly shrinking and drying, and in a blink of an eye it becomes a dry corpse . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of the forest used his last strength and turned over and never moved. A deep red blood crystal rolled from his mouth and rolled out on the grass, and he stopped unwillingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief, could no longer support it, and fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a constant whistling in the forest. The surviving elves and the Druids have no fighting spirit and retreat to the depths of the jungle. The number of withdrawals is only a quarter of the ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up to the sky and his view was full of pale green sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels that the body is now very light and light, and that consciousness and thoughts are floating, as if they are separated from the body. The wind in the forest is a bit cold, so he wants to wrap himself, but can't find anything to cover himself. Richard felt that his body was very empty, as if something had been flowing outwards, and he was a little flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard’s consciousness flashed through countless pictures, and many memories that were thought to have been forgotten passed through the mind. Suddenly, in the first decade of childhood, if the light and the flying power flashed, all the memories were so fresh and profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, what kind of person is Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, is a real The man is a hero and a bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why doesn't he live with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a secret!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When my little Richard becomes a real man, my mother will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I be a real man?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to defeat your father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will definitely!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there seems to be a ray of light in front of Li, which is the brilliance of magic. Then the erratic consciousness was pulled back to the body, and Richard even felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the scene in front of him was clear again, Richard saw a familiar face of the official. That is the family priest brought by Agamemnon. The priest seems to be trying to cast a spell, his face is tired and sweaty, and his old face is wrinkled like a chrysanthemum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the left and saw that Agamemnon had the same painful expression. Looking to the right again, Nyris is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two, just now he/mother/all are crazy? Desperately fun?" Richard groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to your uncle!" This is the words of Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you better than us?" Nyris is also sober. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dry!" In addition to swearing, Richard has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer cares about the two madmen, but screams at the people in the field of vision: "Help me get up and go see the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Richard, which goddess officer?" The royal guard stared by Richard looked cold and sweaty and asked very carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said impatiently: "There is one that is the most beautiful face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp So the clever, promising royal guards put Richard in front of the sand. The sacred man closed his eyes and his breath was weak, but he still did not forget to compare him to a sly middle finger! It was just the corner of her lips that she couldn’t help but smile, and she was very satisfied with Richard’s evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "Take me to see the female magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Which female magician?" The Royal Guard asked, his future is brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nonsense, the biggest one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard was taken to the Dragon Master . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still alive?" Richard asked, but there was a trembling in his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, I have a wish, how can I die!" Lina angered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was carried, walked a full circle, returned to the original place, and was placed on the grass. The grass is still very soft, it is damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but looking to the left, lying Agamemnon, looking to the right, it is the four emperors, Richard feels flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed, and after a moment, Nyris laughed, and then Agamemnon. Three different styles of laughter are intertwined and echoed in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to clean up the battlefield. The Richards killed more than one hundred and thirty people, and almost everyone was wounded. Fifteen construction knights were folded three more. The elf dropped nearly a thousand bodies, 11 Druids, more than 130 war trees, and one son of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest result is the blood of the Son of the Forest and the singular blade of the spear, which is a weapon that is likely to reach the legendary level. However, whether or not the Greenson plane can retain its special effects still requires further identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the life tree of migration, it must have gone far and is unable to track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one day, Richard’s troops set off for the return to the base city. In addition to the blood crystal, the most important thing in the harvest is the heart of a dozen people. But on the way home, the entire team was silent and quietly walked through the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers cut down trees and made a large number of covered stretchers, carrying the wounded who could not walk. Richard, Nyris and Agamemnon each occupied a stretcher. When they looked at each other, their expressions were helpless and emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon’s intestines were broken, and the Nyris ribs were barely intact, and when they were struggling to pull the ankles of the forest, they were also The kick kicked off the arm. As for Richard, it’s just that the magic has dropped back to the thirteenth level. It has been used twice in succession. It’s really strange if you don’t downgrade. Fortunately, there are no other sequelae. It’s too much to magical. Damaged magicians are not uncommon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
