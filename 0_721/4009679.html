			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to the lab and inserted the metal badge into the alchemy station, followed by There was a clear magical image that recorded the income and expenditure of Richard this month. The Alchemist has magical crystals to power, and the inspirational badge requires 5 magic points. Richard now uses all the magic to practice magic, and is not willing to waste on inspiring the badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the first line of the bill, Richard was stunned. That line is written, updating one of the magic 傀儡 dolls, counting 1600 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical monk is the steel figure that Richard used to practice fireball and other magic. As he passed the magic test site, Richard had seen the replacement of a new doll. But for such a thing, you need 1600 gold coins? Richard didn't have much idea about money, but he also knew that his mother had lived in Rutherland for ten years, and all the savings together had only a dozen gold coins. A large World of Warcraft fur is only one or two gold coins in the city. To hunt them, you need adult hunters to take risks with their lives. Perhaps the wealthiest village chiefs will have hundreds of gold coins, many of which are the army and bounty that the village chief accumulated during the army’s account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I shot two fireballs, I blasted 1600 gold coins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to recall all the details about the steel doll, and then found that the doll is almost exactly the same as the standard half-length plate, as if There is nothing else outstanding. Little Richard has no concept yet, and accuracy is the root cause of the iron man's price. The defensive power of ordinary magical dolls and military standard half-length plates is one or two levels of energy, while the dark blue steel doll error is one-tenth of the energy level. An order of magnitude difference in error, the cost is nearly 30 times the gap. The energy level is also a concept in magic, roughly referring to the energy carried by a standard level magic magic missile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat ran down from Richard’s forehead, and the huge numbers forced him to barely breathe. Rutherland Village is also the territory of the Holy Alliance, and the currency and the dark blue are connected. The 1600 gold coin is a debt that can't be afforded for a lifetime. He does not like debts. This is a character inherited from Elani. The goddess of the moon is not willing to owe anything else. The tremendous psychological pressure made Richard's eyes black, and finally calmed down and slowly looked down. Sure enough, as he thought, the price of the following items was surprisingly high. For example, the unit price of the magic recovery agent is close to 500 gold coins. Seeing this, when Richard thinks about the bottle of magic potion in the pharmacy in the warehouse area, the feeling is completely different. Those medicines are labeled, labeled for performance and usage, and are mostly auxiliary agents for improving magic perception, affinity and recovery. Mainly used by magicians to speed up the process of cultivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more than a month before coming to Deep Blue, Richard had a preliminary understanding of the world outside the mountains. At the time in Yashan, he was shocked by the expensive price of the goods, but compared with the deep blue, things in Yashan are as simple as cheap money. Just like a bottle of magical recovery, it is only 10 gold coins in Ashan, but it is 500 gold coins on the dark blue bill, a difference of 50 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Xiao Li did not know is that the magic recovery agent sold on the Yashan market lasted only three hours, and the recovery acceleration effect was only 0.5. Times. The bottle he drank lasted for 24 hours and the acceleration was doubled. Similarly, the result of a 16-fold increase in overall performance is a 50-fold increase in price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the promotion of grades, to the refining of pharmaceutical agents, and even to all walks of life, it is more difficult to progress later, and the cost of each advancement is The higher the height. Therefore, the pyramid structure is almost a common structure in all fields, and the concept that Little Richard has just learned explains the truth from another angle, and the margin is diminishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the first page, Richard saw his total spending this month: a total of 18,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every two pages are income, and Richard only saw one line above. The name is tuition subsidy and the amount is 30,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at the expenses, Richard has gradually become accustomed to the big numbers... but he is still shocked by the large number of subsidies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t say 30,000 gold coins, just one day before, 30 gold coins are the huge money that Little Richard has never seen before, and I don’t know how to spend it. Life in the mountains is self-sufficient. In addition to the need to buy out the fabric, Richard can't even think of anything else that needs to be spent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but 30000 gold coins... "Can fill this lab!" Richard, who has not recovered from the dizzy state, looked at the huge alchemy lab. I can't help thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when Richard’s eyes swept across the corners of the experiment, he got an accurate answer, and if you’re completely using Imperial gold coins, then this lab 333,300 gold coins can be laid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard shook his head hard and expelled these troublesome figures from his mind. There is no difference between 30,000 or 300,000. Anyway, it is unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the subsidy for 30,000 gold coins is only the beginning, there are a few blank columns on the second page, only the name of the big class, and no income. It seems that they will be the source of income in the future. Only the last column makes Richard somewhat difficult to understand, ‘Su Hailun’s joy’, what type of income is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calming down, Little Richard immediately discovered that there were not many subsidies for 30,000 gold coins. There are countless places to spend money in the dark blue. This is only the first month. He spends most of his time in class. It takes less than a week to actually start the magic practice. The materials and materials consumed are even less pitiful, but the expenditure has already been It reached 18,000 gold. What is certain is that he will be able to maintain a balance of payments in the next month. In a month, 30,000 gold coins are definitely not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think much more. Now that he still doesn’t have much concept about money, he already knows at least that every day of studying in Deep Blue means a lot of resources. Consumption. Although there is a subsidy of 30,000 gold coins, Richard does not think that this is no price. Being able to enter the deep blue, able to learn under the seat of the legendary mage, on the surface it must be that the Marquis of Gordon used a lot of resources, but the deeper reason is that Elaine exchanged her chance for Richard’s life. . The history and political structure of the mainland is also an important course for the Master to learn, so Richard has a preliminary understanding of the world of Noland. At least he knows the location of the legendary Master's pro-passenger students, but the empire's countless big men are dreaming of getting something. The power and status of the Marquis of Gordon is not outstanding. It is possible to get such an opportunity. The price behind it must be paid more than other big nobles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no end to the exploration in the magical world. Richard silently stopped the magic image, because the consumption of magic crystal also needs money. He placed the badge in a prominent position. All income and expenditure items have been engraved in memory, even stronger than memory magic, and then once again into the learning of the magic world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months passed in a blink of an eye. Every day, Richard is immersed in the world of magic and numbers, and he can hardly feel the passage of time. Now he has been able to master the two talents of wisdom and reality. The digital world is not only singular and boring, but also has many irreplaceable benefits. For example, as long as he is within his perception, Richard can understand the strength of others in the most intuitive way. For example, Minnie and Randolph, the other two students of Su Helun, are now five and six magicians, all still only fourteen. Minnie's magic is 70, and Randolph has reached an astonishing 110. The magic value alone is no different from the seven-level magician. Two people do not say the level of the teacher, that is, the magic power is far more than the magician of the same level. This means that they have more spell positions than their peers, which is the most direct power gap. What's more, to become a pro-disciple of Su Hailun, his blood must have special features, and his powerful blood ability is a key factor in determining the battle situation in the battles of many high-level professionals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
