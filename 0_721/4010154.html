			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard landed in dark blue, the three lions at the time of departure had already There was only one left, and the strongest lion's lion was almost falling from the last ten meters. As soon as it fell to the platform, he squatted down and spit out a bubble with blood, and he couldn't see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over from the back of the gryphon, and his body was still light and agile. When he landed, his legs were soft and he squatted directly on the floor. An abnormal flush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already two Masters standing next to the Deep Blue Griffin Station. They were sent by the Grey Dwarf to stay here day and night, waiting for the arrival of Richard. In the dark blue, as long as it is a mage, few people do not know Richard. This legendary mage was the most proud student of the year, and she was truly talented. In a short time, she became the royal architect of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two mages saw that Richard fell and was shocked and hurriedly picked him up. After a quick inspection, he found that Richard was only a long journey, too tired, resulting in disengagement. This is the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard saw Black Gold and Phil. In addition to the two most familiar people, Deep Blue's other great magisters almost arrived. After all, what Richard asked for was too big, and Black Gold and Phil could not decide. When I knew that Richard spent only a few thousand kilometers a day, and never sleeplessly flew from the shisha to the dark blue, and three consecutive heads of the gryphon, everyone was moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He insisted on going to see the legendary mage, even if she was asleep. It can be said that Su Hailun is the most vulnerable period. In this extraordinary period, if any other person is changed, it is impossible for the big magician to put him into the exclusive tower area of ​​the legendary mage. But everyone knows that Richard is a special one. It can be said that the legendary Master has been a very persistent desire for many years to achieve in Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magisters discussed it and finally agreed to let Richard try it. Now the legendary Master's tower area is all maintained by her elves, and no one else, including all the great Magisters present, are allowed to enter the tower area. These elves are not only different from real high elves, but also wisdom and power. Moreover, the legendary mage's tower area is full of disorganized time and space, that is, there is no guard. If no one leads, the rushing end will only be extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the initial formation of the time and space in the tower area is not the legendary mage deliberately creating a trap, but she has too many things, it is really impossible to put it down, so casually Opened up a large and small ectopic space, dedicated to the warehouse of things. Of course, these spaces are not as stable as the semi-planets. Over time, the entrances to some spaces begin to fluctuate. This level of spatial fluctuations certainly has no effect on the legendary mage, but for others it is the most terrible cutting edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the big mentors are not worried about the legendary Master, but Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard insisted on trying, so the gray dwarf was helpless, and Phil took Richard to the front door of the legendary mage’s exclusive tower area. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering heavy steel gate is very familiar in the eyes of Richard. The thick red ochre and the weathered lines are full of original beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two heavy steel doors with dark lines engraved with the Mithril magic array are rarely opened, because the legendary Master himself does not use it at all. When I came to the front door, the space suddenly fluctuated. A tall elf with a full anti-magic silver armor stepped out of the void. He held a huge secret silver hand hammer in both hands, and the momentum was deep. The two-handed hammer is a weapon that is almost impossible to appear in the hands of the elves, but it is extraordinary in the hands of this elf. No big magister will be willing to let this hammer lick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf said in a cold tone: "His Royal Highness has closed this area, and no one can enter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee stepped forward and said: "I am Richard, Richard Archimonde, the student of His Highness Su Hailun. I want to see the teacher, just take a look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf lifts Eyes open, revealing a pair of amber pupils. He glanced at Richard and suddenly said, "You can come in. Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the tower slowly opens, the elf hammers both hands Behind him, with Richard's step behind the door, step on the spiraling ladder, all the way up. Behind them, the magic 傀儡 pushed the steel door slowly to close, and black gold and Phil were kept outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard stood in the private area of ​​Su Helun, the place that made him remember as new and left him with a brilliant shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything here is exactly the same as the day. Time does not seem to leave any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystals on the walls and domes still exude a variety of shades of blue, giving a dreamy look to everything in the room. Blue. The clean and mirrored ground reflects a little bit of the Milky Way. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the Hengdong Mountains under the night sky are mysterious and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several black elf girls sent Richard to here, and quietly retired. One of them whispered in the ear of Li, before he left. "His Royal Highness is there. Don't worry about time, how long you want to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li looked at her finger, it was discovered that there was a square made of crystal in the space where the deep blue light glows and superimposed, and the legendary mage quietly lie on the crystal platform. The face is quiet and sleepy. Against the sky blue crystal stage, her skin is so soft that it seems to be slightly pressed and will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Su Hailun again, but did not expect this situation to be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pass, but stood quietly, I don’t know how long. Finally, he took a difficult step, slowly came to the front of the crystal table, leaned down slightly, staring at the small face that was enough to make everyone reverse, for a moment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s blond hair is arbitrarily scattered, such as a waterfall flowing on the crystal table that swims on the star. However, as Richard approached, a blonde on her forehead suddenly moved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the legendary mage and the Faro gods battle asleep, there is no second thought in his heart, just thinking about the first time Go to the dark blue and look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, when he really saw Su Hailun, Richard suddenly did not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not even know that she had multiple injuries. Reconnaissance has no effect on her, and there is no magic reaction at all. And the legendary Master seems to be covered with an invisible force, and even Richard's true talent has lost its effect. The legendary mage in front of me is like a sleeping girl, no longer the majesty of the past, unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how would she go to fight with the Faro gods? That is the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the dense name of Clark’s book of the gods, there is something in Richard’s heart that is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his trembling hand and wanted to touch her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sly blonde on Su Hailun’s forehead suddenly cocked! Such as the rising snake head, glaring at Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked gazing and stared at the blond hair. The blond hair was erected more straight, and the tip was constantly shaking, seemingly demonstrating to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a hair of Su Hailun. This is Richard's first thought. However, the second thought is that this is the legendary mage's hair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the various thoughts that arise in his heart, Richard’s hand fell and fell to her face. Just as Richard's hand was about to touch the skin of the legendary mage, the blond hair seemed to be intolerable, piercing with lightning, and easily wearing the palm of Richard's hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain caused Richard’s eyebrows to lock together, but he did not take his hand back, but continued to fall until his fingertips touched Su Helen's skin. The hot blood constantly rushes out of the wound, dripping down the palm of the hand, and blooming a bloody flower on the white skin of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the blonde moved, reluctantly pulled out of Richard’s hand, and finally slammed it on the wound of the palm, it seems to be What was wiped, and then continued to erect, shaking and demonstrating to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took back his hand, not for anything else, but for fear of blood staining her blonde hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the edge of the crystal table, so quietly watching Su Hailun in the sleep, the injured right hand on the leg, let the blood soak The robes are slowly dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the legendary mage did not know how much he had quietly done for him, and how much he was given. Without a legendary mage, there would be no royal architects of today's Holy Alliance, nor a future holy architect. But now, she is sleeping here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping Su Helun is like an innocent girl, completely unable to connect with her legendary mage. Only in this way, Richard can sit comfortably beside her, quietly watching her, recalling a dream that was not true. If she does not sleep, even if Richard is free and easy, she will not be able to overcome the huge gap between her identity and strength, so she can stay so close to her. When she is awake, Su Hailun will be like a girl with a changing temperament, but her deep and deep power will make the most arrogant things look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, what Richard wants to do for her is similar to jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking of the picture in the depths of memory, Richard only felt a heavy thing on his heart, and he successfully returned to Novo for the first time. Rand, and the feeling that Gotton lost in the eclipse was very similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the feeling of what needs to be done for her, and it is also a feeling of responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee stretched out his right hand and gently wiped the blood on the face of the legendary Master. He whispered, "When you sleep peacefully, I will help you keep the dark blue." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sentence, Richard stood up and prepared to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s blonde hair was erected and stared at Richard with vigilance. It seemed to think that something bad was going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
