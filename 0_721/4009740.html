			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the game, for Richard, it should have been A normal day, but it becomes an extraordinary day, because this is the day when the mountains and the sea say goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months of getting along with each other, the shadow of the girl has been deeply imprinted in the heart of Richard. When the girl left, Richard followed the tradition of the young mountain and sent it to a few miles outside the dark blue, a gap in the Hengdong Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the intersection leading to the east, the mountains and sea that have been silent have finally stopped. The steel rock and other barbarian warriors drove the team forward and stopped until hundreds of meters away, leaving a space for the girl and Richard to leave alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am leaving, don't think too much about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I have always been able Control yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between teenagers and girls is always a bit awkward and one of the by-products of intimate life for months. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go, be my man! We have been living together for a few months, and then live together for more than a year, I can make a decision. Rest assured, I feel that I will not throw you into the sea at that time." The mountain and the sea persuaded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" Richard continued to reject it as always. This answer does not have to go through the brain, because in the past three months, it has been rejected several times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the sea, the little eyebrows are erected. This is the only thing she learned from Su Helun after spending thousands of tuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! If I take you away now, what can you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard immediately silenced. Because the threat of the girl is true and effective, although Richard can create the magic pattern, his own force is always lacking, which can be seen from the "small gift" that must be handed in every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter smile, Richard said: "I know that you feel good about me, but in the future you will always find a better taste."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea shook his head with force: "Even if there is a better taste, I am not interested. You go with me! Our saint totem is more than your magic The structure is more powerful and allows you to study for a lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helplessly, and he did not know how many times he answered the same question. I can only shake my head resolutely. He has already given the mountain and the sea the answer: "I can't go with you because I have something to do. You can catch me, but I can't get my consent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea are also silent, just staring at Richard. Richard suddenly found that in the depths of her eyes, there seemed to be something more unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the mountain and the sea raised their hands and untied a string of fangs tied to a scorpion, placed in the palm of Richard. One of the animal teeth in the middle is extraordinarily larger, and several holes are carved in it, which seems to be a whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is for you. You have to be close to you, you can't lose it." Shan and Hai said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at the beasts and looked at the mountains and the sea. He suddenly felt that the beasts in his hands were extraordinarily heavy. He thought about it and wrapped the animal teeth around his left wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard’s movements, the mountains and the sea finally showed a smile, saying: “I know that your Norland men are better than their own women. Some. So if you follow the custom of Noland, you want to be a man who can control me, then you must beat me, though... I can't see this possibility at all. But it doesn't matter, I will wait for that day. The arrival. You only need to blow the whistle in the middle of the beast, I will know. So, if one day you are killed, blow it, I will come to avenge you. If there is one day in the future If you want to be my man, then blow it when you step on the mainland of Calando, I will come to fight you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to say, I just think that this beast is burning like a fire, and he is almost breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea suddenly showed a smile full of sunshine, saying: "If you are beaten by me, I will throw you directly into the sea! Haha ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter of the mountains and the sea is flamboyant, and there is no artificiality. It was supposed to be a relaxed atmosphere, but Richard felt even heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now, the gift!" The girl approached Richard. Richard was almost instinctively helpless and gave up resistance. I didn't expect him to wait for the ‘father’, but a hug that surpassed the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am leaving!" After the mountain and the sea finished, he turned and strode toward the distant barbarian team. Her pace is so strong that every time it is trampled like a prehistoric behemoth, the earth is also trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was speechless and only waved. The mountains and the sea did not look back, but if they saw it, they also raised their right hands and swung their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises and stretches the girl's figure and casts it at the foot of Richard, as if she has never gone far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, the sun still shines on the ice floes, and the blue moon in the sky is looming. The wind began to get cold, and sporadic ice floes appeared on the sea. The number of sea-going vessels to and from the port has been significantly reduced, and ships with a slightly smaller displacement and are not resistant to ice floes have disappeared from the ice floes at this time. However, the port's busyness has not changed much. After the midsummer carnival, the number of ocean-going ships that can break the ice has increased dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day is a new beginning for Richard and a continuation of the past. From this day on, he can concentrate on exploring the world of the builder. However, his life rhythm has not changed. Every month, a fixed time, it is recorded that the pages of his activities are still dense, so that the gray dwarf can not breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When winter arrived, Richard made the first complete magical structure in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the standard primary agility, where Richard has made the first breakthrough. This structure is selected from the material processing until the plug-in is made. All the process steps are still done by Richard himself. There is no place for fake hands. In order to save time, the general builders will use the mature and processed media on the market. From the beginning of the interception of the original fur, Richard has made all the handmade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This junior agile used Richard for a full half-month, all the procedures are well-professed in the chest, when one step does not finish all the procedures, Li I found that my understanding of the magic pattern has taken another step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
