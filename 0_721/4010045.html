			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of hundreds of branch families gather together and want to enter The warehouse area of ​​the family castle. The old butler who rushed to the news stopped in front of the gate of the warehouse area, and righteously reprimanded those who wanted to make trouble. However, under his serious face, he could not hold back the worry of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that worries him is that the comparison of numbers is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hundreds of troublemakers, there are fewer than twenty of Gordon’s guards. Many of these guards were selected from the branch family. If it was not for the sake of strength, the old housekeeper would not bring them out. For both sides, there is a kinship relationship with each other. It is really a conflict. No one knows what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Here is the private library area of ​​Gordon adults. Whoever dares to enter, is rebellious!" The old housekeeper was very strong. But this time it no longer has enough effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebel?" Elvin came out in the crowd, holding a list of offerings in his hand and shouting: "You are just a man, Standing opposite you is Archimonde! What qualifications do you have to slap on us? And who is the real rebel? The list of sacrifices is here, they are all sacrifices belonging to Archimonde. If you don't have a ghost in your heart, why don't you dare let us in check? There are so many Archimonde, there are so many pairs of eyes, who dares to do it in the warehouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breathing, Elvin’s voice suddenly rose eight degrees: “I now suspect that there are less than half of the sacrifices in the warehouse! Those sacrifices have now become The gold coins in the pocket of this old guy!! Gordon adults trust him so much, now that Gordon is gone, how can we really sit on the real treasure of stealing adults?! You said, isn't it? !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of people screamed, the momentum was unparalleled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler did not think that these people would actually be rogue to this point, and the situation is clearly out of control. What disturbed him was that the freedom fighters who came from all over and volunteered to protect the floating island did not know why none of them appeared today. Although they are not many, they are all real fighters. Less than a hundred warriors are enough to shock these monkeys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, when they need them most, they don’t show up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper’s heart passed a huge shadow. Those who can suppress these freedom fighters, I am afraid, only the three giants of the Akmon family at the moment... No matter which one, it means a complete change of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Irvine’s questioning, the old butler was speechless. He smiled bitterly and said slowly: "Don't forget, the means of Gordon's adults! Don't forget, how many lives are in the hands of Gordon's adults! The miracle in the hands of adults..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin suddenly rushed, slamming his fist on the face of the old housekeeper! Under his steel-like fist, the bright red blood splattered, the old housekeeper snorted, and the body flew backwards, hitting the door of the warehouse! The old man's nose has been completely ruptured, and one eye swollen quickly, and he couldn't open it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呛! The accident happened suddenly, and the guards of Gordon were caught off guard by the time. The weapons were squirting, but they hesitated, and they did not really cut them out. The opposite is, after all, the people of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just want to guard the wealth of Gordon's adults and guard the wealth of Archimonde! The real Archimonde, let us act!" Elvin shouted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of branch family members swarmed up, squeezing through the love of Gotton and rushing into the warehouse. Those guards were squeezed, but they were overwhelmed. Without the orders of the old housekeepers, they really couldn’t help the people of the same family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler has no way to order, and Ervin is sullen and kicking his ribs on his ribs. The old butler couldn't speak at all. Every foot swallowed, and his mouth and nose would overflow a lot of blood, and he couldn't speak. Irvine started to be extremely vicious. He didn't rush into the warehouse, but madly kicked the old housekeeper. It wasn't until a Gotton guard was aware that he was still moving, murderous and screaming, and he stopped. Irvine stared deeply at the opposite guard, and the cold eyes contained endless grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort raised the old butler and stared at Irvine without shrinking, and the murder was getting stronger. He is a veteran with dozens of lives in his hands and will not be scared by Elvin. But he also knows that the situation is out of control, and the most urgent task is to save the old housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards guarded the old butler and retired, and the Akmons of the branch family finally got their wish and entered the warehouse area of ​​the castle. They did see a large number of sacrifices, but did not see the piles of gold coins in anticipation. There are no other things in the warehouse other than sacrifices and weapons. They can hardly imagine that the battle will be unprofitable and lay down the floating island. The Gordon sitting on four planes will be so poor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they soon wake up, Gordon must have a secret warehouse, and must hide the mountains of wealth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these red-eyed guys first robbed everything in the warehouse, but the meaning is still unfinished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The upper level of the castle!" Elvin yelled again, and the hysterical voice overwhelmed all the noise: "The upper level of the castle is the restricted area! All the treasures must be hidden there! Those things belong to our Archimonde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the top!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get back what belongs to us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams come and go, at this moment, the animal nature hidden in the blood After a complete attack, the mobs gathered into a river and rushed to the upper level of the castle. Something smart, but left the castle, to hide the sacrifices already grabbed. More people who couldn't grab the sacrifices rushed to the upper level of the castle with their red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Rebel?" A clear sip of shock instantly shocked the audience! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the passage to the upper level of the castle, stood a tall and graceful figure. It’s a beautiful girl, like a burning flame, beautiful and in full swing. Her eyes burned with flames, and the magic wand in her hand floated, and wild magic was shot at any time! Behind Yu Mei, Wennington and Venica stood still. Three young boys and girls, so in front of hundreds of crazy monkeys. Although these monkeys can tear them apart at any time, they are not afraid of it, and they are not going to give in. In the depths of everyone's eyes, there is rolling magma flowing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebel? Of course not! We just want to get back what belongs to us!" A voice screamed and it was Elvin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is my father, the Marquis of Gordon's restricted area! Who dares to take a step, killing!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irvine is in the crowd, his face is as dark as it is to drip. He strode to three young boys and girls and roared: "Everything here belongs to the entire Archimonde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you?! A small step knight, also known as Akmond?" Yan Mei looked at Elvin coldly, extremely disdainful. She suddenly raised the volume and shouted: "The real Archimonde will prove himself on the real battlefield with long swords, scars and enemy blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence, let a lot of people who rushed over and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin suddenly stepped forward and slammed his fist in the abdomen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 did not think that he would actually do it. The punch was so heavy that she was rolling over her internal organs. She is a curse, her physique is not outstanding, where can she withstand the full strength of the high-level knights?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blush of blood from the 黛The corner of the mouth ran down. Her body bent involuntarily and curled up to the ground. In the lingering light of her eyes, I suddenly saw the cold light of the short sword flash! The head of Yan Mei who was tortured by the pain was a bit sluggish. The intuition she got from the battlefield constantly reminded her of the danger, but she was still unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short sword? How can there be a short sword? Do these people want to kill themselves? On the floating island, killing the children of Gordon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing that sounds ridiculous, seems to happen soon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought in Elvin’s heart is intertwined with cruelty and **. In the current position, the arrogant chest of Yan Mei almost squeezed out from the neckline, and the hot body made him rush, so I can't wait to tear the woman's clothes on the spot. If in the past, he could not have encountered a finger of 黛 !! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he will mourn forcibly, the short sword is slipping out of the sleeves. Irvine is very clear about the value of the sacrifices in the warehouse. What is the difference between the sacrifices of Gotton and the children who killed him? It’s better to smash the roots immediately! And as soon as the sword goes down, these people will be tied to him in a chariot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not just Archimonde's ambitions!" In the heart of Irvine, a voice was desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his eyes turned cold, and the inside of the body was already full of thunderous power. After all, Winnington and Winika did not go to the battlefield. At this time, the reaction was slowed down. Obviously, I still didn't understand why Mei Mei suddenly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity! A fleeting opportunity! Elvin’s chest is burning with flames, and it’s going to be stabbed with a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one hand came out from the side, and a man who had not completely fallen down was taken away. This is a beautiful, slender hand with the same style of armor and armor. The patterns of the flame-like colors clearly outline a coat of arms, which is the coat of arms of the Count of Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin looked up, but saw the other hand expand rapidly in front of his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
