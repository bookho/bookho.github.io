			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats in the audience were greatly astonished and arguing, but buzzing The argument was terminated because of Richard’s "but!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to announce one thing. That is, in the name of the great goddess of water, hunting and forest, I declare that this person is a sly God's heresy. He will be executed on the spot, and his family territory will be levied by the church, and his family will be deprived of all rights, become the property of the church, serve hard labor until death. Sentencing ... immediately executed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold voice of Richard echoed throughout the House of Lords, but the content was beyond the imagination of everyone. No one thought that Richard would actually fight back in the name of the true God, and the counterattack was so decisive, leaving no room for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s none of my business, it’s none of my business!!" The young jazz suddenly burst into tears, and the cries of sorrow tingled all the nobles. Ear mask. He used both hands and feet, and even climbed to climb the platform to escape the sudden demon. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei both holding the fate of the twins with a gentle wave, the fallen angel's wing tip shot a bloody thin lightning, hit the back of the young jazz . The lightning first smashed through his body silently, then turned into dozens of tiny electric lights, climbed the body of the young jazz, burned him into a charred body, and the body remained in a running position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles were a little quiet, and then a few angry roars rang through the halls of the House of Lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! You are challenging all the nobles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no rights Feel free to kill a nobleman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See it! He is an intruder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard's voice expanded dozens of times under the influence of magic, and easily suppressed the roar of all nobles. He ordered a few times from the crowd and said, "Catch these people on the stage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavily armed knights slammed into the crowd, no matter what Is it a pain or a knockdown of a noble noble? They are so powerful that they can knock back seven or eight nobles and even fly straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of chaos, an old aristocrat suddenly screamed: "The town is strong!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This exclamation is like the same basin of ice water, and instantly poured the blood of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry to the House of Lords is the construction of the knight, the worst overall strength is close to the level of the Faro Sanctuary, those of Noland, and Agamemnon The knights all surpassed the Sanctuary of Faro. The headed Chengcheng Knight has the strength to surpass the Faro Town Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in the blink of an eye took four people out of the crowd and threw them in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at these people without looking at them, but said to the nobles with a constant cold voice: "I am the goddess of the three goddesses, but also The executors of the goddess of the three goddesses. Even the accusations that I am an intruder are regarded as blasphemy! Now these four people will be executed on charges of blasphemy, but my kindness, their family will be forgiven. Sentencing, immediate execution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for the nobles to react, the four builders of the knights pulled out the sword and penetrated the hearts of the four nobles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles were another scream, and they remembered that these four people seemed to have smashed Richard as an intruder. There are still bold and brave aristocrats who have accused Richard of violating the aristocratic rules and violating the laws of the kingdom, but have never heard the charges of the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you represent the three goddesses!" A young nobleman bravely called. His courage is admirable, because when Richard appeared, he killed five people with thunder and did not give anyone a chance to react and protest. In the name of God, it seems to have occupied the name of the righteousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a soft and sweet voice coming from the door of the House: "I can testify that Richard is the goddess of the three goddesses and the executor of the gods." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Philin, but today’s Philippine wears the full priest’s costume, holding a long blue-blue scepter, and the solemn crown of the head reveals Her status as a pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance of Philen, the nobles were both surprised and angry, even the Pope of the goddess of spring water came to the House of Nobles. The symbolism of this move is greater than the actual meaning. This means that the Three Goddess Church publicly stated that this dispute between Richard and the Sequoia nobles was intervened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusation that Richard is an intruder is tantamount to accusing the three goddesses of conquering the devil. This is a very serious incident. If the accusation is a secular aristocracy, then it is a war between the nobility and the church. If the accuser is a priest of a god, it may lead to a war of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a few months ago, the aristocrats did not have much fear of the weak church. But the situation is different now, because Richard has joined the camp of the three goddesses. Even if the situation is bad enough to start the war of God, perhaps the goddess of war will be at a disadvantage, but the secular church may be uprooted by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time another old nobleman walked out of the crowd and pointed to Richard, and said angrily: "Licha! He is just a beggar, there is another ambassador behind the scenes." People! You should go to the Lord's Messenger, he is your true enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old aristocrat also has extraordinary courage. In fact, in times of frequent wars, nobles often have the courage to dare to sacrifice. For those who have faith, death is the beginning of a new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s answer made the old nobles, and even the many nobles present, feel surprised: “I know that he is only being shackled. I certainly won’t I have let go of the ambassador, but I will never be tolerant! In my eyes, the ambassador and the sin are the same sin. Anyone who wants to be enemies with me needs to be considered clearly, no matter what they are out of. For whatever reason, I will never be tolerant! Therefore, the enemies that rush to me, whether they are jealous or ambassadors, will uproot their family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This declaration made everyone shocked and lost their voice. Finally, Richard suddenly smiled and said, "Everyone, you have been very happy here since these days. But now, the game is over. I declare that the following people are not welcome by the church, all their interests in the blood-stained land will be deprived, and they will not enter any area covered by the church. At the same time, their territory must be open to the church personnel, so that The priests of the goddess spread their faith. These unwelcome people include: Viscount Shanglin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long list with a big list Small and small aristocrats, even including an earl! Being listed, it means becoming the target of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Richard's brave means of killing the nobility in the House of Lords, you can know that once the nobility on the list dares to block the entry of the so-called 'church personnel', Richard will definitely send troops out to extinguish them. The war of faith in history is full of blood and darkness. This time is no exception. The list includes families worshipped by ancestors and believers of the gods of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can also interpret this list from another secular point of view. Most of these people are running around and want to separate the interests of Richard in the blood of the land. People, some of the most determined kings, and some are the aristocrats who intervened in the inheritance of the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the list is announced, the House of Lords is in vain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past month, the House of Lords was the battlefield for them to crusade Richard. It seems that there is nothing to say about Richard. There is nothing missing in today’s life. The quiet state of Richard's side has always fueled their arrogance. Until today, until Richard revealed his fangs, these noble members of the parliament discovered that they were so weak and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked off the stage and led the followers and the knights to leave the House of Lords. On the podium, five bodies were still there, and blood was flowing all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the door of the House of Lords and rush to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers who stayed in the outer square were standing in a neat lineup, and almost the same number of kings were on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu stood at the forefront, constantly waving his hands and hammers, and provoked the opposite garrison. The power of the two-headed ogre is almost universally known in Faro. The commander of the garrison is only an eleventh-level warrior. The gas pressure of the ogre is almost unstable, and there is still the courage to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the unicorn, and immediately asked, "Tiramisu, what is going on?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu sighed and replied: "They suddenly came out and said that we violated the laws of Wangdu and asked us to let go of our arms and surrender!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you talked to them for a long time?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre has two faces at the same time, and some are embarrassed to say: "I am afraid to give you trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "It’s right, after all, it’s Wangcheng. It’s not good to kill too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, Suddenly there was a sudden hoof, and a horseman in a red cloak rushed into the square at full speed, and then arranged into a neat queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights are well-equipped, the ranks are all above the tenth level, and the faces are all arrogant. For the first big-faced big man to stand up, he screamed: "I am the head of the Royal Defence Knights! You are allowed to lay down the weapons within ten counts, otherwise you will kill the ground!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the ground to kill?" Richard laughed and turned to Jonde and said, "A seventeen-level guy, how long does it take you to kill him?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s face was awkward and said: “Give me more magic and magic. It’s enough to cut him only three axes!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the opposite Guard Knights and turned to Shand and said, "Okay! They have two hundred rides, Gangde! I will give you twenty structures." Install the knight. Go, let me see, how are they going to kill you on the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
