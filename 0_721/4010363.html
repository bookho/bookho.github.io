			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of guests who didn’t get their hands were naturally not so satisfied, and some people asked for Richard Doka Some of the auction items have even been proposed to buy Richard's costume knights at a premium.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the royal family and the sacred alliance giants look a bit ugly<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final auction will end as scheduled. Richard faces the unwillingness to disperse. The promise is to hold another auction in half a year and will publicly sell several non-standard paintings. The cake has made people swear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to receiving a large income, Richard has completely established his position. His current fees have been Not among other big builders, even among the big builders who can make the fourth-order structure, it is also an upstream level, which obviously benefits from his large number of non-standard construction and suit design capabilities<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the floating island, Richard first received and sent away the messengers from the royal family and several giants to put all the nights The invitation was rejected and then it was time to make a formal meeting with the legendary Master named Nelson<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson had a dark face full of storms The taste of erosion is tall and tall. The skinny style of the tight-fitting waist is no different from the fishermen on the beach. There are several shark skin shorts in the waist<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he first saw him, he smelled the smell of the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Nelson. The Big Island from the mainland of Wales in the middle of the mainland is in our language. Britain is 'Sunshine shines forever' means that our generation has survived at sea for the rest of the year. I spent half of the year in the sea." Nelson briefly introduced himself and then took out a box and placed it in Richard's Said in front of: "This is the reward for this suit"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just opened the lid and suddenly an indescribable stench is coming out. This is a mix. Wet and dirty suffocation and a strong murder The gas of the cockroach seemed to scream in the room at the moment the lid opened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked into the box and saw a fist-sized pearl The crystals are lying on the bottom surface of the box and still oozing out the illusion of water mist condensing into a strange shape of deep sea creatures. Richard covers the lid and looks at Nelson waiting for further explanation<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the essence left by a legendary creature dragon turtle before it dies. It has risen from the deep sea for some reason and came to the shore so I have a chance to kill it. But this war has also lost a few holy places in the Kingdom of Britain. Thousands of warriors and dozens of warships in the field are the top sacrifices, but because of the little soul fragments that seal the dragon turtles inside, they can also be used as the driving energy for some special magic arrays.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said after a moment of indulging: "The energy contained in this dragon turtle essence may be higher than your auction price"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson smiled and said: "It doesn't matter if I have the same high quality requirements for the suit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am good at the field of star power and flame I am afraid that there is a conflict with the sea environment where you are often in the process. The effect of the package and the user's configuration and bearing capacity are not entirely dependent on me." Richard's instructions<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All I want is that you try your best, so please pay for this reward." I pushed the box to the front of Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I just need a sacrifice. It’s rude. Which one is needed? When can I see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is here" Nelson said that he took a very old silver bottle from his arms and began to silently recite the spell. As his magic began to surge like a tidal wave, the strong winds of Nelson's hair fluttered in the wind, and the long, gray hair that grew into a stubborn hair seemed to have its own spirituality constantly exploring in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just an illusion and the illusion is that he can’t bully Richard’s eyes. Naturally, he’s streaming out of a sneak peek. So it’s no longer a dance on Nelson’s head. The bun is actually a viper. This Nelson has a long snake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Nelson suddenly opened his eyes and exposed it in lizards and snakes. The golden yellow cockerel stared at Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li The eyes are more like a giant beast roaring and screaming all the consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is still reluctant to go to Richard The soul rushed directly to the past, but when its minions would touch the soul of Richard, the huge wave of beasts that suddenly burst into a deep red flowing melt in front of them would not be able to plunge into the melt and immediately screamed and then it The image suddenly becomes thin and dim and then disappears.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of calls from "Li Richard" sounded in the ear of Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened from the world of consciousness. He opened his eyes and only felt his eyes. It’s sour and bloated, even the things look very vague. At this moment, a cool power falls on his body. It’s the magic of pure water. It’s like a cleansing and cleansing the pain in the eyes of Richard’s eyes<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that it was Nelson’s shot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several gods falling on Richard However, they don't use any of the legendary wizards at this time. The speed of instant magic is much faster than that of Iowa, Naiyou, etc., and it is more targeted and more effective.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nelson is full of apologies: "I am sorry that I did not think that you can actually see my magical disguise. Generally only the legend can see the truth. The reason why I don't use real appearance is because my snake can burn any seeing them. Creatures and they instinctively launch a soul attack on the target, but what I didn’t think of is you The power of the soul is so strong, but they are so badly wounded that I am more reassured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw that Nelson had changed It looks like a body has shrunk a little more than before and the facial features are still the original appearance, but the outline is softer and thus shows a beautiful appearance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on her head With a dark blue cap, all the hair was wrapped around but the surface of the cap was still undulating. Richard immediately thought that the dozens of snakes I saw just now couldn’t help but have some creeps.<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nelson’s attitude is sincerely inspected by Richard. This little episode is now cured. However, Nelson is obviously not human or at least part of it is not human. She is actually a female. And there may be a close connection with the famous snake-haired banshee in the underground world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard noticed that there was already a tall boy next to Nelson. Red/naked upper body The bodybuilder has a dark blue hair that floats like a wave. The boy has deep blue eyes. At this moment, he is staring at Richard. All eyes are alert and afraid.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and turned around a few rounds of the boy’s eyes, and he fired like a flame. Every time the boy vibrated and wanted to make an attack, Nelson continued to use it. The hand touches the head of the boy, and the magical water element magic flows down her hand to water the boy, which will calm him down<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Richard completed the process of analysing the boy. He walked back and forth in the room for a few laps before raising his head and said to Nelson: "I have never said that I can design a costume for the aliens. I have had it at the auction." Explicitly state that the design kit should be human-based or at least have a majority of human bloodlines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nelson’s face was struggling and nervous and said: "I know this. But...but this child and human beings are very similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said helplessly: "His Royal Highness Nelson does grow like humans but The lizard half-orc warrior, which has no resemblance to human appearance, is probably closer to blood than he is to humans. What I have been studying is how to add a structure to humans that rarely involves aliens.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That... Is there no hope at all? I can increase the price. I still have something you will be interested in." Nelson untied a shark skin bag at the waist and put it on his teeth. In front of Richard<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not move the leather bag but looked at Nelson’s eyes and said, “First of all, I need to know what your purpose is and what kind of goal he wants to achieve”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stronger the strength, the better, even if you can only grow a little bit of combat power is worth it. I think that only the structure can make him improve his combat ability in the shortest time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped on the table and said nothing in the living room. The atmosphere in the living room quickly became depressed and overwhelmed.<br /><br />&nbsp </ br> </ br> Nelson's face is uncertain and nervous and some expectation while the teenager is looking at the followers who are behind the line, especially the three priests, which makes him look a little cringe. But constantly drifting to Zonghu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen or heard of my previous set of guidelines?" Richard asked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing that I have studied the design of the Secret Guide in detail, it is full of creativity and genius. The reason is that I came to you to see if you can design a set for this kid... It’s ok to build a second order.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, Licha’s beckoning teenager, the beastly juvenile, took a step toward Richard and no longer wished to move. Richard immediately released a detection technique and landed on him and carefully observed the magic reaction. Start thinking again<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
