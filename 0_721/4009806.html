			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard and Liusha returned to the forward base. Now Richard has come up with a clue to prioritize the next step, first by getting intelligence, including information from the baron and the surrounding area. The second is to strengthen the combat effectiveness of all people, and finally to solve the problem of recruiting troops in this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to the base, all the people who were injured by the contractual powers rushed back to the base and saw that Richard was relieved to be relieved. So Richard re-allocated the mission. This time, Gangde, Shuihua and Oral three people to detect the terrain. The ogre who has been awake has helped the Cavaliers to clean up the battlefield and renovate the equipment. Tiramisu needs to show his ability in magic, he has to copy a lot of familiar language scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolving language problems is the first step in the ectopic face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the progress of the trial of Elf Oral is unsatisfactory, Richard decided to personally interrogate the prisoners and use sand as an aid to prevent Richard from losing his hand. Dead captives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral had already asked something, but his technique was too gentle, so he was stuck at some key points. For example, how many jazz lords are there, how many troops there are, what the original follow-up plan is, the terrain and power distribution map of the baron territory, and the elves get contradictory rhetoric that cannot withstand scrutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of crisis that is looming over the heart has made Richard completely lose patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, every hour of the past, the danger may multiply, maybe the baron’s army is already on the road, and even the gods may With new orders, how can he still waste precious time for these prisoners? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li took a shackle into the small but well-equipped interrogation room at the base, the two prisoners who were able to take the penalty were inexplicably At the same time, a cold war was struck, and it seemed that the light in the room was even more bleak with the entry of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two captives were bruised and bruised, but the injuries were not heavy. They are all in their thirties, with a strong will, a strong body, and a good strength. The level of the five-level fighter is a guarantee that they can survive. Their eyes are sharp and they are experienced veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at them a few times and knew that such people were relatively difficult to deal with, but they were not without solutions. There are only two kinds of people who can't solve torture. It is someone who has a passionate belief or who has to guard everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the veterans are also observing Richard. When I saw Richard's expressionless calm face and a pair of long, delicate and stable hands, I couldn't help but look different. When the seeing sands followed closely, the two veterans who had successfully teased the elf poet finally changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly checked the tools at hand, and then looked at the injuries of the two veterans, and the action was skillful. This set of procedures, he has already practiced in Naa's kitchen, I don't know how many times, even without thinking about anything, it can be applied without any mistakes. This is one of the most authentic methods in the dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time he walked into the interrogation room, Richard did not say anything, just doing his own thing silently. The two veterans are not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Hey! Kid, what do you want?" When Richard hangs the chain on a veteran, he finally can't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the veteran is screaming, intimidating, or confessing to the facts, Richard is ignorant, just hangs him up and picks up the tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!! I cursed you! The pagans who took the fire column!" The vows of the veteran screamed out of the interrogation room and passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the volume of the ear, Richard’s movements are consistently fast and stable, never stopping. A piece of clean tool quickly stained the flesh and blood, and was thrown away, and the sand was also treated with micro-injury. In five minutes, Richard has used all the tools, and the sand has been treated with seven minor injuries. The veterans hanging in the air have no power to roar, and they can only get out of the throat with ambiguous embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next one." This is the first sentence that Richard said after entering the interrogation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Don't touch me, I said! What do you want to know, I said!...... ah!!" A former veteran was laid down, second The veteran was hoisted. Richard didn't plan to stop to listen to what he was going to say, but to start repeating the previous operation at a constant rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was another five minutes, the tool was used for the second time, and the sand was treated with six minor injuries and a more powerful treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two veterans were put back in the same place, still bruised and bruised, and it seemed to be no different from ten minutes ago, but the unruly eyes in the eyes have completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Richard threw the blood-stained tool into a bucket filled with cold water, washed his hands and then sat in front of two veterans, faint Question: "Now, what do you want to tell me? Oh, in addition, I will remind you that the priests only use one-third of the mana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a few minutes, Richard knew everything he wanted to know. He broke the problem again and repeatedly asked several times to confirm that the two veterans did not lie. In the process, the two veterans fainted several times and were awake by the ice water. Richard will not let them stun, no need to use refreshing spells. In this case, the ice water works best, especially the whole body is covered in damp and bitter cold, constantly dripping from the tip of the hole, and along the back. The water that climbs down is the best refreshing agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that nothing can be asked, Richard and Liusha looked at each other and noticed the hidden worry of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been confirmed that this is indeed a secondary plane with high-end force. The base of the forward base is the territory of the Principality of Baiyan. This area is complex, mostly mountain ranges and forests. There is a river more than ten kilometers away. After the mountainous area, it is a rich alluvial plain. At the turn of the river is the castle and port city of Baron Fossa. The High Jazz is one of the five jazzs of the Baron Fossa. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plane has abundant rain and rich land, developed farming technology and abundant food, so it has naturally spread a large number of people. The territory of Fossa removes mountains and forests, and the area where humans can live is only a few hundred square kilometers, but there are close to 200,000 people. Corresponding to the huge population base, Baron Fossa has retained a standing army of more than a thousand people and has dozens of sealed knights. According to the tradition of this plane, the Knights who rely on personal strength and merits to obtain the Knights' title are called the sealed knights, and they will get a small manor as a fief. The civilians who are of civilian origin can only become the captive knight if they reach the tenth level by force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
