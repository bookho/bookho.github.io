			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Cold Iron Throne, the soldiers of the brigade are coming out of the military camps Going to the square where you gathered together, then heading to the city wall and the city gate, in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of alarm bells all over the city are ringing together, and the high and low bells can’t cover the bleakness, just like proclaiming this Even if the city is ruined, the residents of the city are not alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the vision of hundreds of scouting beasts, Richard saw that most of the buildings were closed, and only men on the streets came and went. At dozens of assembly points, many adult men of different styles are lining up to receive weapons and shields, while younger boys gather on one side, giving them short swords and short bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard knows the determination of the city to fight against death, because the men know that they are civilians at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stepped on the brain and flew near the emperor at a height of 100 meters, overlooking the vicissitudes of the giant city from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came alone and looked unusually arrogant, but now that he has just killed the legendary powerhouse, his demonstrations have given the city Brings extra heavy pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is at this time, Richard has no need to hide too much, his brain, star, etc. have long been known, seeing the strange appearance The young mage who came from the floating magical creatures, everyone in the emperor knows that this is the deep red grandson personally coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is so low at this moment that the soldiers on the city’s head can shoot, but no one has done it, killing Gao De’s The strong, not ordinary soldiers can hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, suddenly there is an elderly big magister in the emperor, and Licha is surprised. At this time, it can only mean Challenge him, but unless it is a legendary strongman, anyone under the legend who challenges Richard is basically sent to death. The old magician should be aware of the gap between himself and Richard, but it is courageous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the old magician, there are dozens of strongmen who have taken off and seeing this number, Richard knows that the entire Iron Triangle Empire The town's strongmen are basically here. If they still have a minimum of people defending the dragons and the borders of the estuary, then there should be a few strong people who have long been reclusive in the throne. In front of my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely facing dozens of township strongmen, Richard is still calm, not even trying to open the distance between the two sides, he raised an eyebrow and said faintly: "The strong confrontation, this is not the way to use soldiers, if Li Shilong Lord is still there, will tell you that you should hide in the ordinary soldiers of the army, and then go to the critical moments of the war to try to create the biggest kill, or to find ways to kill several core figures in my army."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Richard’s almost ridiculous, the town’s strongman of the Iron Triangle Empire hovered in place, and said nothing, only the oldest demons The mentor slowly moved forward, and the mage robe on his body was gorgeous and complicated, and the magical radiance of the road was extinguished. According to Faro's standard, the higher the magical instrument, the stronger the magician's ability, so even before the eyes The old magister seems to be old enough to plant the ground at any time, and is still a strong person who can't be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not even show that the old magician was a little closer, and even had leisure time to look at other townships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magisters flew directly to less than thirty meters from Richard and stopped, then said: "His Royal Highness, it will take a long time to call you Knocked down, we have already seen the scene of the great King of Gold, the descendant of Gao De'ao, who is comparable to the gods. They all know the final outcome of the war. There are more and more powerful towns and strongmen. Compared with the deep red Principality that can kill the legend, since this is the case, we are more willing to play a decisive battle. Even if we are killed on the spot, it does not matter. As we reduce the trouble for you, I hope that you can go to the city. The civilians opened the net. I heard that you mentioned the massacre when you were in the final battle with His Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but asked : "You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Royal Magi, Harry, the current father of the Emperor is my brother," said the old magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "The cold iron throne can't pass this night, this city will break, so at this time, I don't have to promise you any conditions, if You think that a sneak attack can hurt me or my followers. Even if you try and want me to restrain the behavior of the army, there is only one condition. All of you in the towns and towns will surrender. Otherwise, see you on the battlefield. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry suddenly widened his eyes, but Richard had turned around and flew back, not paying any attention to leaving their backs to them, the Royal Devil The tutor wanted to rush, and the distance of tens of meters was within reach. There was no magic fluctuation in Richard. It seemed that he had not done any protection, but Harry’s grip was sweaty, but he never dared to make a blow. Just now he When I stepped closer to Richard, I actually started the temptation. Who knows that Richard actually left him from the beginning and did not do any protection. Instead, he suppressed the big magician and could not find a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard suddenly turned around and realized that all eyes looked like Harry was full of cold. "This is a war, not a boring game between the strong. In addition, not everyone is as willing to bury the empire as you are." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard reached out and connected to the virtual air for more than a dozen times. Every time, there will be a cloud in the sky. When the clouds are neutral, the electric light flashes faintly. It is like the seven-level magic thundercloud lightning that Harry is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundercloud lightning is not a very difficult magic, but seeing Richard’s understatement of a dozen seven-level magic, the face of everyone on the Iron Triangle Empire All changed, just relying on this magical ability, even if they shot a sneak attack, they would definitely not be cheap, and the first ones that rushed up must die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundercloud’s location is concentrated at the gates, and Harry is not going to let them continue to take effect, bombarding the guarded soldiers, so he takes out a reel and sends out A tornado, trying to blow the thunderclouds away, the eight-level tornado swept through the thunderclouds, but these thunderclouds are completely different from ordinary magic thunderclouds, and the powerful magic tornadoes simply blow them away, instead pushing them Faster into a piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gates of the city, there was a huge thundercloud with a radius of hundreds of meters. The thunderclouds were indefinite, and there was a faint starry sky inside. Taste, and Thundercloud began to extract the energy of the surrounding space to expand itself, the suction is large, and it has caused a huge black cloud vortex in the sky above the cold iron throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds in the sky hang down like a funnel, slowly approaching Thundercloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t let them meet." Old Harry screamed, and the magic and scrolls poured into the giant thunderclouds like rain, but Thundercloud was too big at the moment, old Every attack by Harry can only make it dissipate a small piece, but the energy it immediately extracts can make up for the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Harry’s magic is pouring out, and no scrolls are touched in the pocket. The Royal Magister’s mentor is watching and gradually fading with the dark clouds in the sky. As one of the Thunderclouds, he slowly looked back and saw that only one big magister was attacking Thundercloud with him. The other five big magisters did not move, and even one was still quietly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the town’s strong players are on Richard’s body, and now the distance between the two sides is still within the range of magical attacks, and it’s clear that the deep red Dagong is completely beyond the magic. After the power of common sense, the strong people began to worry that they would become the next target. Richard did not care about them. After seeing Lei Yun fully integrated into the sky clouds, he flew back to his own camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
