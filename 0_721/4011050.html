			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Empire has always paid attention to the intelligence gathering of the high elves in the Cangqing continent. The four superpowers of the Elven Empire are the key targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful place of the Holy Elf King is his speed and combat skills. Once the battle enters his rhythm, it will be squally The offensive directly destroyed the opponent completely. In the pervasive offensive of St. Cassie, as long as you make a mistake, it is equal to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina has a power level that is not yet available, but her status is here, and her knowledge is not bad. The next heart is also raised. Some of hers don't understand. Richard clearly has many powerful skills. He is not even a warrior. Why do you put your own advantages aside and even fight with St. Kathy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Richard making a mistake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question will soon have an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden scream in the sky, and a bright blood flower appeared. St. Cassie showed up in the air, and one left foot had disappeared. His figure flashed away, and only the blood drop from the air depicted the trajectory of his escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step forward, shook his head, and took his foot back and slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk looked at Richard with a different look and asked, "How can it be so fast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The battle between the two super powers, especially this kind of competition skills, it is normal to play for a few days or even ten days. However, I did not expect that even for ten minutes, St. Cassie fled. With the Goshawk's understanding of both sides, there is no such big gap in their combat skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled and said, "I can't make mistakes, but he can't make mistakes. He always dances on the blade, and there will inevitably be pressure. St. Kathy is no. Withstood the pressure, the result gave me the opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goshawk nodded and understood the meaning of Richard, but he always felt that there seemed to be something else. I did not make it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two men’s combat skills have reached the peak of their own field, even if there is a gap, it is only the oppression of Richard, let St. Casey from the beginning In the end, I had to maintain the peak of the offensive. This all-out attack relied heavily on physical strength and was later supported by willpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, it was only fixed for several hours under the continuous pursuit of Richard. Now, Richard’s combat strength is advanced, and St. Kathy, who has a similar fighting style, is not as strong as it is. Significantly shortened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But St. Casey should have said that it should last more than an hour, but he collapsed much earlier than Richard expected. It can be seen from this that the will of the Holy Elf is not a little bit worse than the indeterminate will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But few people can compete with the unscrupulous madman, perhaps Richard is one. But the high elves who used to live comfortably in the Cangqing mainland can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at a hand-drawn map from the Theo. Yangs, saying, "Let's go, today we can walk out of the forest and reach the flowers." It’s plain. There is a city here, we can spend the night there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha refers to the city of trailing flowers. This is a medium-sized city with a tree of life at the center of the city. It is a quiet city with elves. It is chosen by many elf artists as a place of residence because of its beautiful scenery and tranquility. Even the court poet Faral has a villa here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard marched toward the city of Tail Flower, Elf Wang Ting boiled again. St. Kathy, who has never lost for centuries, has been defeated by Richard. It is a shock to the high elves who can't look down on human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor blocked the news for the first time, and then called the crowd together again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elf king in charge of the military first said: "In the past few wars, we have a total of 80,000 troops defeated, including the total number of war dead and seriously injured. Nearly 20,000 people. At least half of the remaining fighters need to pass the blessing of the Moon Temple to regain their strength and re-enter the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other The Great Elf King released the magical images of the Richards march and said, "We now know the strength of Richard. He has two powerful legendary powerhouses and has a high-level military protection of scale. In this way Our opponents, we must fight hard to defeat them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Druid said: "We can't let Richard escape to the sea. I forgot that there was a terrible fleet in Samui, and the short contact war defeated the Third Fleet. Once Richard returned to his fleet, he could block us and all our fleets could not go out to sea. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several big elf kings looked at each other and said, "It is blocked. It seems that there is no big deal. We don't need any communication with Noland. The green continent and the elf empire left us. In the top ten planes, any resources we need can be found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement, most of the high elves nodded slightly, deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of high elves in the Elven Empire has grown slowly due to low fertility, and the number of higher elves has tripled since the retreat to the Cangqing continent for nearly a thousand years. Not half of the era of the Elven Empire. For these high elves, the resources left over from the Cangqing Continent and the Elven Empire have been inexhaustible. How can there be motivation to trade and develop? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their eyes, trade and plane development are things that humans, orcs, dwarves, and some low-lying elves can do. Their greed and ugly nature are destined to embark on such a path of blood and plunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Richard really blocks our offshore, we just need to withdraw the elves along the coast to the mainland, not on the line? At that time, Richard will land. I can only get some empty cities, and I can't find anything." One big elf king suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this be!" St. Druid was unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Elf Emperor meditated and nodded slowly, saying: "This is also a solution. Anyway, we have some symbolic exchanges with the Millennium Empire. In addition, there is no communication with the dirty and ugly races on Noland. When the coastal zone is vacated, Richard will not be able to supply it. After a long time, he will naturally go back."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we still have two royal court fleets! Is it so eager to watch the human fleet patrolling our gates?" St. Druid was very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many of our main battleships are the wealth left by the Age of Empires. If they are like the Third Fleet...we can't make that There are many main battleships. "The sound of the Great Sacrifice of the Moon Temple is very slow, but it is like a needle, and it is stabbed in the hearts of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the elf empire was destroyed, the high elves who fled to the green continent were successfully escaping from Noland in the case of being chased. In the process, the treasures of many elf empire have been lost, including the complete manufacturing process of the magic warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hundreds of years since then, the high elves of the Cangqing continent have been groping, but the key magical techniques have always been difficult to pass. Even more because there is no god of the elves of the Age of Elves, and it is impossible to create several of the most critical wizard-driven cores, so the counterfeit warships are completely incomparable to the battleships of the Elven Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past millennium, the elves of the Cangqing continent still progressed slowly on the magic warships. Now it is only barely able to build a warship of about the size of an imperial magical warship, but the combat power is only two-thirds of the Imperial version. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so main ships left over from the Empire, it can now be said that one ship will be permanently lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, several senior elves discussed and discussed, and the final conclusion was that if Richard used his magical fleet to block the sea, then he would The first and second fleet of the court were transferred to the east coast. This decision actually waits to hide all the warships to avoid losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how ridiculous this is, it eventually passed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the decision was made, they have to go back to the question that cannot be solved, how to solve the investigation that is marching toward the Elf Wangting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be a battle!" The great elf king in charge of the war shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Druid said: "First think of ways to cut off Richard's army, and then hold down the two legendary powers around him. Then I shot with His Majesty. It is possible to leave Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to cut off the terrible army of Richard's as many as five thousand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elf who is in charge of the war, Wang Yiran said: "Export all the frosty iron rides! My blade will personally lead the team and will definitely defeat the army of Richard!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other elves in Wang Tingzhong’s face are greatly changed. They silently read the word of the frosty iron ride several times, then slowly nod one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the magic warships, the Frosty Iron Rider is also a precious legacy left by the Age of the Elven Empire. It is known as the most powerful unit on the land, even the Orc's Bi Meng Beast Legion. It should be slightly inferior. This is a powerful army that can face the abyss of the Devil's Legion. It is one of the guarantees that the Elf Empire was unbeaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
