			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the big guys are looking for a variety of high-sounding reasons, Richard has appeared in front of a manor. The same is a fireball, the main escort power in the manor: a few young and strong scorpions and militia sent to the sky. Then Richard Chaan sat down and reached out and pointed forward. A group of soldiers with only a round shield and a steel knife rushed into the manor. They are all captured prisoners tonight, so only weapons are not given to armor. However, after the main escort power of the manor was swept away, the number of the troops was enough to suppress the resistance of the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the manor, a sealed knight finally appeared neatly, wearing his body plate took him too much time. And he just appeared on the battlefield with great prestige, and he was stared at by Gangde and Shuihua. A minute later, the captive Knight became a prisoner. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Richard led a large number of teams to set off again, passing through two other manored knights, so there were two more Sealed the knight. At dawn, I arrived at the final destination of Woodtown, and it was also the original seal of Sir Mintel. This time, Mrs. Gao’s wife will soon have several equivalent companions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the attack on Woodtown, Richard took down the exhausted soldiers and captives, and let the two stepping knights lead the two fast-moving beasts to send them back to the camp first. He led the team from Noland, and went all the way to Sir Huber’s territory, Sequoia Town. In the town of Sequoia, a real battle broke out. More than 30 guards and the guards of the jazz family fought in a desperate battle. They bleed, and they sacrificed, but they did not change the situation. Because of the existence of sand, they did not even cause serious injuries to even one enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Sequoia was conquered, and the family left by Sir Hu Bo became a hostage. A total of 28 guards died in battle, smearing a strong tragic color for Sequoia Town and earning the respect of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left Sequoia Town at the scheduled time, and there was no delay for even one minute. The guardian's desperate resistance is nothing but a time when the search for wealth is slightly cramped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one day, Richard almost swept a small half of the baron collar, arrested three captive knights, and killed a dying death. The Cavaliers also captured two of the main relatives of the dead jazz. A family member of a dead jazz was robbed and the baron was pretending to be invisible. The family of the three jazzes was robbed. If Fossa still turned a blind eye, his baronial title is almost coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after roaring all afternoon, the baron finally ordered the standing army to chase down the alien invaders. At dusk, five hundred soldiers, led by five captains, rushed to the town of Jovan to attack the invaders who were definitely not there. Fossa may not be smart enough, but he is not stupid, knowing that the number of troops and combat effectiveness are not equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the intruders is already very clear, they have at least fifteen strong players who are equivalent to the captains, and there is a magician close to the tenth level. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this rich Qihui continent, the magician is a lesser profession than the priest and the ritual, and each of the magicians who are close to the tenth level Respect, at least more respectful than his baron. The status of the magician comes not only from their strong lethality on the battlefield, but also because many equipment and items can only be achieved with their hands. For example, the magic array for various purposes, as well as the refining of magic equipment, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the magical status, power and wealth of the magician, there are many people who want to become magicians. However, the tradition of this plane is extremely important for the inheritance of the magician, and the requirements are extremely demanding. The time of the magicians is extremely precious. Most of the time is spent on the exploration and research of the magical world. Generally, a magician who reaches ten levels will only receive more than a dozen apprentices in his lifetime, and the extent to which the apprentices can eventually grow up. Anyone can't say it clearly. Therefore, all the great aristocrats who have the ability, including the royal family, will give the children of a little magical talent in their own family to the senior magician, occupying a few precious places. Those who are more gifted among the civilians, and most of them will not be able to enter the magical world for the rest of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, in this tradition, the magician is precious because of scarcity, because it is rare and scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually a powerful magician in the invaders! In the eyes of Baron Fossa, the threat of this magician has exceeded the sum of other invaders. There is a famous saying in this plane that only the magician can deal with the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this famous saying is a magician. Because of his identity as a great magician, this sentence becomes unquestionable. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in theory the sacred officer and the powerful comrades can also deal with the magician, but because of the lack of a large number of warfare to do the deduction, there is no effective general tactics. The accepted practice is to find ways to exhaust the magic of the magician and then kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron of Fossa can build a temple of the god of courage, but can not afford a ten-level magician. He asked the Earl of Galleon for help, because the Earl offered three magicians of level 10 or above. It is the most orthodox tactic to deal with the magician with a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extravagant study, the Baron Fossa is calculating the days. Five days later, the count’s reinforcements will arrive. If you are optimistic, the forward army will be able to reach the baron's territory two days later. At that time, Fossa was safe. Just thinking of the cost of asking for help, Fossa could not help but feel sad. The greed of the Earl of Galleon, famous for such a good opportunity, will certainly be blackmailed. The loss of the baron close to all the high-end combat power, the strength is at the lowest point, there is no room for bargaining. It is estimated that this time, the baron will lose at least five knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just land, taxes, and the people, it’s also the five powerful knights who are loyal to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know the results today, Fossa said that he would not provoke these invaders with 'insignificant' strength. In the gods, ‘insignificant’ has a definitive definition, which means that the level of the intruder generally does not exceed ten. But the losses caused by these ‘insignificant’ guys are already large enough to threaten the baronial title. Fossa had long regretted it. The more sensible way was not to encircle, but to provide some benefits and a road map to send these guys to the Duke of the Wolf. To take a step back, at least the guys in the temple should be the main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few days, Fossa had barely slept for a good day, and two dark blue eye bags had long been hung on the fleshy face. Through the window of the study, you can overlook the port city that is not far away. In the night, the lighthouse of the port and the temple of the god of courage are the most striking buildings. The temple of the Temple of Courage is built with a more magnificent torch tower than the port lighthouse. It will be lit when it receives a god or a major celebration. The brilliant fire is clearly visible dozens of kilometers away. Now because of the receipt of the gods, the torch tower of the temple has been ignited and will be extinguished after ten consecutive lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, looking at the magnificent temple, the baron suddenly felt that the jumping fire was very dazzling. He snorted heavily, pulled the curtains, and kept everything out of the window. Now the only prayer of Fossa is that the five hundred soldiers must not encounter the invaders. He is very clear about the results of both sides, and the violent esoteric invaders may be able to defeat the morale of these ordinary fighters with a wave of blows. The reason why you send troops at night is that there is a reason why you can't make a statement. That is, in order to break down, more soldiers can escape by the cover of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
