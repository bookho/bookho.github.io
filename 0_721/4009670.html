			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Ashan, Richard knew that his own Father is a real big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located in the Yuanwang Peninsula, Yashan has a population of more than 100,000. The city is built according to the shape of the peninsula. The northwest is the highest and extends southward to the Apennines. The islands with starfish, narrow strips of cities such as suffocating behemoths quietly lie between the water and the sky, the houses are neat, the streets are winding, and the 20-meter-high walls surround the city, protecting the city. Residents. On the vast plains outside the city, there are rich land everywhere. The wide Len River passes through the city and is injected into the Yaping Ninghai to provide an endless supply of water for the endless fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hill in the city of Yashan. The famous black rose castle is built on the top of the mountain. This is a majestic and huge building complex that can easily accommodate more than 3,000 warriors, the top of towers that stand tall in every corner, and even a permanent large-scale trebuchet, overlooking the city underfoot. However, since the completion of the Black Rose Castle, those trebuchets have never been used passively. Although there were enemy attacks on the city of Yashan, their footsteps touched the wall of Yashan at most, and then they were defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is a weapon of defense, and the Black Rose Castle is designed to the extreme. Looking at the complex fortress building with the Fort Fort as the core, you can always The wooden shooting platform that protrudes from the top of the city wall or the tower of the tower passes through the tunnel-like gate. It reaches a depth of ten meters and has a five-layered sturdy gate. There are many eyes that cannot be seen directly. Arrangement. When the Black Rose Castle was built, it claimed that only a thousand qualified soldiers were stationed. When the supply was sufficient, it was almost impossible to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many travellers have traveled to the city in various capacities. When they witnessed this monster that occupied the commanding heights of the city, they had to I agree that the Black Rose Castle designer is almost crazy about boasting. A noble military strategist who refused to be named was invited to enter the castle as a guest. After returning, he carried out a sand table deduction for the defense facilities he saw. The conclusion was that even if he used a full-fledged 50,000 army and heavy siege equipment, he wanted to capture the castle. It also has to pay a heavy price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she has never really stood the test of war, because the past owners of the castle don’t like defense, even if the force is absolutely inferior, they are more willing to choose The infinite plains or the deep mountains serve as backgrounds to eliminate enemies with sporting battles. And they will always win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the entire Holy Alliance, the madness of the Archimonde family is well known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to fight a madman, not to mention that there is always a genius in this crazy family. The Archer’s family had once been the biggest enemy. The Duke of Joseph on the Lennon peninsula once said with emotion that when the madman and the genius are combined, the damage that can be caused is multiplication and not added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sentence was said, the 20,000 main force of the Duke of Joseph was just defeated by Archimonde’s 10,000 elite in a long and brutal battle. There are less than two thousand people who have escaped. The power of His Majesty Joseph, Joseph, is not universal, and it is in the first ranks of the entire continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After centuries of development, members of the Archimonde family now include two marquis and seven counts, and the Viscount and the Baron are not much like dogs. It is not too much, and the territory it owns exceeds 100,000 square kilometers. The history of the Archimonde family is not long in the entire Holy Alliance, but its strength is definitely not weak and it is one of the most important forces. But what is peculiar is that if other families have so many aristocrats in the field, there should have been a duke, even a grandfather, but the Archimonde family has the highest but only the Marquis. To know that the Archimonde family is the most lacking is the force and the strong, they have powerful magicians, high-ranking warriors, more types of quirky high-level occupations, such as Dragon Warlock, Hellfire Knight Shadow sacrifices, etc. The mainland of Noland is not peaceful. It can even be said that the war is the norm. The Terran occupies less than half of the mainland and is fighting a large number of races to compete for living space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of human warfare may be no less than the devil. They not only fight against aliens, but also fight internally. The raging fire not only burned in Noland, but also spread to the depths of the ocean, as well as many planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a chaotic and complicated situation, it is not difficult for the Archimonde family with many talents to want to have a duke or even a founding father. As long as they concentrate resources to expand outward, get enough territory from the hands of the aliens, and firmly occupy the occupation, establish a complete civil, economic, and judicial system, and balance the distribution of interests within the family. For a maximum of two generations, a duke will produce. At least half of the Dukes of the Holy Alliance were created in this way, so in the eyes of the aristocrats of other countries, the Holy Alliance empire is the home of the nouveau riche and the country, and the Imperial Emperor is the largest nouveau riche. Only when something reaches a certain level will produce a qualitative change, as well as an outbreak. The outbreak of the Holy Alliance royal family exceeded the critical point of people's psychological endurance, so it won the respect and respect of the vast majority of the old aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund's outbreak is not inferior, but history is too short. The fatality of short history is that the accumulation of wealth and strength is not enough. And they are too crazy, so they didn't win respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current patriarch of Archimonde, the Marquis of Gordon, is itself an example of an outbreak. When he first started practicing 15 years ago, he was only a three-level rookie. Immediately demonstrated personal strength and political and military talents, the Elf Wang Ting, who captured the Everlasting Forest in ten years ago, shocked the entire Holy Alliance! There are many people who dare to attack the Elf territory, but only 50 members of the district and more than a thousand mixed soldiers dare to go deep into the night forest, but only one of Gotton, and he succeeded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, only thirty-three years old, Gordon has become a Marquis, and he has lived in the Black Rose Castle. The territory prepared for the patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In appreciating his population, Gordon’s experience is a legend, and the legend is still writing. However, the absolute influence of the Marquis of Gordon, except for the Black Rose Castle, is only the territory that he has laid. Other members of the Archimonde family simply ignore his orders. In Archimonde, the title of the patriarch is more like a simple honor, if there is no black rose castle and Ashan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heraldic and historian who specializes in the Akmon family pedigree once concluded that the reason why this family did not appear to be a grandfather is rooted in The independence and rebellion of the rogue in the family blood, every Archimonde is not willing to surrender to others, even if that person is his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a rigorous discussion. Scholars who make judgments are not well-known and have no reputation. In fact, if you can't rely on your research results to return to the aristocratic family of the Akron family, the scholar even has to live on the streets. If he really has the ability, he will not study the family that is so partial. The final result of the scholars is that they are living on the streets, and they are dying of illness and death. It is said that when his research results were sent to the head of the archbishop of Akmon at the time, the patriarch turned over and ordered that anyone in Archimonde be prohibited from giving him any form of financial support. And the Archimondes with a rebellious tradition, this surprisingly obediently executed the orders of the patriarchs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only real reason behind this is that this article is full of gorgeous words, despite the logic of confusion, the ridiculous case, full of catching shadows and naive speculation The conclusion is damn correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from Rutherland Village to Yashan is more than 3,000 kilometers, and it took less than half a month on the road. On the way, Modred told Richard about a lot of things about the Akmon family, and introduced some of the customs and forces on the mainland. So when I arrived in Ashan, Richard already knew a lot about the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
