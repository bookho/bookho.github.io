His heart was filled with noisy voices, so that his true heart was suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just want to take a look at the military camp..." Richard said to himself. Then I looked up and slammed a few big mouthfuls of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fire-like spirits, Richard looked at the bottle in his hand and couldn’t remember how it appeared in himself. In the hand. He does not have the habit of taking wine with him, nor will there be any in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the commander of the whole army, drinking in the military camp is not a good idea. Richard always pays attention to these details, so he wants to throw away the bottle, but when he thinks about it, he puts it in his arms and walks away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long knife extinction dragged on the ground, the scabbard jumped from time to time, sparking on the pebbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another camp, Gangde and Oral are working together to study the map. Halfway through, Gangde suddenly felt a little thirsty, so he touched it in his arms, but it was a glimpse. The bottle in the arms has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the blood-stained land is very cold, but the wind sometimes occasionally blows the heat that belongs to the day. Richard's gaze swept through the sentinels, horses, and bonfires, and then landed on a camp not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he still walked to the sands of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still a light in the camp, and the sand was still not sleeping. However, the figures cast on the wall are two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chading is on the spot, the noisy in my heart is gone for a moment, turned into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗, the curtain of the camp was pulled open, the sand was poured out, and he waved to Richard, and then the person in the account said: "Okay, first So. Go back first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The sound of the camp is really the voice of Iowa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart suddenly felt a bit of cold, and the hand unconsciously gripped the extinct handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel drilled out of the sands of the sands, smiled at Richard, and went to his camp. His smile is still perfect and brilliant, but in the eyes of Richard, it is rich in deep meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost pulled out the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forcibly controlled himself, walked into the sands of the camp, sat down, and focused his attention on the opposite wall. Just if I look at Io again, Richard will feel that there is nothing to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drifting sand turned around, put down the curtain, and then sat in front of Richard, looking at him with a smile. Then the sands found that Richard's expression was stiff, and his eyes were staring at the wall of a pair of camps, just like there was a fifth-order structure drawing. She snorted and laughed and reached for a few moments on Richard's line of sight before he caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Find me something?" Liusha always has a playful smile and stares at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing. Just patrol in the military camp." Richard said a little. With a mouth, he spurted a sip of alcohol. The sand slips more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tour patrol camp? That's not what you should do. What do you want to patrol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the face of such an explicit problem, Richard did not know how to answer. He made a strong calm and said: "I am the lord. Isn't the battalion of the military camp not the duty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is what Gangde and Oral should do. Even your big bats can do the job." Flowing sand said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a face, saying: "Yes, today your commander made several mistakes, and it is not very appropriate to fight on the spot."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns, he also knows that his command today is not the usual level, but just nodded and admitted, did not expect the sand to add a sentence: "This is what Iraq and Russia said."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hard body, but he has just nodded and admitted the mistake, but at the moment he can't repent. He took the frost and said coldly: "Islam, isn't he a fighting sect? Do you know how to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The battle gods of the Eternal Dragon Temple Need to study strategy and tactics." Liu Sha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt the gas rushing up and sneered and said: "The next one will let him command!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is also like this..." Sailing sand said half, looked at Richard's face and immediately stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly calmed down, his hands stroking the long knife to extinction, and faintly filling the sand with no exports: "Islam wants my command is What? What else does he want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand spit out his tongue and leaned over and said, "Okay! I just wanted to breathe you." In fact, this is the case. I told him that you were almost perfect in the command of the battle. Then I and I were reviewing today’s battle and felt that there are several areas for improvement. But I know that this is not your normal. Level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is still silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand sees something wrong, so he simply leans in his arms and stroking the face of Richard, saying: "Being a fighting officer, and commanding If the official tactics are well matched, they can really play their role. A wide range of gains or dispelling the magic, one minute and one minute later, the effect on the war situation is very different!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and reached for the head of the sloping sand, and the stiff body relaxed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, Io believes that your current personal strength is still too low, only the 12-level magician is not enough to shock his men." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Richard is hard. He almost blurted out: "It is not enough to shock a 12-level combat sect!" He took it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands didn’t seem to understand Richard’s reaction this time, pulled him up and kicked the extinction into the corner and said, “This Things are easy to solve! Come, I will teach you the sacred fighting techniques of the Eternal Dragon Temple now. This is very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the quicksand, Richard also knows the power of the eternal dragon temple sacred fighting technique. He has been taught in person many times before. However, he had not had time to continue to be awkward, and the sand suddenly came up. After a shock on Richard, Richard suddenly vacated and violently rolled in the air, then slammed his face down on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is pulled up again by Richard. This time, I will begin to explain in detail the techniques of decomposition and the skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time slipped away unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard didn’t know how much he was thrown down, his body was sore, and he walked away from the sands of the sand with a stiff footstep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a godsend, but also waved goodbye to Richard, which puts down the curtain. Richard went back with a chaotic and complicated mood until he walked into his own camp and remembered that there was one of the most important issues that had never been found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the relationship between Iraq and Russia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sand has not yet slept, she is holding a donkey, I don’t know what I am thinking, sometimes I smile. The light shone on her face, causing a circle of halo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You! In your future, but there is no me..." The sand is softly whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright military number awakened the soldiers from their sleep and the army quickly gathered. Richard went to war horses and saw Iraq and Russia far away. The fighting sergeant is still dazzling, looking back at Richard, the two eyes almost collided with sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a morning of no hurry, Richard’s troops appeared under the dusk castle. Flying at dusk castle is the flag of the Baron family of Fang Dan. The number of defenders on the wall is scarce. When the army of Richard is seen, the castle does not even have a gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, the people of Him really took it away." Richard smiled and said to the followers around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the Earl of Deer, stationed at the dusk castle, was evacuated overnight, carrying the body that Richard sent to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the station, Count Latour will inevitably push all blame on Sir Hogan’s head. After all, he fled without fighting. In fact, Hogan made the right decision. If it wasn't for his retreat, the thousand infantry would be left behind by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average of only one of the three thousand, and not fully prepared in advance, and in the rush to the exhausted soldiers, up to six hundred and nine The humanoid warrior is only a part of the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But politics doesn’t look at the problem like this, Odom is fighting and Hogan is not going to rescue. The more battle marks on Odom's body, the faster Hogan will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the purpose of Richard’s return of Odom’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the reconnaissance of elite bats, Richard has learned about Hogan’s style of warfare. This is the most annoying opponent of Richard. He would rather fight the enemy like Odom for ten games and would not like to play with Hogan. Even if the remaining strength of his hand is not high, if he relies on the fortifications of the dusk castle, it will inevitably cause damage to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
