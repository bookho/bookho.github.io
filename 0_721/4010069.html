			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first sight, when Richard saw the costumes of the two men, he could not help but Stayed for a while. Especially the cracks on the armor are simply unbelievable. The strength of the Holy Alliance Royal Family and the Iron and Blood Duke will not repair two sets of armor? They are definitely pro-sons, not a distant house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard took a closer look, the expression on his face became very exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the real crack, it is simply the artist's painting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of life and death, whoever believes that these two sets of armor are vulnerable, even want to take a knife and a leak at the crack, then Destined to tragedy. But if you look at it at first glance, it’s really not much that you can’t be fooled. Even Richard, who has real talent, discovered this shameless disguise only after careful attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the heavy armor, Nyris and Agamemnon’s weapons are radiant and gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris carries a huge sword with both hands, and the huge blade is about to catch up with his own height. The blade is bright red, translucent, like crystal. The blade is serrated for a while, and even if he does not provoke vindictiveness, a flame-like glow is constantly emerging, and the whole sword is condensed like a burning lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon’s weapon is a heavy hammer that is so large that it does not match the proportion of the body. It is covered with various barbs and has a hammer. The two groups of colorful lights are flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful magical power of the two weapons is completely unmaskable, and the quality is even better than the extinction on Richard's back. If the enchantment effect is not too strong, any camouflage will not be effective. Maybe these two weapons will be cracked or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon’s weapons and equipment are extremely luxurious and powerful, and they are so dead. The two horses that were specially selected were overwhelmed and had to change horses after a while. For a short period of time, the two of them changed six or seven times. The officer in charge of logistics turned his eyes straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, the rebellious emerald city appeared in Richard’s field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the Emerald City is not tall, less than ten meters, the whole body is made of logs, more for the defense of the beast, it is difficult to deal with the siege enemy. This is because the forest wild elves are good at hiding and climbing, and the high walls are not obstructive to them. It is only effective to rely on the power of the magic tower to find and kill them when they invade the defense zone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the magic tower's range, the army stopped and the formation gradually unfolded. Richard rode in the battle, staring at the enemies on the wall. Gradually, countless data began to emerge in the field of vision, and the entire battlefield began to enter Richard's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got some understanding of the battlefield, Richard suddenly felt that the body was sticky and somewhat uncomfortable, so he wiped it with a hand. The climate of this plane is extremely humid, and there is a faint mist of water over the entire forest. The sun in the air is dark and dull. It seems that even the sun is stained with green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are trees everywhere, all dew, all green. This is the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several collapsed gaps on the walls of the Emerald City, some of which were left behind by Gordon’s sweeping, and others are traces left by Lina when she attacked the city. So the city wall has no defensive effect, and now it is more used as the commanding height of the archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cavalry is on standby, the infantry and the archers begin to advance!" Richard finally ordered the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of armored infantry carrying a huge square shield, marching in a uniform pace, began to advance. The archer almost moved forward with the infantry and covered himself with a square shield. The Chinese army where Richard was located also slowly began to move forward, and one hundred cavalry were in the rear, waiting for further orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel archer began to shoot, and some of the messy arrows rained down and failed to inflict much damage on the defensive enemy. The infantry and archers continue to approach forward until they enter their own range. With a command, all the archers open their bows together! The volley of more than 400 archers constitutes a wave of horrible arrows, all concentrated on a small isolated wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen archers and infantry on this wall, and they are dozens of times more than the archers who have set fire, and suddenly suffered heavy casualties! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longbowmen once again opened the bow, and it was a wave of intensive arrows, emptying a section of the wall again. The rebels were obviously a little scared, and the arrows that hit back were suddenly sparse. Archimonde's longbows used all the heavy and sharp armored arrows, and with the power of the projectile, the power was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard first ordered a fire to shoot and emptied another wall, within the longbow’s range, there were no rebels on the wall. . In fact, the number of enemies killed in the three sets of fires is less than one hundred. Although the coverage of the arrow rain is not large, once it is covered, the effect of almost death has actually survived the rebels. No one wants to be exposed to the arrow rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard let the whole army continue to advance, and the Chinese army also slowly followed suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When advancing to less than two hundred meters from the city wall, Richard knew that he was about to enter the magic tower's attack range. So ordered the whole army to be dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a thousand fighters are divided into dozens of small-scale teams, which are at least 20 meters apart from each other and then continue to advance into the city. For a time, the most intensive battlefield and the largest team was the Chinese army where Richard was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Emerald City, the rebel leader, General Ender’s eyebrows suddenly locked, and there was a slight hunch in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when the battle progressed, Lina had already flew into the air to show her power, and the flying dragon would also pour into the flames from the air. The role of ordinary warriors in this battle is only slightly stronger than the embellishment. The fighters on both sides are basically fighting on their own, they don't want to, and they are unable to intervene in the duel between Ender and Lina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what End needs to do is to hang around Lina with the help of the demon field, threatening her at all times, so that she can’t let go of her attack magic. tower. Then the spare magic tower can be switched into an attack state in time according to the situation. The army with magic-assisted attack is completely different, and those elite Archimonde fighters will suffer heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the eyes of such strong guys as Lina and Ender, the battle between ordinary warriors is only an embellishment of war, but after all, it is an elite warrior, and the casualties are More, Lina will also feel bad. Then have to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time is completely different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
