Soon, all the seats in the temple were filled, and even the temporary seats were not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many giants have come to more than one person, not only the elders and heirs, but even the patriarchs of the branch family have arrived. The royal family is even more exaggerated. In one breath, four emperors and two empresses, as well as more than ten royal families, both large and small, hold the clan in a certain area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s Majesty did not appear in person, but the courtiers around him were present, indicating that his eyes were watching. The Eternal Dragon Hall also came with two great priests and a deputy head of the Knights. Anyone who truly understands the inside story of the Dragon Hall knows that this deputy head is actually the guardian of the Vatican. In other words, the eyes of the great priest are also watching here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are so many people coming, all the guards and attendants, and even those who are in a bad position, have to give up their seats and retreat to the door of the temple. wait for news. Vonster also almost lost his seat, but fortunately his identity as a builder allowed him to receive some preferential treatment, standing on the side of Luno. This made him even more hateful about Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:10, Richard appeared on stage on time. He omitted the lengthy guest sets and speeches, but bluntly announced the start of the conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr., ladies! This is a temporary assembly conference, and it is only a third-order non-standard installation. Here, I need to reiterate that this structure already has a master, so it will not be sold. Then let me show this structure to everyone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the magical video device and magnified a framed image onto the stage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unusually sophisticated and complex structure, and many real powerhouses will feel a fierce atmosphere when they first see it, and even some people They can't breathe! They immediately realize that this is a soul-like structure!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no description on this structure, no name, magic The image is only faithfully presented in the original form of the structure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of people, if there is no magical skill, even the most familiar structure It is impossible to distinguish those complicated magical arrays. Only a handful of truly powerful and powerful people will faintly guess some functions of the structure through keen perception.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the front of this frame is different, just the magical image will convey a burst of fierce temperament.<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has the structure of the soul! It is the trait of some special features of the fourth grade or above, people are excited. If a third-level structure has such qualities, it means The extraordinary special ability beyond imagination also means lower carrying capacity and grade requirements. Such a structure can already be regarded as a fourth-order structure, and it is more than enough to support a conference.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when people held their breath and waited for Richard to announce the name and purpose of the installation, the face of the royal architect Lu Nuo was suddenly defeated, gloomy as dead, hands more It was uncontrollably trembling. Vonster noticed this scene, and it was naturally shocking, because the most important thing for the builder is the control, which is a pair of stable hands. Fengster’s heart suddenly has a very uneasy feeling, which is rapidly Breeding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This structure is called 'life is extinct'." Richard's voice was as dull as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the silent audience suddenly exploded, and the exclamation, discussion and roaring gathered into a huge sound, no worse than the roar of the two-headed ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several strong people who stand up in disregard of the image and scream: "Is it really life? Can the superimposed life be lost?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For almost every strong player with sufficient carrying capacity, life is an artifact that can be met and not available. And because it's more difficult to make than most of the fourth-order structure, it has the ability to be superimposed, so no matter how many lives are there, it will be swept away. In history, life has never been designed by a madman since it was designed by a madman. It has hardly appeared in any auctions. Before any life was released, it was already strong. The person has been divided up in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a third-order construct, the value of life is on top of many fourth-order constructs. And those who are strong, as long as they get a life, will be more eager to get a second or even more life. If the life is such a ruin, the value can no longer be measured by gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the life of a finished product is so in front of their eyes, how can they not be excited? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the first line of reason, there’s even someone who is tempted to grab it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard, standing on the stage, is so special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of life is so dazzling that even the magic rides that Richard later showed were not of interest. Richard set the price of the magic ride at 100,000 gold coins, and then presented it to the royal family on the spot. The other four randomly placed four people from the VIPs present and said that they were given a trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Richard was intentional or unintentional, and the Joseph family actually got a magic ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then announced that the magic ride accepted the reservation and ended the dressing conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the press conference, the flow of people immediately rushed to Richard, and there was a great desire to devour him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was also taken aback. He thought that the release of life would definitely cause a sensation, but he did not expect it to be sensational. If he knew in advance that this is a structure that only the holy builder can guarantee the success rate, even the sacred dynasty and the royal master of the millennial empire can only rely on a lot of trials and unparalleled luck to harvest a complete Products, may consider other ways to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the eyes of a strong man, Richard couldn’t help but be afraid, regretting that this release was a bit too sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are still many familiar people at the press conference, such as the three great figures of the Eternal Dragon Hall, Nyris and Agamemnon are also present. This allowed Richard to let go. In this case, the original Fasqi is not to be absent, she is a good bodyguard after all. Unfortunately, because of the seven suits, Faschi hid himself like an ostrich, and obviously stayed on the floating island, but said nothing to see Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the unique singer of the emperor’s courtiers sounded: “Mr. Richard, I want you to go see him now.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the noisy sounds, the voice of the courtiers made everyone heard clearly, so the people who were excited were calmed down a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Richard to answer, the soft voice of Nolan’s great singer rang again: “Lee, after seeing you, find a time to come to an eternal dragon. In the temple, there are some things that Vatican’s great priests want to confess.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are royal and eternal dragon halls, those who want to secretly attack the idea of ​​nature For the time being, I have died down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodthirsty Philip is certainly fearful, and the eternal dragon temple that has been deeply rooted in the system of divine alliance power is even more insurmountable. The behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the great priest Varian, who controls the power of time, has the power to look back, and any conspiracy will be invisible in front of her. It is only that the Eternal Dragon Temple has always participated in the secular political struggle, so the influence of Vatican does not seem to be particularly large. But this time since Nolan has made it clear that Vatican is looking for Richard, then before Richard sees Vatican smoothly, if there is something wrong in the middle, then face Vatican’s anger. The ability to lose sacrifices is tantamount to losing the future for most nobles. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the strong minds calm down, they naturally realize that strong rush is only the best policy, and trading is the best way. And the structure is also damaged, this kind of special structure, except the producer himself, can hardly find a second person to repair. So everyone began to think about what method to use to get a life from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already at noon, and Philip’s meeting with Richard’s location naturally chose the restaurant, and Richard also had lunch with the Emperor for the first time. Glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting at the table, Richard realized that it was not just glory, it was a very affordable thing. There are a lot of things on Philip's table that are not bought with money. The parts of the various dragons are the ingredients of the main dish, and even with Richard's insights from the deep blue, there are many things unheard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s barbecue, fruit, dessert or red wine, the strong power will burn like a fire in Richard’s body, then it will be raging Energy is delivered throughout the body. This feeling of fullness of power, Richard has not experienced for a long time, second only to eating recipes that Su Hailun specially prepared for him in dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Philip did not show his amazing speed of eating, but told the courtier to distribute as much food as possible to Richard’s plate. Forcing Richard to speed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the amazing food that Richard gradually showed, Philip nodded with satisfaction and said, "The song boy’s boy is very good. There is a future. Your teacher is Su Hailun? Hey, the last time I saw her, it was more than a decade ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard has no Nyre The kind of stunt that eats and talks correctly, swallows the mouthful of food, puts down the knife and fork, just want to say something. Philip waved and said: "Nothing, you continue to eat, I am just older, I like to talk to myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, sure enough Philip is talking about the past when he was young. There are Vatican in the story, there are Gotton, and there are some names that Richard is familiar with, such as the Duke of Mensa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened while eating desperately. He didn't want to work hard. The waiter's white face was full of smiles and he was paying attention to him. The speed of delivering food to his plate was just right, just in the limit that Richard could hardly bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
