			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard is doing the deepest meditation in his room, and The barbaric massacre has never been sheathed, and it is placed within reach. He also has the power to make a full blow. As long as the knife is still there, it must not be contemptuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of Richard’s body, the Elven world tree appears to be languid, and the leaves are entwined with layers of delicate blue light, and Archimonde’s blood is not Roaring again, but slowly flowing, and occasionally picking up some waves, the poison is still eating away his magic, and now the magic of Richard has dropped to the level of 12, but the toxicity has not been suppressed, Li Only by meditation to supplement the magic, while trying to suppress the toxicity, in his pocket, the fate crystal plate is still there, but Richard does not know whether it is time to use this last crystal plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep blue meditation space, the first star that releases the star power is still floating in the air, and the other is the blood color that is condensed by the broken plane. The planets are shaking in uneasiness, and sometimes they will spit out a bloody force. Most of the power returns to itself, but occasionally there will be a piece of surface power that will overflow and be absorbed by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the power of the two planets and the resilience of the wells of the stars, Richard will have a lot of magic to poison the poison, but this long time has passed, The toxicity of the poison is not reduced at all. Even Richard has never heard of such a powerful poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously stroked the fate of the crystal plate, this crystal plate does not know what material is made, gentle and soft, but extra strong, it looks Going up and the first two crystal plates are no different, but they are much harder. The first two pieces of fate crystal plate give people the feeling that they are broken when they touch, and this crystal plate actually makes Richard think that there is no break. The crystal plate slowly turned a little bit of life, and suddenly let Richard ponder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard once again entered the dark blue meditation world, re-observing his blood talent status, the five elf world trees are very wilting, but contrasting each other, but It is the tree of life that seems to be the most tenacious. In the blood of Richard's elves, perhaps the most unappreciated is the tree of life. Richard has never intended to be transferred to be a priest. Naturally, this talent-based treatment will not Pay attention to it, but under the erosion of poisonousness, the tree of life is actually so tenacious. If you look closely, you can see that there are sparse rays that are floating around the tree of life. These rays are very different, they are entwined. The poisonous blue on the blue, and the poisonous Ying eroded each other, and then died together. Every light can consume dozens of times more than the poison, but the number of them is too small, so the function is not obvious, but Once the light disappears, it will give birth to a new light from the tree of life, so the number of light spots has not changed, that is, it will not be less, and it cannot be increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard immediately observed it with his heart. Only then did he discover that the light contained the rules he had learned from the tree of life of Green Forest, but the amount he realized at that time was not many, so the amount of light at that moment was not enough, and the power was not strong enough. However, only the effects that have been seen so far have made Richard happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the original rules is so powerful, it is no wonder that those who touch the rules cannot be measured by level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will immediately realize that the rules of life have been revisited in consciousness, and then no longer convert the collected stars into magic, but all into The power of life is injected into the tree of life world, and it is consciously poured. The tree of life is shaken, and several rays of life fly from the swaying branches and leaves, and the ray of life shines. The number of rays of life increases directly. It has doubled, although it is still negligible relative to the huge amount of poisonous, but Richard has seen hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, under the constant power of attention, the tree of life world vibrates again, shaking off the light of life at three points, Richard silently calculates, at this speed Next, by the end of the day after the decisive battle, the toxicity should have been suppressed, and there will be a magic level of about ten at the time. This magical force can drive the magical arm. For Richard, this is enough, he still You can fight with dignity and keep the final knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has a multi-pronged approach, only retaining the third consciousness responsible for the power of the tree of life, and the second consciousness is fully capturing the miter of the migration, and then transforming For the power of life, the main consciousness is fully committed to the analysis of the rules of the Green Forest Tree of Life. Before the final battle, even if only one rule is resolved, the vitality can be more than a few points. In the middle of the night, the elders came to the residence of the holy tree dynasty and secretly visited the Chinese Archbishop. After a moment, the elders left on their own, their faces were very ugly, and the Chinese sent them. The elders arrived at the gate of the station. At present, he is far away, and his face is also cloudy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong." Six emperors appeared from the shadows and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These barbarians, who did things but did not do it thoroughly, are not weird." The Archbishop of China spoke slyly, but did not With a little explanation, I walked into my room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the figure of the Chinese bishop disappeared, the Nine Emperor also appeared from the shadows and made a face to the direction of the Chinese Bishop, and then asked: "What happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six emperors smiled lightly and said: "I guess there will be a slap in the ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nine Emperor screamed and said: "The Barbarian Presbyterian Church Didn't the two strongest fighters have been banned from playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Six Emperors said with a vague arrogance: "If only a few guys, to me How to say it is a hard fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is in the middle Poisonous guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poisoned guy, who is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six princes I ignored her questioning and walked to my room. The nine emperors were so angry that they went back to sleep with hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the middle of the moon, there are nearly 30 points of light around the tree of life in Richard’s life. It seems to be small and scale, and often can be The blue-and-white clear light in the small piece is progressing faster than what Richard expected, and the progress of analyzing the rules of the life tree is also very smooth. On the eve of the decisive battle, a new rule should be resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s door suddenly sounded, and Richard was slightly surprised, then got up and lifted the knife, and then opened the door. Standing outside the door is the Uzzara Grand Mosque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be a great sacrifice, please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee passed the Great Sacrifice Inside the house, however, just look at him and wait for the instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzzarazu took out two vials of black jade and placed them in front of Richard, saying: "Richard, you took some things yesterday, Unfortunately, we don't have the antidote of that thing right now, so in order to make up for you, here are two bottles of holy herbs collected from the snow mountain. One bottle is a beast remedy that can greatly enhance your body strength. I see you in battle. The proportion of using magic is not much, so the body remedy that strengthens the body strength can make up for the loss of your power due to the damage of the magic. In addition, this bottle is wild and bloodthirsty, it can stimulate your body in the shortest time. Potential, so that your combat power is greatly improved, of course, its consequences will be excessive overdraft physical strength, after the war will enter extreme fatigue and weakness, the length of the wild bloodthirsty effect, and how long the post-war fatigue period depends on How strong is your body's ability to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
