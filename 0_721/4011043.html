			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A southern duke said with a smile: "Your army is powerful! Send 40,000 to go to the black rose castle, then I will escape a thousand! You are a 300,000-strong army! From the beginning to the end, there are no more than 50,000 troops used by Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough!!" The emperor slammed the table and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet members have stopped a new round of quarrels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever wants to doubt the strength of Richard, then go find him to fight, war or single-handedly, you can go! Go! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the emperor's mouth is sprayed on the faces of the Dukes of the North. The dukes were all in vain, and they did not expect why the emperor suddenly became so angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the emperor threw a new document on the table and said with a gloomy face: "Let's have a look!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke and the ministers circulated one by one, and everyone was bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor said with a sneer at this moment: "Do you think people will be afraid of war? Do you know now?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is the ultimatum sent by the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter says that it has been a week, and if the Holy Tree Dynasty can’t make a final decision within three days, Richard will start a war and come by himself. 'take' the territory that deserves. And the letter also added one, because Richard is fighting on the territory that ‘self’ deserves, so he no longer protects the security of the lords and the right to pay ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a blatant threat and is threatened by the lords of the lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference hall was silent for a while, and after a while the military minister said: "If the Shining Church does not play, we may not win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the power of the dynasty, you can't win a small lord?!" The duke in the north picked up again. This time his territory will be divided by more than half by Richard, so the opposition is particularly energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he was half-finished, he was suddenly blocked from his throat. He bowed his head and looked incredulously at the short sword inserted in his heart. The style of the dagger is incomparably gorgeous and is in the hands of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s face was a little embarrassed, and the short sword suddenly twisted and twisted, completely smashing the heart of the duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, from now on, you are no longer the lord of the sacred dynasty. The power of the dynasty has nothing to do with you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of the emperor, the duke’s eyes were protruding and I wanted to say something, but all the blood in my mouth was blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, is there any objection?" The emperor calmly asked the Dukes of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of Richard’s harvesting of the territory was as smooth as expected, except for a few days of delay in the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the action of the superpowers to define their sphere of influence, and it is also the practice of Noland, except that the former superpowers are mostly in their own country. Enclosure, and Richard's plan includes not only the three empires, but also a long stretch of coastline from the polar continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As judged by Richard, there is no other option for the lords to accept his practice. The war between the Black Rose Castle and the Holy Tree Dynasty was the final turning point. Since then, no one is willing to take the initiative to provoke the war to Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard does not have a thousand rides, but the various arms from the mother's nest are endless, and the underarms have experienced and harvested The brutal battle of the people, each strength soared. In contrast, perhaps the most common thing is Richard, and Richard is only one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 25 Master, on the surface does not look much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s just superficial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After defeating the undecided Queen, Richard has faintly become the first lineup of the super strong. Only a few stubborn old guys will question the identity and strength of Richard's superpowers by rank and past standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is still doing nothing, and most of his time in Noland is in a daze, occasionally going to his private plane to take a circle and killing a few unopened monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, he only completed a fifth-order configuration, or a water-filled structure with a very strange function. This structure is mainly used for non-marine races when exploring underwater. It can give the user a powerful ability to manipulate water elements at startup. Even if you fight the sea beast in the deep sea, it will not be too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a structure, the function is so wonderful, it is also a holy structure. However, Richard immediately threw it into the point redemption system, but did not expect it to stir up a small wave. Because of its unique function and low requirements on carrying capacity, it has made the strong people interested. In many planes, underwater is a place where people are discouraged. But the ocean is a resource-rich world wherever it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of Fu Shide are still looking forward to a grand launch conference, because Richard’s sacred construction of the points system is too much There are dozens of types. If you come to a centralized conference, its grand event will be unprecedented. But now Richard has no interest in these. He just strolls at his own pace or is in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only moveable discussion is that Archimonde sent a legend and a dozen sanctuaries to the extremist battlefield. However, this force did not go to the newly-destroyed regiment fortress, but it was kept in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strong men of Archimonde did not play, the marshals of the day and night are still very welcome. After all, every legendary powerhouse is a considerable force, and Archimonde's legend is notoriously strong and equipped with luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, time passes quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months later, the fleet on the ice floe was finally completely remodeled, so Richard set off to dark blue. After reviewing the fleet, they are ready to go to the green continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emissary of the Millennium Empire came from the covenant, and the team was led by the Goshawk, but what surprised Richard was that the deputy leader was actually Mina. In the eyes of Richard, such a weak and unsanterable little sanctuary, ran to the vast green continent, purely looking for uncomfortable. Richard does not think how peaceful this trip will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s road map to the Abyss abyss is inevitable, but the high elves are famous for their arrogance and arrogance. They are driven out of Noland by human beings, and naturally they hate people very deeply. When Richard arrived in the green continent, it is estimated that not immediately starting to play is a very good result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk is naturally a very useful partner, and even Richard acknowledges that a senior scholar’s ​​mage will indeed play a great role if used in the right place. The role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also out of this, Richard left Raymond in the first place and had a series of changes. However, fate can't be speculated after all. If it is not the soul provided by Raymond, the mother's nest can't resist the call of the Reaper, and it has long become a weapon to deal with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations for the long-range fleet are gradually getting ready, just before the day when Richard is ready to leave, there is an unexpected news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Heitings was defeated under the black eddy fortress. All the soldiers were almost killed and he himself was seriously injured. Although the life has been saved by salvation, the damage suffered is permanent, and I am afraid that it is impossible to return to the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This campaign, when the battle started, suddenly tens of thousands of devil fish emerged from the black vortex fortress! Although they only have 16 levels of strength, the number is several times that of the Heatings army! Moreover, Heitings is not very good at command, and can't issue instructions through the soul link like Richard, so the command efficiency is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, although the Devil Fish Force was completely smashed and a large number of Dax Sodas were killed, they could not escape the fate of the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he heard the news, Richard sighed incomprehensibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heitings’s army is indeed very strong, and all the way to the end of the battle, if you do not consider the means to obtain the source of the army, only the actual results On the other hand, it can be said that it is a major contribution to Noland. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Dax Sodas won, but the regional strength was greatly hurt, the elite troops lost almost half of the total, and the military fortress also lost four. At least in the next few decades, Dakosodas will be at a disadvantage in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Heitings finally chose to fight against the Dakosodas, instead of using his soul-filled army in Noland’s civil war, Richard decided to still think about it and temporarily let him go. , observe for a while and then say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of departure is coming soon. With a long magical whistle, seven modified giant warships are sailed out of the port and headed far away. The green continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven warships have now undergone major modifications, almost completely not the same. Buildings with different styles and Norland styles appear on the ship. They are dense but have a strange sense of coordination. If you have seen the War of Faro, you will find the construction techniques and the style of the Reaper. The exception is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the seven giant ships whirls from time to time, and the color is different. They correspond to the colors of the seven-wheeled crescent moon. And Richard stood on the pale blue ship. This warship with the blue moon and the moon as extra energy was set as the flagship by Richard to remember the sword that Ilani speared to Gordon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bridge of the greatness, the ice floes and the deep blue are far behind Li, and the front is the endless sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you have seen the magnificence of the void, the endless sea in front of you will still feel your own smallness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood against the sea breeze and played the last piece of fate in his hand. This crystal plate has never left, and in recent years, as Richard's strength has steadily increased, the chances of using it have become less and less. In many cases, Richard can't remember to use it, even when he has a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long as this fate is still on the body, Richard will feel inexplicable peace of mind, after all, even at the last minute, he always has a retreat . Hopeful and hopeless are completely different moods, even if you hope again, that is hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war with the Reaper, this fate crystal plate blocked the high-energy beam of the reaper more than once, and even once gave a metal kinetic energy to Bounced back. So now Richard is more of a lucky charm. When the fingertips touched the lucky crystal plate, Richard would feel his heart calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
