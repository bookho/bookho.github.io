			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of destiny is like a heavy mountain, pressed against Richard’s heart, Let him never smile again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original joy of Clark's joining to bring strength is also diluted by the heavy fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Richard’s fate for the future is only likely to be resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still very young and has achieved great success. At his age, even if he looks at the entire continent, not many people can do more than him. it is good. So even if he fell into the seemingly desperate environment of the Faro plane, he quickly cheered up and tried to get closer to a qualified leader. It can be said that even in his lifetime, even if he knew the fate of himself and the shadow creature, Richard was not so heavy and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images that have not been captured also make Richard suspicious, not knowing what kind of fate is recorded above. This kind of foreseeable future is only a glimpse of the feeling, it is really bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light falls on the large desk where the map is placed, and the afterglow can only take into account the square of the table. The moonlight coming in through the window is the second light source, so the whole room is shrouded in deep, dark gray blocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat quietly, his back pulling incoherent lines on the wall behind him. He is now eager to become powerful quickly, thinking about it. It seems that the most effective way is to sacrifice to the Eternal and Time Dragon to exchange powerful power. At the same time, the hen's nest is also a weapon of war, and it can now completely reverse the outcome of a partial battle. To make your mother's nest strong, you need to constantly invest in magic crystals, divine objects, and food. In other words, the strength of the mother's nest is made up of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of sacrifices or gold coins, war is always the fastest way to get them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination is gone, and the rest of the things will be easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and said to the flowing sand: "Can you tell me about the eternal and the dragon of time? It is best to know the types you know." Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands have come back from their own thoughts and nodded, saying: "The eternal and the dragon of time has almost infinitely many gods. Kindly, the gods that each person faces are likely to be different, because its will will adjust God's gift according to the condition of the sacrificer, but it can still be divided into time, artifact, ability, field and other major categories. Although the Eternal and Time Dragon will adjust the God's gift according to what the sacrificer needs most, it will give a certain range, and the specific God grant will be randomly selected from these ranges. This actually reflects the lucky law, that is, luck is also strength. Part of it. Good luck guys always get what they want, and bad luck guys need a lot of sacrifices, depending on the number of sacrifices to increase the probability of getting hope. Now, I can only tell you something. God knows that God of Time is always seen The most precious, because every life will instinctively hope for eternal life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal and timeless dragons have many kinds of gods, just knowing the sand There are hundreds of them, just a brief introduction, the carriage of time unwittingly reached the dividing line of midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening, Richard analyzes how to combine these gods to be able to play the most important role. Of course, at this time, he intentionally or unintentionally ignored the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sands say, the law of fortune is one of the supreme rules above all planes. The eternal and time dragons are demanding on the sacrifices. To get enough sacrifices depends on fate to a large extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to the last kind of God's gift, Richard grabbed the head of the sloping sand with his hand and laughed and said, "Okay, go to sleep! It’s too late, we have to raise our spirits, and we have to fight again tomorrow!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand smashed and snorted and said: “Laughter is true. False! Don't laugh if you don't want to laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn't ask why Richard suddenly became heavy. If Richard doesn't want to say it, then she won't ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men undressed, went to bed, hugged, but did not move any further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the ceiling quietly, thinking nothing, just lying down. The flowing sand is in his arms, listening to his heartbeat, and his heart is blank, just a little bit sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night without sleep, and two young girls seem to have grown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, when the sun came in through the window, the sand broke up and slammed Richard and said, "Hey! Lazy, get up." Today, I still want to fight, let's talk, who are we going to grab?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of energetic sand, Richard is not in a hurry to get up, Dressed, then suddenly took her over, staring at her eyes, then gently kissed her lips, and then forced her face, said: "You laugh too well!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wool out, the sand immediately returns to his room to take equipment, view the scrolls, preparations before the battle. And Richard stood in the morning light for a long time, looking down on the chaotic but vibrant blue water oasis, meditation, but did not rush to convene the troops to set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War is a double-edged sword that destroys the enemy and may hurt yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcano in the heart is already on the verge of eruption, but Richard is not in a hurry to act. Instead, after standing for more than half an hour, he simply returned to the room and thought quietly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the captured image is the future and you want to participate in it, then you should be more cautious and calmer now. The long river of destiny is one of the supreme rules, whistling through time and space, no matter what the reason is to see its instant, but it is only the possibility of fate, not necessarily. Because the fate of the river is not a single torrent, but the past, present and future of numerous trajectories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current strength, even a little water droplets can’t be called. That is to say, if he is not cautious, he will die before the incident of the picture appears, the moment of fate will still come, and he will lose the qualification to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that the environment in front of him seemed to be in danger. Although his team had achieved many miraculous achievements, they all danced on the tip of the knife. Every time the situation is weak and strong, it is not what he is willing to choose, but it is a last resort. Moreover, there is always a ceiling for weak wins. Once you encounter any Sanctuary in the Faro plane, it is dangerous. Even if you can use your number to pile up your opponents, you have to pay a heavy price. So even if one step is wrong, this team with unlimited future prospects may die halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
