At this time, Richard did not rush to start, but looked at it calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of dragons around the plane portal are on alert, the sky is having a dragon hovering back and forth, and in the camp not far away, The other dragon is rallying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled at the blue-black dragon in the sky and said, "See you again, this time you see nothing from the prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was the first prophecy dragon that ambushed Richard, and it seemed agitated at the moment. When he saw Richard, he immediately roared angrily: It’s you, this time you’ve moved away from the plane portal, and I see how you run away.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha calmly took the ruling behind him and said: Who said that I want to run, it is you, don’t escape for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophecy suddenly stared at the ruling in the hands of Richard Two jets of mist with fire were sprayed from the nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the dragon that fluttered from the sky was also eyeing Richard. It was dark brown in color and prophetic. The dragon has to be doubled and the appearance is much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brown Dragon Dragon’s earth-shattering dragonfly, with its wings, has already transported the dragon’s flying ability, and its speed has soared. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dragon is predicted to be a dragon, but it is desperately exclaiming: "Copper scales, escape, escape."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t know what kind of frightened it was. After smashing it, it turned around and ran. In the blink of an eye, it reached full speed. The posture completely ignored the other, and even dared not look back. A glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon named Copper Scale was shocked, but then stared at Richard again, his eyes immediately turned from dissatisfaction and disdain, shouting: "The guy who is not daring." This sentence does not know whether it is in the Licha or in the prophecy of the dragon, and then the copper scales continue to accelerate toward Richard, far away is a breath of dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's spurt is a brown mist with a strong metallic rust. This is a rare metal corrosion dragon. It is much more arrogant than the green dragon's poisonous corrosion, and it is a heavy armor. Even if the legal person does not wear metal armor, the corrosion degree of the dragon's interest is still not **, and a strong person is sprayed in front, and it will become a skeleton in a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dragon scale of the copper scale just contains a lot of metal, but it is in the middle of the investigation, such a dragon can not hurt the king of the metal Check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li’s eyes, the ruling flashed to the copper scales, and the copper scales immediately flashed a layer of dark red light. The fate ruling has been launched. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper scale suddenly felt uncomfortable in the whole body, and the skin suddenly became extremely sensitive. It still didn’t understand what happened, and the dragon eye suddenly smashed. Big, I saw that Richard went straight through its dragon's breath and appeared in front of it like electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is now a master of fighting art, flashing in front of the copper scales, attracting the attention of the dragon, the dragon faucet is shrinking, To bite down, the dragon moves, and Richard has flashed to the bottom of the behemoth. After the verdict, it is inserted into its chest until it is not handled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper scale suddenly gave a painful embarrassment, and in the air, a mess of chaos, finally forced Richard to open, it looked down at his wounds, I really don't understand how the dragon scales that are known for their defenses can't stop Richard's hand. This knife is very deep, but the copper scales are huge, so the injury is not too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the ruling and shook his head. After all, he knew almost nothing about the rules of the dragon plane. The fate ruling only played the most. The basic effect is to weaken the defense of the copper scale by two levels, but the copper scale is a rough-thick melee-type dragon. The defense is naturally higher than the other dragons. After weakening the two levels, it also has considerable In the defense of the Green Dragon, even if the ruling of the ruling has fallen into its dragon body, but it is suppressed by the defensive power of the copper scale, many special effects can not be played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly handed the ruling to his left hand and pulled back the moonlight from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the copper scale suddenly felt inexplicable and aversion to cold, and it immediately spurted a few bites of breath to Richard. Unfortunately, this time Richard is again Directly passing through its dragon's breath, the dragon can't lock the opponent's real position at all. The dragon finally sees it. When Richard crosses, there is a channel suddenly appearing in the dragon's breath, just letting Richard pass. The corrosive effect of the dragon's breath, but even Richard's clothes are not stained, contains a lot of metal composition of the dragon's breath, just to be restrained by Richard's metal king, if Richard is willing, even let these dragons turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's figure flashed a few flashes, suddenly appeared on the back of the dragon, double-knife spin, then fell down, forced down, two long knives did not enter the back of the copper scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee double-knife pushed straight to the end, stopped for a while, then pulled out, then a random transmission, flashing to a hundred meters away. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper scales are in the air, and after a long time, a terrible pain is heard, and the back of the blood is flying high, and it is sprayed to a height of more than ten meters. It is like pulling out a blood flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this smile, the legendary Feng Nai can not be this dragon, but the moonlight's ultimate sharp is not the same, the moonlight is completely broken, then immediately All the horror effects of life and everything, and all the horror effects, broke out, and the dragon that was nearly 100 meters long from beginning to end was hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha figure flashed away, in front of the copper scales, facing the dragon claws slammed, the left hand decided to go up, slightly blocked Blocking the dragon claws, the right hand moonlight sweeping, a water-like brilliance flashed, the dragon's front paws immediately opened a horrible wound, and even the keel left a deep nick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bruises of the copper scale have not disappeared, and Richard appears on the other side of his body again. The double knife opens another blood hole in its ribs. This time, when the effect of life was bursting out, Richard did not dodge. The dragon blood that was sprayed out had a face, but he opened his mouth and blew a blue line of fire, directly from the wound into the copper scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha flashed a hundred meters away and looked at the copper scales quietly. The dragon struggled in pain in midair, but still stopped Can't fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has several horrible wounds on it, and after being ruined by life, it is completely a vaguely deep pit, but these wounds are resilience The famous dragon is just a serious injury. The real fatality is actually the smashing of the smoldering energy that Richard blows into it. This sighs into the body and immediately begins to rush to the softest place, and the copper scale is large. Some of the internal organs burned to ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon finally fell heavily on the ground, the huge dragon body rolled a few laps, overwhelming the formation of the dragons, the copper scales struggled several times To get up, but after repeated falls, just lift the faucet barely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks to predict the direction in which the dragon flees, and the dragon's eyes are flashing, and now it is clear that the damn prophecy dragon must have seen something. This is desperate to escape, and maybe it also includes its own ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon thought of things, in fact, Richard also realized, but he just shrugged, prophecy has always had a biggest problem, because the prophet is so weak, after all, not everyone has the courage to challenge the fate, I did not expect the dragon also have this Wrong, otherwise predicting that the dragon and the copper scales will join hands, how can it not let Richard win so easily, even if the prophecy is expected to stay a few seconds, remind the copper scale, let it be careful of the fate of Richard's fate, the battle will be very different However, it is another scene. Richard may open the copper scales, first solve the prophecy dragon, and then go back to the bronze scales. Perhaps it is because of this scene that the dragon will be killed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper scale suddenly raised the faucet and gave a very unwilling roar. Then the huge head fell heavily and slammed on the ground, causing the earth and stone to splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between Richard and the bronze scale is very short, one person and one dragon just wrestled for a moment, the copper scales crashed into the ground, the dragons near the portal Suddenly, a bunch of magic and vindictiveness were thrown into the sky, but no strong man dared to take off. Richard did not look down to the ground. At this distance, the ground attack could not touch his sole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the dragon camp in the distance, struggling to fly a dragon from here, wanting to escape to the distance, this dragon Slowly moving, it was very difficult to fly, and it looked like a weak and weak look. Richard suddenly remembered that Zonghu had said that his growing biological weapon once sucked the blood of a dragon into a dry, seemingly in front of him. This is a bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled: "I want to run, or leave it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure of Li is constantly flashing, and the wind is rushing. He pulls out the residual image in the air. In the blink of an eye, he chased after the seriously injured dragon. He ruled that one fate ruling was released, and then Lichao rushed into the moonlight. The dragon's neck has been deeply inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped for a moment, his wrists were forced and twisted, and surely this dragon was not known for its defense, and the moonlight sharpness was able to be thick in it. The body turned and cut an acute angle of nearly 30 degrees. Although the wound surface was still not large, it was enough to send out all the effects that could be attached. Richard only pulled out the moonlight and flashed 100 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon screamed in pain, struggling in the air, but the blood in his neck was like a spring, and in the twinkling of an eye, the whole dragon was red, and the dragon was in vain. Flapping the wings, struggling to slide in the air, but still falling to the ground little by little, and finally the huge body squatted on the ground, no longer moving, it was seriously injured, and then hit the key, It was actually killed by a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
