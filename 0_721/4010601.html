			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund is not the first time to be called a nouveau riche, but The outbreak of the Gordon period and the outbreak of the Richard era were completely different. Gordon almost started from scratch, and gradually settled the Marquis's foundation by a miraculous battle. This expansion speed is enough to subvert the common sense of the general aristocracy. That is to say, when the three empires were founded, the wars and the heroes were born. The growth speed of Gordon and the poverty of Archimonde are equally famous. The ordinary knights in the giants are better than Gotton. The thirteen knights must be stronger. As for Gotton itself, the life standards of the thirteen knights are exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the era of Richard, Archimonde’s outburst has a new meaning, and Richard’s philosophy is completely different from that of Gordon, who attaches more importance to equipment, supplies and Logistics supply, in his hands, for several years, the treatment of the Archimonde family fighters is directly chasing the giants, and the core troops are even above the ordinary giants. It can be said that Richard has piled up with gold coins. A strong army, the Archimonde warriors are fierce and violent, and they are not afraid of death. The nesting combat unit is ruthless and ruthless. There are two excellent military sources, and then combined with Richard’s gold coins, the ones that come out are not lost. In the elite of any giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis for all this is that Richard’s unparalleled talent in the construction and the resulting accumulation of wealth, now Richard’s follow-up The people have gradually grown up, and they have established close ties with the Eternal Dragon Temple, and they have received embarrassing support. Although the relationship between the Eternal Dragon Temple and Richard is so hateful, other giants can’t say anything. In the words, if they can maintain the highest number of sacrifices of the entire Holy Alliance in the past few years like Richard, they can also get a different look at the Eternal Dragon Temple. For the great priests like Nolan, when they sacrifice The grace of God is equal to their salary, and the person who is detached, even the priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple, will be naturally close to the payers, especially if the salary is extraordinarily rich, if it is the priest of other temples, even Further, for example, the goddess of the goddess Luo San. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of Gordon's outbreak or Richard's outbreak, it is flawed, lacking in foundation, not a simple vicious curse, but has its true meaning This glory is like building on the beach. Once it encounters a big shock, it will easily collapse. For example, Gordon mainly relies on the extraordinary charm of the individual and the invincible miracle to maintain the centripetal force of Archimonde, but this It can't last long. In the fierce expansion period, the contradictions can be concealed, but once the expansion is frustrated, the contradictions of savings will all erupt. When Gordon suddenly died in the battle of Qi Qi, the Archimonde left behind immediately became disintegrated. The giant crocodile peeked at the side, and the clowns jumped out and tried to bite a piece of meat on the fresh body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floating island, even the rebellion of the knights and the branch families occurred. If it was not for the suppression of the situation and the timely return of Richard, the floating island belonging to Archimonde must be taken away, and it was replaced by Joseph. This kind of thing will never happen in the giants. Once such a betrayal occurs, all betrayers will be beheaded, their families will even be killed, and the stability of any throne will require bones and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Gordon died, the thirteen knights immediately became half-free, until now, and the boxing warrior Wald refused to recognize Richard's inheritance status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard took over Archimonde, the first thing was to stabilize the floating island, and then gradually took over the mess left by Gordon, until now There is a solid situation, but Richard’s weakness is also obvious. The lack of top-ranking powers is the mainstay. In addition, there are too few territories in Noland, which belong directly to the territory of Richard. There is not much in addition to the traditional territory of Ashan. Together, the Marquis is very stubborn, and the Duke is quite far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during the expansion, Archimonde is indispensable to the enemy, in the sacred alliance of the floating island giants, carefully calculated, half of the Archimonde The enemy, the real relationship is only five layers of the royal family and the Duke of Iron and Blood, but Richard is only a good relationship with the individual in the second generation of the two Big Mac families, which is still different from the real relationship. The distance of several planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Faust, the first thing is to shut himself down in the study and start reading the history of Archimonde and the Holy Alliance, day and night, Li It has been read through all the history, and for the first time, the wisdom of talent has begun to deduct the current situation of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords this time to consider the issue of the Duke of Richard’s title, in the final analysis is a conspiracy, to take out the home of Richard’s family, Ake The characteristics of Mond are well known. For example, the Marquis of Sauron and the Count of Goliath are impossible to become the vassals of Richard. Their territory will not be counted by Richard. Elliott is indeed closely related to Richard, and The relationship of the partner is disclosed, but she is essentially an ally of Richard and not a vassal. In the past years, the territory she has laid is still her own, and she will not give her hands to Richard, even if she wants to do so, her The vassal aristocrats and generals will not agree, even if they are within their own territory, the lord can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thousands of years of development, the human aristocratic system has formed a very strict and complete system of rights and obligations, and at the same time formed a system that relies on this system. The huge interest group, if Richard wants to challenge this system, is equivalent to declaring war with all nobles, he is not really crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the problem now is that Richard does not have enough territory of his own. The existence of wisdom talent and real talent makes Richard form a calm and rational side, and the pressure of the environment forces him to choose the fastest way to expand his own strength. Therefore, Richard’s focus has always been on the Faro plane where the mother’s nest is located. Only the plane can provide the most resources and the fastest development speed. Although the territory of Noland has great practical significance, it is at this stage. For Richard, the symbolic meaning is greater than the substantive interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the issue of the House of Lords is to put the symbolism on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha closed the thick aristocratic heraldry in his hand and began to meditate. The title of the book reads: the glory of the nobility Innate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old adage and a true portrayal of Nolande’s human aristocracy. For the sake of family glory, the nobles can not hesitate to fight or even wage war. In the founding era of the empire, glory has a deeper and broader meaning. At that time, on the battlefield, especially in some desperate battles, the casualties of the aristocratic knights far exceeded the ordinary soldiers, because most of them were nobles in the forefront and after the break. A knight who was born, when a force was assigned to a difficult task, such as blocking the chasing after the break, the aristocrats in that army are never allowed to leave, and they will not be separated, glorious and dead, will make the family The banner is even more shining. It can be said that the territories and glory of the nobles of that era were completely made of flesh and blood. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the age of the founding of the country, the glory inevitably becomes even weaker from generation to generation. The political stage is not only on the battlefield, but also in conspiracy. On the rumors and poisons, more and more aristocratic children lived on the foundations of their ancestors. They only had wealth, women and privileges in their eyes, and turned a blind eye to the responsibility they should bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Noland is still a war-torn continent, where wars are carried out all the time, and the strong have unconstrained power, which means the current The aristocratic system does not have enough power to maintain its own function. For example, when Gordon has just fallen, if Richard is not strong enough and fails to pull strong enough support, then Archimonde will be cleared directly. Fu Shide, there is no room for negotiation, and if it is under a stable system, such as the long-standing millennial empire, even if the family suddenly died, the heirs can successfully inherit the family, and at most lose some benefits to the protector. Only then, a stable and refusal to change system is the hotbed of the second generation who are not talented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
