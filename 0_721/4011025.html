			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Archimonde’s list is the object of madness. Not only can you please Archimonde, but you can also get a reward of several times the usual tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the answer from the ghoul and the blood axe, the natural disaster nodded, and the murderous body converges, saying: "You can join this mission as well. We are divided equally, but the task is counted as me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul and the blood axe are greatly astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the natural disasters have come, with her strength, it is not difficult for one person to complete this task. Why do you need to bring them? And the bounty is still divided equally among the three. According to the normal practice of assigning strength, the legend can take half of it, and the two heavenly sanctuaries divide the remaining half. The natural disaster is not a common legend, and her share can be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the natural disaster can be said to be a big sum of money for the ghoul and the blood axe. Unless there is extra content on this part of the task. However, Archimonde did not specify hidden rewards in the description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood axe does not have the muscles in his mind as it appears on the surface. He flashes a flash of light and suddenly says, "His Royal Highness, you are here to make good friends." Look at the Highness? The price is a bit big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster took a look at the blood axe and said: "You are as sly as the rumor. Yes, I am I want this task to pull down the relationship with Richard Chapel. If it is possible, our natural disasters are ready to join Archimonde as a whole." This news, which shocked the mainland, was so lightly described from her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood axe was taken aback and said: "Now join Archimonde? But...not to mention the reaper's war, I listen It is said that the army of the sacred tree dynasty attacked the Ashan collar the day before yesterday, and now the war between the dynasty and Archimonde has broken out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wells listened, The face immediately flashed the color of excitement. Richard is invincible, and Archimonde is stronger and cannot be the opponent of the entire sacred dynasty. As soon as Archimonde is destroyed, he will have a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster seems to be deliberately wooing the two, patiently explaining: "If it is not now that Archimonde is in desperate need of power, you think we will have the opportunity to join and become the core Followers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the sacred dynasty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you still don't know the latest news. The army of the holy tree dynasty in the black rose Under the fort, the Count of Ellie was blocked by the castle. Their number advantage was ten times, but they could not break the defense of Ellie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ghouls and blood axe still hesitate, and it is surprising that Archimonde is able to block the army of the sacred dynasty with the remaining military power. But being able to hold on for one day does not mean being able to hold on for a week. Maybe tomorrow, the Black Rose Castle will be broken and then lose the war. Even if Richard is strong, the Holy Tree Dynasty has enough power to balance him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster said at this time: "The second news is the former warrior of the Calando continent, the Royal Highness of Asa and the imperial prince of the Millennium Empire. Before arriving at Faust, he officially joined Archimonde's points battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real big news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa has long prestige, and defeated the Battle of the Fallen Eagles of the Millennium Expeditionary Forces in one fell swoop. Later, in a twilight counterattack against Dakosodas, she again defeated Dakosodas' superpower and proved the strength of her superpower. It has since become a famous earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goshawk was one of the most outstanding four of the younger generation of the Millennium Empire many years ago. Now that the four masters of the year are already legendary powerhouses, the Goshawk himself will at least not fall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, they have a special status, each behind them is the Snow Mountain Holy Temple and the Millennium Imperial Family. No matter which background is not ordinary people can look up to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two joined the Archimonde points battlefield at this moment, naturally not only for that point, but certainly deep meaning. As for what is deep, it depends on the imagination of the individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if participating in the point battlefield is only equal to putting one foot into Archimonde’s gate, the combination of Asa and Star Sage can be considered a Complete super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Archimonde has two super strong towns at the moment! Such strength is that it is not impossible to defeat the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Archimonde's biggest card is actually Richard. Once he is forced, he just wants to give up Faro and return to the mainland. Under the full counterattack, in addition to the three imperial royal families, I am afraid that no family can stop the anger of the super strong and the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the blood axe first said: "Well! If the natural disaster can join Archimonde, then count me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Scourge nodded and looked at the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I say no?" The ghoul has no choice but to spread his hand. However, he asked one more question: "Why bring us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster faint smiled and said: "Because the way back is not good. I want The person who plays this little guy's idea is more than me. I need help. This is the most important task that Archimonde has released recently. Many of my peers know the news that I just said, and I want to use this opportunity to go to Akmen. De loyalty. The future of His Royal Highness is not limited to the Holy Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul and the blood axe finally got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground world is more realistic and cruel than the upper class. They are extremely respectful of strength, and as long as Richard can maintain the overwhelming power, there is no need to worry about the loyalty of these guys. In a sense, these people are very similar to the mother nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to dispose of Wells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard was killed without any suspense, and in the terrifying tragedy, Wells’s vindictiveness was broken, and the limbs and bones were all opened. Then the wound is forcibly healed by the secret medicine. In this way, his limbs are considered to be abolished, and he wants to restore his ability to move, unless he cuts off his limbs and then re-emerges with top-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood axe wraps Wells with a canvas and carries it on his back, and goes with the Scourge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they left, several waves of mysterious characters arrived at the scene. Looking at the land, their faces are very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man carefully surveyed the scene and looked up to the other three groups of people who stood by and said: "It’s a ghoul and a blood axe! It seems that the two of them have joined forces. If you want to grab this task and become a follower of His Highness, we can only do it with teamwork. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Join hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joining hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two batches of killers have shown attitude, and The middle-aged people headed by the third batch hesitated: "The natural disasters have not yet appeared? This is not quite right. They are not strong enough to ignore this task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The old man said: "I have friends in the natural disaster. Their three most powerful people are not in Noland at the moment. They should not be able to catch up. As for the natural disaster, no one knows where she is. But Judging from past records, this task should not be put in her eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows? If you count the opportunity of His Royal Highness followers That's not necessarily the case." The middle-aged people are still hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sneered: "Want to get such a big benefit, how can you risk it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged people also know this truth, especially the killers they walk in the gray area, but they are always at great risk. He hesitated because he was too afraid of natural disasters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this opportunity is really rare, the news is from inside the Archimonde, said to come from a core follower. Archimonde is ready to absorb followers again, and does not limit birth and past, the attraction of the dark world is simply fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are two more constant pursuits, there are two constant pursuits, that is, eternal life and breakthrough limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two points are sometimes combined into one, and they can become super strong, and life will last for more than a thousand years. In the short time, Richard is a super-powerful person, and he is a unique god-builder. The hope of following him and getting a breakthrough will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some legendary powerhouses that have been stuck in the bottleneck for a long time, the way to break through is to control the rules. In this regard, Richard may be the only master of the entire Noland. Just look at the variety of structures he has published, and the wide range of coverage, you can know how many rules he has mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of God's Battle of Midrande has only recently been discovered. This means that Richard has begun to touch the general rules of the cross-plane, and he is still so young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
