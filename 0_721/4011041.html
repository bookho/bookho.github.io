			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angle of the Thunder is now the chief technical officer of yīn Shadow Prince, specializing in Responsible for the construction of the magic warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yīnThe prince’s shipbuilding base is located in its own private plane, where there is a rich mineral and magic crystal plane, and the time flow rate It has been added to an extremely rare twelve times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that plane, the yīn shadow prince has a total of twelve giant docks, which can be built at the same time. After the magic warships are built, they will The portal opens directly to Noland, and the plane portal is placed directly on the sea on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yīnThe prince’s wealth mostly comes from the design and manufacture of various types of magic warships. It is said that he has obtained a lot of jīng spirit empire magic warships under a certain chance. The design of the design gradually established its own shipbuilding industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level of magic warships should not be sold to the sacred alliance giants that are still in hostile state, but it is said that Richard is only sending yīn shadow princes After a letter, the Prince agreed to sell the warship and gave priority to the highest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be hidden, but it is not the edge of the blade or the anger of the thunder. This level of people can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold also quietly asked the Iron Shield, and Richard suddenly ordered the entire fleet, for what, the Iron Shield did not know, he was only responsible for receiving The fleet only, Richard sent him over, but also the intention of crushing, no matter what people from the Polar mainland sent, as long as it is not a super strong, the iron shield has to deal with it, even if he can not beat, he can also drag to Richard. The ability of defending fighters in this area is one of the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handover was completed very quickly. The battleships were in very good condition. It seems that the yīn shadow prince did not move any hands and feet. When the last battleship passed the inspection, the iron shield Just started the communication magic array and contacted Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magical array is not a simple image, but a lifelike three-dimensional scene, Richard is standing on the snow peak, before the cliff, staring The front of the mountain is stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Shield’s heart glimpsed, knowing that Richard did not know how to keep in touch with the communication magic array set up on the floating island. This will happen to this scene. Richard is certainly not in the floating island, but how is Richard? To this point, I have never heard of the fact that there are people who can communicate with the communication magic array thousands of miles apart, regardless of the warrior or the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the iron shield has been following Richard for a long time, but the awe of the lord is increasing with rì, he found some small things that Richard inadvertently did, Just like this one, if you think about it, it is actually like a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fleet has been handed over." Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Working hard Then, please stay in the dark blue for a while, Palin will modify the warships in the past, you must ensure that his work is not disturbed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question, Your Highness." Iron Shield paused and asked: "However, Your Highness, this fleet is for what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Li I didn’t have the meaning of secrecy, saying: “I will use it to cross the ocean and go to the green continent. I heard that the magic warship of the jīng spirit empire is very famous, so since I am going, the warships that I bring are not bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield eyes suddenly release the same light: "The green continent is going to find the troubles of those jīng spirits, very good, there will be a new point battlefield." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "You are full of points, you don't think about it, my point battlefield will not be directed to Noland's interior." of , only to the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield is slightly lost, but think about the current two points battlefield, plus the points earned as followers, is enough It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic communication was closed, the iron shield suddenly thought that when he saw Richard last time, Richard seemed to be standing at the top of Xuefeng, I don’t know what to think. What, people like Richard, every minute and every second is extremely precious. If there is a daze of time, it is better to do more construction. Therefore, Richard must stand there and must have something extremely important. It’s just what this is, and the Iron Shield can’t guess it anyway, I don’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Magic Fleet completed the handover, Palin took dozens of Masters and hurriedly flew from Faro to Deep Blue. Then there were still a group of fighters who constantly moved the materials and even used the Stars in the end. The required materials are shipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling spent a whole day climbing up and down in a huge ship, reading it all over the inside, and then began to assign tasks, he Using Richard's warrants, most of the workshops in the Deep Blue were requisitioned, and then a piece of design drawings and corresponding materials were distributed, and the workshops were ordered to build the parts according to the design drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin also brought a lot of equipment that has already been manufactured, and one piece began to be installed on the giant ship. The reserved space is prepared for these devices. If there is a strong war with the Reaper, you will find that many of the equipment looks similar to the Reaper's style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s time is extraordinarily leisurely. He will be quietly standing on the snowy peaks in the north every morning. One stop is a whole day. In the evening, you will return to the floating island, or eat risotto with Coco, Freire, or talk to pasters like Tiramisu about past events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Richard seems to have passed the ordinary people’s rì, no longer designed and manufactured, and on the territory and private planes. Not much management, completely letting his followers do it, and family affairs decisions are more empowered to Alice, Goliath and Sauron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His strange behavior made many people unable to understand, and finally one day, turbidity rushed to the floating island, saying that the undecided queen wants to see him one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is pleased to go to the appointment, this time in the restaurant and the unpredictable face, the Queen of the Holy Alliance is still as strong as the past, just like a no Sheath sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sit opposite each other across the table, through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the side, is the beautiful floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to look at Richard, and Richard is looking back at her calmly, and suddenly she suddenly wrinkles her eyes and says, "How is this going back?" Things, how can I not feel your momentum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said gently and said: "After the reaper has played, the mood has changed." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then what have you been doing recently, how can you not be aggressive, whether it was injured in the war with the Reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity listened, too Frowning his eyebrows, staring at Richard and looking up and down a few rounds, although Richard eventually defeated the Reaper, it does not mean that there must be nothing safe, just like Philippe the Great played two Dakosodas strong He was seriously injured and fled, but he was also seriously injured and finally died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard is also so turbid, the more the eyebrows lock, the tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and stretched out his right index finger, and his fingertips flashed a little. This light is not strong, but the angle, brightness and timing It was just right, just because the turbidity was staring at Richard, but when the mind was loose, in a flash, the turbid eyes were full of flashes, and no one else could be seen. There was an illusion that it was to be bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid screaming, subconsciously flashing back a few meters, but before he flashed back, Richard had picked up the knife and gently tapped on his chest. And then from the tolerance, Richard's movements looked clear and soothing, but until he put the knife back, the turbidity began to flash back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flashback, the turbidity suddenly can see things again, his eyes are no problem at all, but the flash of the fingertips of Richard’s fingertips appears too suddenly. Only then can he shake his eyes and lose sight of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity suddenly bowed and saw the place where the energy core was hidden in the middle of his chest. The clothes broke a small mouth and it was just being eaten by Richard. The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled at this time and said, "Look, I just lost most of my strength, and it’s still very good, not to mention that my injury is now completely good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what are you doing, is there anyone who is looking for you trouble, who is it, the old things of the holy tree dynasty, they still do not give up "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the murderousness of the unsettled ascension, Richard said helplessly: "Not the sacred tree dynasty, then again, now dare to come to me who is in trouble." There are not a few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing snorted and said: "This is hard to say, many people don't convince them, always Don't give up, but if you want to fight with those super strong, you are too soft, or I am going to go. Under my hand, defeat is death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
