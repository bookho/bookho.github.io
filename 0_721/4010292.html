			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, one of the seventeen-level middle-aged knights Richard took two steps and said one by one, saying: "I don't want to surrender to you, Master Richard. Just according to the tradition of the Knights of Noland, we have reason to ask for better treatment, to show and ordinary. The difference between the soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight’s attitude made Richard very satisfied, and one knee was already the courtesy of the knight’s oath of allegiance to the lord, not to mention the courtesy. He is also a knight who can not bow to the lord. The knight is so respectful, not all for the sake of survival, but more because of the identity of the Richards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face turned peaceful and said to the rest: “Do you mean the same thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of you look at me, I look at you, nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the quasi-construction knight still has to work for me for five years, but enjoy the treatment of the officer. After four years, you can choose to go back to Noland to serve the rest." Military service. The knights need to work for me for four years, enjoy the quasi-construction knight treatment, and choose to return to Noland after three years of service. In addition, if you are willing to choose the magic oath to ensure loyalty, then all treatments are According to the formal members of my army at the same level, the effectiveness time can be shortened by half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of Richard made the knights relieved, so they In surrender, there are more than a dozen or even a magic vow on the spot. They all went to the shortened half-year military service time. No one really took the treatment of Richard’s official army as one thing. Archimonde's army is notoriously shabby, and the treatment is simply not comparable to the old-fashioned giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one knows now that Richard and Gordon, and even all Archimonde are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Richard was that the original 17-year-old middle-aged knight actually chose the magic vow. This is an unexpected surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart rejoiced and called Gangde, and said: “Reorganize all the people and set up a separate unit to be directly directed by you. One hundred black-wing knights are left as law enforcement teams. In addition, the equipment they need is taken from the warehouse. Some places are not listed enough. I go to Noland to buy.” The Knights of the Black Front are the female-level knights. The foreign number, although one is not enough to suppress the possible rebellion, is enough to give an alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two thousand five hundred Noland warriors, Richard can be described as a tiger, plus the existing structure of the knight and the nest of the humanoid knight, Richard There are more than 4,000 super elite troops on hand. Based on this, Richard even had the confidence to go to the hinterland of the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handled the business of the camp and immediately walked to a separate small building and shouted at the gate of the courtyard: "Can I come in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old voice came from the courtyard: "Is it Richard? You are free, I am your captive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pushes the door, an old man in the courtyard is drinking coffee under the tree, and there is an open history of Faro on the coffee table next to it. Starlight at night is not enough to see the book, but there is a small cluster of magical flames hovering over the sky, projecting enough brightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the door, Richard smiled and said: "A big magister should deserve the respect he deserves everywhere."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician shook his head with a wry smile and said, "I am just an ordinary magician, and you are now at the 16th level. It is only a step away from the big magician. You are less than twenty years old now. I am a small mage at the age of 11 at your age. In front of you, how can I have a little proud capital?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李笑笑Sitting on the opposite side of the old man, said: "Master Mito, if you are polite, you will not say more. I am here, I hope you can help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old magician said indifferently: "I just have the heart, can you rest assured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, took a reel from his arms, put On the table, said: "Really! The destructive power of a big magister is really amazing. No one dares to put a big sorcerer who is not loyal enough. I am the same. So, I prepared this, So we can all be assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito glanced at the reel and raised his eyebrows and said: "Magic slavery scroll Don't you think this is too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this can be trusted. And you can also see how my followers live. Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito smiled and said: "I did have observations, so this magic slavery scroll is not unacceptable. But how long is the time limit?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Richard had an idea and said: "Five years. But in these five years, your treatment will be the same as before, what the Joseph family can give you, I also The same can be provided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito sighed and said: "The Joseph family can give me confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles: "This is temporarily impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito nodded, some sad, said slowly: "I am just Sigh, because I have seen the decline of the ancient Joseph family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not seen." Richard gave an unexpected answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito brows and asks: "Are you going to let the Joseph family go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard shook his head and said, "Of course it is impossible to let them go. This war must end with a complete overthrow of one party. I just don't like to predict before a thing can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito does not know why, the heart is slightly cold. And sitting opposite Richard, obviously Richard is two levels lower than him, and there is no strong ability to get at the 18th level, but Mito always has a vague sense of oppression, as if life is threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but think of the final bloody battle. At that time, Richard’s body was full of electric light, and his sword fluttered in his hand, relentlessly harvesting a life. And with the knowledge of Mito, I really don't understand how Richard did it! The Dark Blue Master is known for his strength, but that is not to say that the 16th-level Master can simultaneously issue 16th-level vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are so-called geniuses in the history of Noland, but only in terms of energy and time, double repair is the most undesirable. of. Generally speaking, some special occupations will double-tune when they are just starting to understand another profession in depth, but there will only be one major direction after the tenth grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was silent, so Mitto knew that time had arrived. He smiled a bit, took the magic slavery reel, solemnly issued a vow, and the scroll ignited a flame, and the vows began to produce restraints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and stood up and said, "The sand will come to Faro these days. When she arrives, I will let her Come over and treat your injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito just thanked, and suddenly suddenly saw a flash in his eyes, and he rushed to the hospital door and said, "Who?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard door opened silently, and the nephew of a black and white robe came in and said in a plain and silent voice: "My name is Naiyou, and the life of the sand-sanded adults is To treat the injury to Mito's Magister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Naiyou, especially her left black and white, contrasting the strong robes After watching it for a long time, I finally looked at her right black and white pupil. It was unbelievable for a long time: "You are... the priest of the eternal dragon temple? Why haven’t I seen you before? And, the time on you How is the force so weak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou said in a constant voice: "The priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple does not necessarily need the power of time. What I am good at is Soul power, you will be eternal in the future . House often see me "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Richard Nye looked quiet, more and more tightly locked eyebrows, always feel that something is wrong. However, she does have an inseparable mysterious connection with the sand, just like Io. All in all, this nephew makes people feel uncomfortable, the atmosphere is cold and gloomy, and it is like a god official, clearly a ghost that walks on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the brand of the Eternal Dragon Hall is real and true, and Richard then let her let go, and she is watching. His hand was on the knives of the extinction. If Nei You dared to move his hands and feet, Richard was sure to cut her two arms in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou looked at Mito, and the eyes began to rotate and quickly turned into a dark gray. Why not live, Mito, who was pegged by her, suddenly felt that the body seemed to be transparent, as if all the secrets were seen by Naiyou! His creeps, a scream, instinctively jumped out of the chair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito only jumped back to the ground, and his physical strength seemed to be much stronger than the average person. But his body quickly flashed with dazzling magical brilliance, and his hands were forward, and his white hands were like blue. The light of the stars continued to flow from the void between the hands, and there was a gushing galaxy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the gods fell on Mito, healed the big and small injuries on his body, and even some minor injuries on the internal organs were in the gods. The effect is fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen that the magical technique that Nai’s works is big or small, and that the effect of the magic itself is not so outstanding, it is similar to ordinary priests. . However, Nai's method of casting magic is extremely special and very precise, and it can almost release a magical spell for each small injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This overall treatment effect is much better than a powerful healing. And she has a strange ability, that is, can split a common magic, such as a treatment, can be used by her to be broken into ten times. Even if it is a subtle injury, Naiyou will not waste a little power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito seemed to be shocked and stepped back two steps after landing. But when he stood still, he found that many of the dark wounds that had been on his body for a long time were missing, and he couldn’t help but feel stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
