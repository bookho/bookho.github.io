			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three days are spent busy. The Elf poet, Gangde and Shuihua took turns to guard against the baron's army. The cannibalist transcribes the scrolls of the language in a day-to-night manner, or directly on someone. The ogre has always lacked patience, and the part-time job of the foodie has not given Tiramisu even a spoonful of patience. So the boring work is simply tormenting it to go crazy. But it is a smart ogre, knowing what is most important and will not affect the real big things for your own preferences. These linguistic scrolls allow all people, including the seven stepping knights, to learn the lingua franca of their own face in three days, although they will be born, but this is the first step in establishing a foothold in this position. Their return to the path has been cut off, as an intruder, once failed, then death is the best ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu does not like to work, but it is a happy thing to be able to work compared to death. As for the boring, clever ogre made up for himself with food. His daily job is to copy the scrolls, sleep and eat. The most unique talent of cannibal wizards and priests is that they don't have to meditate. Sleeping is their best way to restore mana, and the efficiency is better than most human mage meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-five is another busy. He takes on as much work as he needs, and when he has time, he will make and repair steel armor and weapons. In this regard, the ogre once again surprised his human comrades, his craftsmanship is comparable to the most skilled dwarf craftsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working is equally boring, but triad is a means of exercising strength. Power is the most important and most proud of the ogre. The more powerful power not only means direct improvement of attack power, but also means stronger defense, because it can be covered with thicker steel. And as the power progresses, it will also increase the level of the ogre. The ogre also has vindictiveness, but it is not as dependent on vindictiveness as a human knight. Their powerful power will always make the battle very simple. The triad has already felt that he is not far from the eleventh level, especially this battle has made him a big step forward. When he really reaches the 11th level, he can change the weight from one hundred kilograms to one hundred and twenty kilograms. At that time, even the power-type sealed knight would be beaten by him, and Sir Mintel might be able to block a few times, but he would never be willing to fight hard with the three-pointer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is busy in their own way, and they are studying their long knives and new clothes. She clings to the white dress, but does not like the feeling of restraint, so she tears the trousers and turns into a dress similar to the culottes, which makes it feel comfortable. Whenever she is, she is always barefoot, and the white feet are rarely dirty. The guide to the eternal sleep is another thing in the study of water, and this gray long knife is held in her hand, and there is always a feeling of heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Oral is constantly trying to get close to the water and get her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Bard will innovate a new poem for her every day and give it to a girl who has never laughed. Rarely see what he practices, perhaps chattering is the way the bard is promoted, otherwise it is difficult to explain where his level of bard who has been promoted to level 9 comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two beautiful girls, after a short temptation, Oral instinctively stayed away from the quicksand and chose the splash. He is simply fascinated by this wild girl, and for his compliments, temptations and even concealed courtship, the water is not explicitly rejected, and sometimes it seems to be some encouragement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral has never been amazed by the style of clothes that he chooses. It is a shocking lament for the guide of the long knife. All of the above can also be understood, in such a wild and beautiful girl, no matter what kind of clothes to wear is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the specific style of clothing, as long as it meets the standards of light and short, it will certainly not be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the leader of the eternal sleep can be seen as a great power through the battles of these days as long as it is not a scorpion. This knife is in the hand, and even Gangde, whose strength is stronger, is not willing to provoke a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elf poet is not very convinced of every move of the water, or that it is difficult to understand. For example, in his opinion, the perpetual guide is definitely a rare enchantment weapon, and it is more important to use it than anything else. However, the water flower used a lot of precious time to play with a rough and rough steel chisel, and sometimes even polished a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her polishing is not to sharpen the polygonal steel cone, but the opposite is to make it rougher. According to her own, this can increase the power. Oral couldn't understand why this would increase the power, but when he saw that Gangde looked like a face, he couldn't help but anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This barbarian is actually not understanding! The elegant, profound and artistic elf poet thinks angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the base makes Oral feel unsightly, Gangde is definitely one. This barbarian has a lot of time around the girl, and the girl does not mind that he is next to him, and even practicing the knife does not avoid Gangde. Another point that makes Oral dissatisfied is that Gangde’s eyes are always very strange, and his eyes often turn around his ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gaze makes the elf poet alert the barbarian's sexual interest, but also evokes some of his less beautiful memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gangde, always seeing the water is playing with her multi-edge steel vertebrae, I always feel that the lower half of the spine is somewhat chilly. He suddenly felt that he should take some time to polish his big axe and sharpen it. The big axe is a bit too rough, and it is almost the same as a polygonal steel. He also looked forward to when the elf poet couldn't help but touch the watery butt, and there would be a very good ending in that case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened more than once in the death camp, and each time it was a long time for the camp to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the death camp is actually very boring, so all people are longing to leave the ghost place earlier. Being able to see an ignorant person suffering from physical and mental trauma is definitely a delightful pleasure. There are so many things like this, and what the bad guys have done is also distinguished. Those who can barely walk, but dare not sit down, can only sleep, that is, they have not touched. And if you really touch it, it will become a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is taking a lot of time to perfect the construction of the sand. In the next three days, Richard did not make any more mistakes until the magical increase was successfully completed. As the sand says, if you look at it, it will not be amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final finished construction, the magic increase of 21%, has reached the upper limit of what Richard expected, and can not ask for more in the current situation. According to Sands himself, this configuration brought her an extra powerful treatment, three treatments and seven micro-injuries. This is equivalent to a whole life of a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
