			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong guys are holding their breath at this moment, and Ou Ruo’s arm is gone. The long swords of the tempered swords are not deformed. The volume of the residual part is directly reduced by two-thirds. What kind of flame is actually so powerful?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blue is hot At the moment of burning, more than one strong man perceives the desolate and deep silence of the blue fire,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the destruction of the world, the end of everything,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sword, just a sword, has smashed Ou Ruo, whose strength is close to the sanctuary of heaven. This is an overwhelming power gap. Everyone understands that if Richard If you like, this sword can kill Ou Ruo on the spot,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo stands in the air, his eyes are dull, and I don’t know what happened, he looked down and glanced down. I lost my voice: "My hand, my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue fire at the tip of the Lomdock Sabre is finally extinguished, but the count Sabre also A third, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sabre in his hand with some regret, and returned it to Lomdok, saying: "It’s a pity. This is a good sword, I will compensate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomdock took the sword and put it back in the sheath, smiling and said: It’s enough to be able to see your last blow. It’s that this sword can’t carry your strength.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Ou Ruo has calmed down and squatted right The wound on the shoulder, his face said coldly: "You are already the deadly enemy of Master Fitzrok, and soon you will taste the consequences of a future sacred architect. Now, report your name, you Will pay a double price for today's business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li leaned back, leaning on the back of a comfortable chair, said faintly: "I didn't kill you." That is, let you go back and inform Fitzrock: For your sake, he has successfully turned into my enemy, my name is Richard, Richard Archimonde."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With a bang, the auction hall is instantly boiling,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People rushed to stand up, stretched their necks, and tried to take a look at what Richard looked like.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for a very small number of people, most of the nobles present have not seen Richard, the portraits that have been passed down are very rare, but outside the Holy Alliance, Richard is already a legend, with many mysterious auras,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The youngest sacred architect of today, when Archimonde is the weakest, only hands to reverse the situation of the homeowner, known as the invincible military god of the battle, the most proud student of the legendary Master Su Hailun and the little white face that brought her to the hand I went to the mainland of Carando and robbed the titles of the thief under the mountain and the sea. No matter which one is enough to be a topic of high society for a whole month,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foundation and temperament of the Millennium Empire was different. After the initial shock, the nobles quickly calmed down and restored order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo already The chaos went quietly, and after hearing the name of Richard, he even There is no room for swear words, no matter what you say, it will only make the jokes bigger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo pays a very heavy price, is blue The arm burned by the fire can't be recovered at all. In the future, it will use the magic to give birth to a new arm, and the strength will fall. The legendary sword is also his small half-length,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard did not kill him, it was equivalent to going to his half life,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving Looking back at Richard, I remembered what Richard looked like. He knew the importance of the heart of the mountain lord to Fitzlock, and he knew that no obstacles were encountered on the road to the holy architect. Fitzrock will never give up, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction will continue, and the high-quality auctions that surprise the participants will be endless, and the heart of the mountain lord can only In the middle part, you can't be the finale of the finale,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it just happens to Fitzrock and Richard is of the utmost importance. One is a long-time master and the other is a new sacred sect. The two masters face each other in a confrontational match, let the mountain lord The heart finally took out three times the price, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard won the divine crystal of 500 units at the cost of two top-level sacrifices. I have made a few rare materials and paid the price of a top-level sacrifice,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction of the Millennium Empire was extraordinary, allowing Richard to take out six top-level offerings in one breath, not only spending his savings, but also owing the debts of two top-level sacrifices,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the St. Architect, the two top sacrifices are a fifth-order construct, which took more than a year, and for Richard, this time can be greatly shortened. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo is also right, in terms of wealth, the average person can not compare with the builder,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction ended, Richard was accompanied by Lomdok, and many great aristocrats were preparing to start from Lomdock to get to know Richard, Richard and other builders, he Also known for his suits and tailor-made designs, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the first time I saw Richard’s many powerful people left with questions, Although there have been rumors in the past, most people always think that it is a rumor that all the builders are masters. This is the common sense of Noland. The holy builder should be a legend. Teacher, of course, the Master will be close to the fight. It’s not too strange, but Richard’s sword is the one that shows the ultimate skill. This is generally the domain of the legendary comrades,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, there was a shocking news among the upper aristocrats of the Emerald Lake,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland One of the four sacred architects, Richard Akmond, who has just announced his departure from the Holy Alliance, has come to the Emerald Lake and accompanied by the royal agent Lomdock to participate in the Empire auction. The six masterpieces of the top prizes fully demonstrate what is called the wealth of the holy builders,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, compared to Richard’s brilliance, Fitzrock becomes A great background, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before the news spread, and another, more exciting news spread on a smaller scale, at the auction site. The chief evaluator of the empire believes that the blue fire that Richard saw during the swaying is very similar to the smoldering nature of the Star of Destruction. It can even be considered a homologous, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message has really alarmed many real big men,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Prince of Tumen was highly regarded in the Millennium Empire. The great man who was also known as the Four Eagles with the Goshawk was now born with a blessing and no hair left on his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance looks like a big businessman, not a man who controls the power of one party. Only the deep radiance that occasionally flashes in those small eyes will make people feel that he is different.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the news came, Prince Tumen was using breakfast. He was listening to breakfast while listening to many dynamic reports on the mainland,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard two messages about Richard, the Prince of Tumen unexpectedly put down the knife and fork and began to seriously think about it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commanded: "Go and find Lomdok, and please come to Master Yuntu. I will wait for them in the living room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Luo Mdock and the chief appraiser of the Empire, Yuntu, came to the living room of the Prince of Tumen,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a living room with a distinct elf style, many furniture are Naturally grown by trees, the Prince of Tumen relies on a reclining chair made of tree vines, with his eyes closed slightly, listening to Lomdock and the cloud picture about Richard. Cut the details, and insert one or two questions from time to time,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than an hour, the Prince of Tumen sat up straight, showing a contemplative expression. Shen Yudao said: "In this way, Richard is very likely to have mastered the flame of the Star of Destruction. This is not from the structure, but from his blood. Is it that Akmon's blood has the power to control the destruction? The ability of the flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a white, no variegated cloud master slowly said: "I think that is the case, now Archimonde The blood can be included in the top bloodline of Noland. In my observation, the potential is probably above the Golden Moon River under His Royal Highness, and also above the Thunder Destroyer of the Holy Alliance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tumen's two eyebrows, which are almost invisible, are tightly twisted together, without sound,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Lomdok said: "According to the information currently available, Richard’s real age is already twenty-five, but from the age of sixteen. Now that nine years have passed, Richard has no descendants. This is a testament to the extremely powerful blood force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen reveals a playful smile: "Interesting An ancient blood, hidden in such a powerful force, Archimonde, as far as I know, in the sequence of the abyss, this demon can only be regarded as one of the upper demons. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
