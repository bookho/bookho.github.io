			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is the autograph of Marquis de Soul, which lists the family of the Billus Information, behind the information of some important people, there are several comments of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note by Baron Billus caused the attention of Richard, which was only a short sentence: suspected to be a Solomonsburg scholar mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also Solomon Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s pupils are slightly shrunk. If the Bilus family is really a scholar’s ​​mage, then the act of the magical soul stolen by Lucien was explained. However, the Solomon Castle Scholars are more powerful than the Prophet Masters, and can accurately calculate the time of generation of the magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks deeply about it, and thinks that this possibility is not big. Lucien’s intention is to just explore the true strength of Archimonde, he may be floating. The island has been turned around, and the family warehouse is one of the most important places. Even if the core part cannot be seen, the overall scale and the type and quantity of ordinary materials can explain many problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovering the magical soul should be just an accident. Lucien intended to steal the magical soul, on the one hand to strengthen his own strength, on the other hand, it hindered Richard from becoming holy. Builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has a lot in the name of Baron Billus. From the perspective of pedigree, the baron is the uncle of Lucien, and there is nothing in peacetime. In the meantime, even if Richard wants to kill Lucien, it is difficult to find a good excuse to be implicated in the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly read the information several times and then burned it with flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, as Richard has risen like a comet, the families of the Ashmonians have also changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gialia and Sauron have maintained independence, but they have started to interact with Richard after the war. After a period of contact with Richard officially cooperates in different fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Sauron is also a veteran Marquis, has obvious advantages in intelligence and contacts, and has now become an important source of intelligence for Richard, and Goliath sits The Kemende death training camp has also continuously sent the candidates for the construction of the Cavaliers to Richard, with more than one hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gordon rose in the past, both Sauron and Goliath still had the spirit of contending, and the momentum of Richard’s up-and-coming was even more fierce than that of Gotton. Nowadays, the comprehensive strength is far above Sauron and Goliath. There is no room for challenge. The title of King Akmon is deserved. In addition, they all participated in the end of the day when the defending war was over. After the birth, there were subtle changes in mind. Perhaps this is also the two giants put down. One of the causes of competition for the patriarch and family cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information provided by Marquis de Soul is very reliable, especially the conclusions he wrote personally, but he has not missed it, so Baron Billus can definitely be a a famous scholar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi’an is young and has a flat grade, but there are examples of Raymond in the front, and most of them are also a scholar mages. Otherwise, what about an ordinary young poet? It may suddenly let Richard eat such a big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific Master, is also a scholar of Solomon's scholar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Raymond to Billus, and to the unknown unknown gift of the magical feathers, the Solomon Fort scholars seem to be exceptionally independent of Richard. Interested, always look at one side of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard never likes this feeling, not at all, although he is still a holy constructor, but the study of deep red fires is like this. Stagnation, if it is not a real talent to become a soul hunter, Richard does not know when he can become a holy builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific Master is a group of strange people. They seem to have no purpose in doing anything, but in fact there must be a reason in the depths, but now Richard is not sure what it is. The reason prompted them to appear around themselves, and even interfered with his development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has repeatedly paced in the study until the morning light, and did not think of the reason, but the reason can not be found, does not mean that there is no solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness, Richard gave orders to several elite squadrons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to Hughland, recall Semma and let her stand by at Black Rose Castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Go to Faro, recall the twilight, also stand by in the Black Rose Castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Ellie immediately return to Faust, and the west line is fully closed, and it is mainly to stick to it. Tell her that the Holy Tree Dynasty will not have a big move in the near future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the order was issued, Richard entered the magic lab and began to study the fragments and manuscripts of Midrand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the focus of research, time always flies fast, when Richard sorts out the list of materials from Midrand, it is almost dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders issued here have all received timely feedback, and both Twilight and Senma have arrived at the Black Rose Castle, and Ellie has not been far from the Black Rose. As long as she arrives at the black rose, she can send it directly to Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness, Richard sent the information of Baron Billus to the twilight, and said: "Kill this person, do it clean, even the soul Don't let go, you go with Samma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight reading the information, replies: "To deal with such a weak guy, it is necessary to go so Many people, I am already too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly replied: "That is a scholar wizard, you are going to destroy his soul, and Senma You can completely destroy his **, and you can completely solve him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The twilight slyly and slyly returned, then Standing up, he said hello to the blood patron saint Samma, saying: "The master's order is down, let me go, let's kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯Soon after the color and Senma’s departure, Ellie also went to the floating island through the ultra-long-range transmission and entered the study room of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time no see, this female goddess of Archimonde has not changed at all, but the appearance is more delicate, a little more in the past The feminine, this is the effect of the young leaves of the tree of life, it not only keeps Alice in youth, but also wipes out the scars on her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful." Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li did not expect that the first sentence of Richard was actually this, when the next one, there was something that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard gently patted Alice's face and said, "But I still prefer what you were."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you look for me. What's the matter?" Ellie's breath was short, her face was red as fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One small thing, there is a man named Lu Xi'an who represents the Biluth family who is attending the Royal Safari Club. He has stolen my magical soul. When the safari meeting is over, you will take someone to pick him up and kill him directly on the floating island. You don't need to interrogate or listen to what he said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Lü Xi'an, I heard that he and Venica have a relationship, and Venica is your sister. It doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed Tooth, said: "Tomorrow I will leave an order to expel her out of the Archimonde family. In these years she has completely lost in the glitz of vagrant life, and has long forgotten the aggressiveness of Akmon's blood. Adventurous, she has always felt that her identity is important and has the potential to be awakened by blood, but she will find herself out of the wing of Archimonde's name, and she will find herself nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But she is your sister after all"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is already on Gotton's share, This is not the case. Her recent betrayal and violation of ancient obligations are enough to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, since you have decided, I will Nothing more to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li wants to go, but finds that Richard changed direction, just between her and the door, instinct immediately Let her burst into panic and eat and say, "What do you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have an old obligation not completed" said, Richard The hand reached out to her button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is desperately trying to stand up honestly, but the body is not obedient, and kicks silently to Richard’s body, this foot Insidious and hot, but also out of the surprise, he was a traversing, and he was able to avoid a kick that could be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bang, the rest of the waves that Ellie slammed and kicked, and even the heavy desks were overturned, showing that her conditioned reflex zone was vindictive, and It is all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Li has sufficient resources on hand, Ali, who is an important member, is naturally given priority, so she can also enter the sanctuary. She has been through the battlefield, and every move is simple and succinct, so the time to enter the sanctuary is short. But the force can not be underestimated, this sudden kick, almost let Richard eat a boring loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice This is an instinctive counterattack, she can't control herself, and the more she controls, the more deadly the attack will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and she went to bed more than once, of course, knowing her faults, and now seriously, Ellie has no chance, after a close fight, He was thoroughly subdued by Richard and then pressed face down on the desk that fell over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not over yet, and Richard waved his hand and two magic wraps came out. Elliott’s hands and legs were pulled apart like invisible ropes, tied to them. On the four legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was shocked and shy, struggling hard, but she was superimposed with more than a dozen weak classes of magic, which was suppressed as much as ordinary people. When Richard was in a close fight, he could continue to be in a state of instant magic. Ellie was thinking for a while and couldn’t resist it. After a while, he followed the instinct, and the result was messy. Then he was weakened by magic, and the result became weaker. The sacred domain is strong, and in the blink of an eye, it can only be left to the mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Ellie screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, what should be done." Side said, while Richard stripped her off, and then violently entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li’s body is tight, then slowly relax and begin to cooperate, but Richard knows that this is only an illusion, her quirks may attack at any time, and attack It is very deadly, and the magic winding can't bind her for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of fulfilling the ancient obligation, Ellie suddenly screamed and the whole body suddenly collapsed. The ability of the Richards to supervise the army has already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s voice has never been controlled again, and it’s getting more and more sharp. Richard finally had to pause a little in the middle to display a noise barrier. Only then can she control her volume, but Richard, who is in the barrier, obviously enjoys the higher and higher sound waves, so the attack is faster and more awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
