			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes are close together, it seems to be just sleeping, but very Obviously there is no life at all, but Vatican seems to see another shadow in him. It is a very vague illusion, which seems to overlap with Gordon’s body, but with the footsteps of Modred. Shaking, it will always overflow from the body of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, why do they go to the bottom of the abyss." Vatican stood under the hourglass, and there was always some vague uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little shadow of Vatican’s heart is always lingering, Gordon or Mordred, it would not have been her. The mood has an impact, they live, they die, and they should only be a hero or a hero in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it’s different, the emergence of Modred, and even let FS have stopped, does this mean that his fate has been with the eternal dragon The temple is intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, known as the devil, may be just a coincidence in the appearance of fait, and the coordinates of the powerful legendary shuttle plane are also needed, and fascinating It is one of the most dazzling lighthouses in Noland's plane. He may just return to a familiar place to find his way to his destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the abyss, the deepest part of the world, the beginning of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline finally raised her hand and shot the power of time. She wanted to see the fate of Gordon’s future, but the hourglass devours Vatican’s The power of time, shaking a bit, the internal sand has turned out to be chaotic, a small and frenzied storm in the little world, can not form any image about Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s body trembled, and a blood blew from the corner of her lips. There was a burning pain inside her body, which was the damage caused by the power of time. Very difficult to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the physical pain can't conceal her inner shock. In the Temple of Twilight, she paid a great price and could not see the fate of Gotton's fate. This shows that either there is a very powerful force to cover up the future, or that Gordon is now outside the scope of the power of eternal and time dragons, no matter which one, is shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican sighed, and when things got to this point, it was beyond her ability. Although she did see a lot, she still had limited knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the Qiqi plane, why there is a scene of demise destruction, can only become a mystery, to see Mordred again, maybe figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her heart suddenly passed a detail that had just been ignored, that is, when going back to the process of Modred crossing two portals, In the corner of the picture, some of the skulls of the Dragon Dala Mo A appeared. At that moment, there seemed to be a vague flash of light in many of Dara's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful eyebrows of the great priest are tightly together. How can she not confirm whether this detail has actually appeared? This is an extremely unusual situation. But now her time has been exhausted, and she is no longer able to trace back to the situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time backtracking is a very powerful special ability. Even the gods of eternal and time dragons, only a few talents have been available in the long years. As with all overpowered abilities, time backtracking has strict limits, and some restrictions are even difficult to explain with rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when Vatican backtracks a scene, she can only use the power of time at that point in time. Once the power of time is exhausted, It is no longer possible to trace back this scene. Such a restriction can only be explained by the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon, or the Law of Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard is patrolling around the Black Rose Castle, cleaning up the traces of the family council once and for all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a shell left in the Black Rose Castle. The interior art and antiques are looted, even the fakes have not been let go, but let Richard Surprisingly, the black rose castle is truly the most valuable thing, as many as twenty urban defense giants and their spare parts and arrows are intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the persistence of the guardian general, and partly because of Sauron’s concession, and Sauron has never been prepared to take over the entire Akmende leadership. And therefore did not move the wrath of Discra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Rose Castle is the symbol and traditional fief of the Archimonde of Archimonde, the wrath of Discra is the symbol of the Black Rose Castle under the control of Gotton If the Marquis of Sauron covets the value of this legendary python and plunders it, then after Richard successfully enters the Black Rose Castle, it will inevitably lead to a war with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the benefits of the Akmon patriarch may be that the Black Rose Castle and the Yashan City are not large, not rich, and the obligations they carry are often above the income of the Territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now facing the obligation he should bear. He has already patrolled the castle, standing on the terrace where the lord spoke, and pressing the black underside The Mond Freedom Warrior announced the recruitment plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Rose Castle, there are about 3,000 free Archimonde soldiers coming to apply, most of whom have qualified step knights. The ability, a few levels have not been achieved, the actual combat ability is actually almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has promised to recruit an unlimited number of knights, and promised that their treatment will be comparable to other giants, and now Richard is ready to fully honor this commitment, Each time the Knights have more than a thousand initial installation costs, as well as nearly 300 military squads and the same room and board expenses as the military squad, this is the piece. Richard’s military expenses will increase by 5 million this year. It will cost an additional two million troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the Gordon era, the same number of step-fighting knights cost as little as 800,000, then it is necessary to count the Gothic training policy to the branch family expenditure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised Richard was that among these Archimonde, the number of candidate knights was close to two hundred, and most of them reached ten. At the fifth level, there are more than ten people who have even crossed the seventeenth level. Although most of them have stopped at this point, there is no perfect opportunity to be a sanctuary, but it is the best choice for the knight. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the ranks, Richard has offered salary ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 for these candidate knights. This treatment is not compared with other giants. It’s too good to say that it’s a medium level, but in the history of Archimonde it’s an unprecedented high salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free Archimonde soldiers gather in the Black Rose Castle, more for the family's identity in the blood, and the desire for blood and glory, otherwise Gordon could not recruit so many loyal fighters with such low to poor treatment, but even so, Gordon was limited by financial resources and could not recruit too many fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Richard, it is opening up a new era of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the numbers announced by Richard, the following Free Archimonde soldiers could hardly believe their ears. Some even suspected that Richard said that it was not Norand’s human lingua franca. Indeed, one of them jumped out of Richard’s mouth. The numbers are so thrilling that they have never thought of dreaming before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Free Archimonde soldiers confirmed that they did not hear each other, there was a burst of cheers like a tide in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the cheers subsided, a man with a crossed knife on his face walked out of the queue, and he turned back and pressed his hands down, Free Ake The Monde soldiers are quiet, and obviously he is very appealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha recognizes that the man’s name is Brolin, a legendary figure among the freedom fighters. He can fight for good and has great courage and wisdom. Although the level of the seventeenth level is not a strong one, it must be known that his original talent is not outstanding, and he can only reach the fifteenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, year after year, Brolin relies on the perseverance and courage of Superman, killing blood on the battlefield, exploring survival in the Jedi, and miraculously Breaking through the bottleneck and reaching the current realm, such as a person like him, the actual combat power is far more than the opponents of the same level, and even comparable to some Sanctuary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters respect the place of Brolin, but not in strength, but in his quality and perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloolin looked up at Richard, and the calm voice spread throughout the audience: "I am not aware of your authority, but I still want to Make a suggestion, we came here, there is indeed an idea for a bowl of food, but that's all. You can give us a quarter of the number you promised, or even less. It doesn't matter. Money, you can use to recruit more troops, build more knights, buy more weapons and mounts, and we, people, are more willing to honor the promise of yesterday, that is to lead us, will burn The battle flag is inserted into countless planes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blorin said in a word, the freedom fighters behind him are already bloody, making waves of mountains and tsunami The treacherous battle, the murderousness that rises from the sky, provokes that the burning flag of Archimonde is flying against the wind, but at this moment, the burning flag fluttering on the flagpole of the Black Rose Castle, the central emblem has been replaced by Richard.
