			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the curtain of time, Nolan distorted the light curtain with his own power The time flow rate makes it slow and fast, but the feelings of people inside have not changed. They are still casting according to the past rhythm. All the spells that need to cast time naturally become faulty. As for the consequences, the spells are reversed. It is light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elder elders did not have a spell explosion, which has shown their power to control, but even then, when the curtain disappeared, there were fourteen Nine of the elves' elders were seriously injured by spells and lost their ability to fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the great priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall, Nolan’s magical technique abolished the majority of the Druids present, and the time was strong and strong. Within its coverage, spellcasting will be affected, regardless of the number of people, and it has nothing to do with the level of the caster. Even the legendary powerhouse will be affected, and the stronger the caster, the more serious the damage will be. The level of magic out of control explosion may not be able to kill the big magister, but the legendary magic explosion can certainly kill the legendary mage, want to resist the curtain of time, only to see the mastery of the rules of time and the ability to control the law, without the rules of time, For any caster, unless the ability to control the law is strong enough, the only way is to stop the spellcasting and wait for the magical effect of the curtain to disappear, so that within the scope of the curtain of time, the caster who can't cast the spell is equal to the cutting board. The meat can be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the black robe was killed by Richard in the thunder, and the two elders who were good at melee also died under Richard’s breath, most of the law The elders were again invaded by Nolan, and the ability to cast spells was abolished. It was already the same as the abolition, but the elf elders who had escaped from the curtain of time had not been thankful, and they were cut down by the twilight. More than half of the damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior's warrior is on the platform from all sides, although the ogre kills the Quartet, but he can't block such a large platform, on the platform. The elf warriors looked more and more. At this moment, the whole forest camp suddenly violently vibrated. It turned to the side and fell. The guardian elves on the edge of the platform stood unstable, and many of them were planted directly. The soldiers who climbed halfway all fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the painful screams of the war tree were filled with people’s ears, and instantly became the only voice in the world, supporting the corner of the forest camp. At the moment, the ancient tree of war is screaming at the extreme pain. The thick trunk slowly tilts to the ground and plunges to the ground. The forest camp immediately glimpses, and more than a dozen war trees in this corner are struggling to lift Only to stabilize the forest camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen ancient branches and roots of the war are constantly twitching, and there are several huge deep pits near the roots. The bark, which is one meter thick and hard as iron, is worn out, revealing the tenderness inside. Milky white tissue, the bursting of the wound is very deep, both hurt the heart of the tree, no wonder the old trees of war can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiator of all this, Caledon’s Highness of the Mount and the Sea, just now 11 tons, and looked at the war tree next to him. Then a stick smashed up, and the war tree in the shackles was bombarded with tons of gunpowder. The bark sawdust shattered, and the thick tree was nearly one-third indented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war tree shouted in an alarming way, and the tree that was created could no longer support the heavy pressure of the forest camp, and it was directly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea burst into turmoil, but it took a lot of effort to knock down a war-old tree, but did not expect that the war tree people would not fight so much. The stick was interrupted, but when she was lost in the forest a few days ago, she and the ogre also met several war trees. As a result, most of the trees were hammered down by Tiramisu. Individuals need to make up the second hammer. The ogre's heavy hammer is named ten tons, and the slender iron bar in the hands of the barbarian girl is called eleven tons, so it is not too unbelievable to stumble a war tree. Great achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze looked to the war tree next to him, and the tree was immediately shocked, so some were fierce and trying to scare her away, while others simply The trembling trembled, in order to pity, these tree people had to lift the forest camp, so they could not attack, and could not escape. Therefore, the powerful but unfortunate war tree would be knocked over by the mountain and the sea for more than a dozen. Live and stumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the forest camp suddenly vibrates, and the branches of the trees underneath the support are creaking. The mountains and the sea look up and think, it should be One by one, the knights fell on the platform of the forest camp, while the long whistle sounded, and Richard summoned the orders of all the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl gently let go of a group of war-torn trees, and casually grabbed a war tree and climbed up. Above the top of the head is the big hole she wore. The war tree people have quite high wisdom. The tree man who was climbed by the girl immediately understood her meaning, and quickly took the initiative to hang down the branches, then lifted the mountains and the sea and sent her into the big hole. Only with the other war trees people took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mountains and the sea climbed back to the platform, they saw that the knights had all fallen on the platform, piercing the remaining guardian elves one by one, and squatting under the platform. Half of the elf elders died in the hands of the twilight, two In the hands of the flowers that died and returned, all the guys who could survive were those who responded quickly. When they saw the situation, they jumped directly from the edge of the platform. Anyway, this height is very difficult to fall to death, and most serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the top platform of the forest camp has been cleaned up, and the guardian elves are mobilizing forces to arm inside the fort, trying to use the complex environment to attack Richard, but Lee However, they were not prepared to let them go. The stars descended directly on the top platform, and the knights were picked up one by one. Then they vacated and floated to the sky, leaving behind the twilight, water and ogre. It has already risen a hundred meters in the air, and then it has exploded into the sky and caught up with the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the followers, the star has an elegant turn, and flies away from the distance, leaving behind a riddled forest camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard has never seen a black robe, he feels a similar atmosphere to Iscara’s power, and those mutant elves should also be From his hand, he knows that he is behind the scenes who control the guardian elves, killing the black robe and killing nearly half of the elder elders. It can be said that the entire guardian elves are extremely heavy blows. It can already be called glory. If it is delayed, when the tree people put down the forest camp, then there are more than a dozen war trees in the past. It’s not that Richard can handle this now, let alone thousands of guardians around. Elf warriors, and both Richard and Nolan have lost their ability to fight again, so Richard took the initiative and immediately took the star to evacuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a day, Richard has returned to the army, and the army immediately turned around and returned to the base city along the road opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has completely reached the goal of Richard, harvesting a whole three life trees, almost all the high-level tribes of the guardian elves, and also killing The mysterious sheep black robes, with the strength of the black robes, in the plane of Green Sen is equivalent to the Pope's level, but Richard's offensive is too fierce, so that he can not play half of his strength Come out, if you continue to go deeper, the nearest tree of life is also two thousand kilometers away. It is more than forty days to march in the forest. It is beyond the replenishment ability of the army, and after this battle, the guardian elves must have Learning to be smart, when the army of Richard has close signs, most of them will immediately migrate the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
