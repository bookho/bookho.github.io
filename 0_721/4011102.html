			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland has entered a period of dramatic change, and the territory of the human empire has undergone fundamental changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the traditional three empires, there has been a deep red kingdom, a behemoth with the same terrorist power, and Archimonde finally reached the top of the mainland. Silver Moon Elf also enters the field of vision of many elites who are good at blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is a natural change. The three empires made a meeting and confirmed the new territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the Crimson Kingdom is responsible for a single regiment fortress, but as the endless night elves enter the dusk, Dakso Das The complete demise is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard stayed in Noland, a young wizard came to the dark blue and asked to see Richard, who took the token of Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Maudred completely merged with the abyss, he used the power of incomparable horror to tear the space and sent the juvenile mage to Noland, who was once The Rodi University was put into the abyss to cut off the fate of the young apprentice, but Mordred happened to pass by and took him down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred’s seemingly random move left the line of destiny that should have been cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young mage wished to see Richard, and he wished to start his studies in the dark blue. His life changed from now on, but it was not just his fate. And the scholar's mage, when Richard saw the boy, he knew the location of Solomon Castle: the deepest part of the eternal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex of the eternal vortex, with the most violent energy and the most peaceful corner, Solomon Castle is built in such a corner, on the day of destiny At the time, Solomonsburg welcomed a special visitor, Richard Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the castle that changed many of his fate, and the scholars in the castle who almost changed his life, Richard just sighed softly. As his mind floated, a black hole quietly appeared above Solomon Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard turned and walked into the portal. He didn't want to, and didn't need to go to see the final fate of Solomon. Unless he reached the peak, no one could escape a black hole. This is not the resurrection of Solomon. The quiet corner will be completely destroyed by the black hole, and in a few minutes, Solomon Castle will always be history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may be remembered, perhaps forgotten, but Richard has no interest in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Solomon Fortress annihilated in the long river of time, Richard returned to Archimonde’s family cemetery, step by step up the top of the cemetery, and then personally Dig a deep pit and put the armor left by Gordon in it. Then Richard took out a small box with the ashes of Elani. He sprinkled the ashes on Gordon’s armor and then took them. Buried together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of a stroke, a tombstone appeared on the new grave with the names of Gordon and Elaine, and Ilani’s wishes. Finally realized at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the family cemetery, Richard thought about it and left a blank tombstone on the cemetery, which he reserved for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed quietly, and the floating world finally came over to the Faro, and merged with the body of the mother's nest. All the damage of the city of miracles was caused by This has been patched and turned into a powerful floating fortress like never before. Richard will control this city of miracles and pursue his dreams: to explore the ultimate in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ultimate exploration journey, Richard prepared for a whole year, and the fascination was renewed, and all the people who were there were there, except for no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky of the ice floes, Richard is standing opposite the faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must go," asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is still lazy and replied: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset image of the ice floes In her body, every artifact is so radiant, but after this excessive exaggeration of glitz, Richard saw a deep bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly said: "You seem to owe me a promise, you promised me, when I come back from the dark side of the world, you let me see Look at your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this thing." No face is innocent, but Richard's gaze is firm, and it is not shaken by her little tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face finally shrugged and said: "Well, it seems that there is such a thing, but there is no difference between watching and not watching. I still have to go." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, no face raised his hand, slowly took off his mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard held his breath for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mask, there was nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face actually looks like a movable armor shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put on a mask and said slowly: "Now do you understand, I am not going to go, but I should not have come, in three thousand years. Before, I should have left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no face turned, walking toward the setting sun, her figure gradually merged with the sun, all the way away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels that the heart is unparalleled, he wants to call, wants to stay, but knows that all is in vain, she has already left, three thousand years ago . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu Shide finally arrived at the start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sits at the window and overlooks the magnificent scenery of Noland. This situation may not be seen anymore, in this beautiful On the mainland, the new generation of Archimonde may struggle to come up with their own legends, perhaps like many giants, annihilated in history, no matter which ending, there is a shadow of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fate is not doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s quiet mood was broken by the sudden sound of consciousness, which was the voice of St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear Richard, are you sure you should not be with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard replied categorically: "I have answered you for the ninety-ninth time, no, no, no, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Richard, you should understand that there is no word forever in the world, but since you answered me the ninety-ninth time, then I will ask the hundredth time: You really don't want to be with me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha some laughed and said, "How many times you ask is not, I will start immediately, and explore the world's ultimate in my own way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your path is bound to have no results, only my path can break the shackles of the world and explore the meaning of life at a higher level."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "How do you know that my path is not good? You are not my opponent at all. You and your believers will not work together. Forgot, if I didn't give you the real name of Desmasen, you can't win the war in heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin not only sound this time Come over, his image appeared in front of Richard. He said with a sunny smile: "Li, no matter what you say You will help me. If I want to lose, you will personally go to Heaven to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Teng stood up and shook his fist: “It’s impossible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “At our level, it’s pointless to deceive yourself, you know your true heart.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneered: "Even if I will help you, it is also because of the owe to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin smiled very sunnyly, but it was also abhorrent: "Well, we should be true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin ignores the roar of Richard, and understates the topic: "Okay, let’s make sense, don’t always quarrel like a child, Let me talk about my path. You know that my belief is light, the purest light, the light you gave me, perfection of my faith, and let me go on the path of faith. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Martin launched his hands, between your hands surfaced a little light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee, our world is like a huge cage, it is a closed loop, and it will automatically destroy everything that might threaten the world. The rulers, I think you know that we are in the seventh era. Before us, there were already six incomparably powerful races that were completely destroyed. Now, Noland has your existence and has caused the rules of the world. Note that you left Noland and went to the depths of the void to explore, in order to avoid the world rules to clean the Noland, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard silently said that Martin was right. At the level of him and St. Martin, there is really no need for self-deception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin’s left hand has a little darkness, it’s absolute darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To break this fate, there are only two viable roads, starting from the light, or starting from the dark, starting from the dark rules, destroying the whole No one in the world can survive, and starting from the light is another result. I will be transformed into light. You can all be attached to me. Then we break the rules of the world and break through to a whole new level. After the world is broken, we may discover a new world and let life evolve to a higher level, but there may be nothing. Waiting for us will be a complete destruction, destroying with this world, if by that time "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin smiled and said, "I will use my own fulcrum to recreate the rules and create a completely new world."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But whether you succeed or not, you will lose your consciousness and lose your soul." Richard sharply pointed out the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether Martin is turned into light or turned into a world, he will cease to exist in the sense of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled: "To find the ultimate in life, there is always a price to pay." After that, he pointed to Richard and said: "But Your path is not going to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no desire to argue with St. Martin at all, just saying: "Impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin said: "My dear Richard, you sacrifice too much, the power is too dependent on the old dragon, your strength, your soul is too much. The brand of this world is no longer able to find a way to break the rules of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was deeply troubled and rubbed his forehead with one hand and said, "I think now, No matter which way, as long as you don't appear, it's all good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Li’s hand lifted and shook the image of St. Martin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before San Martin’s image dissipated, he suddenly shouted: “Richard, one day, one day, you will go with me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to hell." Richard hasn't sweared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Martin disappeared, Richard immediately felt that the world was so clean and so beautiful, he immediately crossed the space into the vassal, and at the same time issued an order, the floating fortress slowly Start, after a ray of light, the city of miracles floating in the world will disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, I don’t know how many times the jump was transmitted, how many planes were explored, and Richard’s perception swept through the endless void, and suddenly found a very interesting The plane, then said: "Looking at the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fo Shide lightly turned and flew to the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a beautiful plane, built a huge altar in the middle of the vast expanse of plains, with raging fire on the altar, and millions of soldiers around the altar. Listed in neat squares, the most elite warriors of the entire plane have gathered here, but at this moment, there is no murder on the plain, but there is a deep anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar, an old, almost unstable ritual looked up at the sky, and stood behind him dozens of people, there were sacrifices, there were generals There are also kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sacrifice, the demon of the exotic will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sacrifice, Are we really going to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prophecy of fate really cannot be changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There are people who can't stand the unspeakable repression and whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Great Sacrifice said slowly: "They have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky Suddenly there was a hustle and bustle, and there were a lot of strange scenes. In the middle of the hustle and bustle, there was not a demon army in the traditional concept of the plane, but a huge city slipped silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plains suddenly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, a thick ancient book in the hands of the old priest fell on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
