			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeatedly watching life several times, Richard did not see other new things. However, he remembered a doubt that has not been solved. With the terrorist strength of White Night, why is this design so valued? The foundation of the Iron Man, not to mention the third-order structure, is that the fourth-order structure has a lot of inventory. The status of the white night in the family is not as simple as that of ordinary children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why does she have to live a life, just for the features that it can superimpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of the colorless eyes of the white night and the horror of people who couldn’t help but scream. That kind of breath will make the horror of life instinct, and I don’t know how many people will kill to gather such a terrible atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing life again, Richard’s eyes are different. He does not look at the detailed structure of this structure now, but begins to experience it. Its design idea, in other words, is its soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long, Richard closed his eyes. In his consciousness, there have been images of white nights, and her arms have already had life. Absolutely. After the white nights of all kinds of stifling actions have been attached to the life, the action is almost a few minutes faster, and the combat power is also improved. Later, Richard began to play the characteristics of life, and constantly superimposed on the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, three, four, or even the fifth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, Richard’s face has finally changed! In the simulation of consciousness, the white night killing power at this time is no longer a word of terror! One by one, the opponent turned into a bloody rain in an instant, and the white night stepped forward, not fast, nor slowed down, and walked through countless enemies, all the way to blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly opened his eyes and his forehead was sweating. He finally glimpsed a path of white nights and saw the soul of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally knows where he is going, and that is killing first! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately made some adjustments to the second consciousness, fully analyzing the sacred fighting techniques, and trying to break the elves, bloody abilities, and even some magic. Use is also fused together. What Richard needs is that no matter what method is used, he must be able to defeat the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal battle of the eternal dragon temple, its mystery and depth are on the top of the elf secret sword. With it as the cornerstone, it can indeed carry other fighting methods. It’s just that in the past, few people seem to have done this like Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has already clarified his future path. On the outside, it will build its own power on the basis of followers, with the mother nest as the core of the war machine, and tactically exert the advantages of its own battlefield control. Inside, it is the pursuit of the road of Modred and White Night, to upgrade the level, strengthen the killing power as the core of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the road, something that is not necessary and of little importance can be released later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and took a deep breath and regained confidence in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the camp, he discovered that it was already dawn. Unexpectedly, he actually thought about it all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant horizon gradually reveals the brilliance of the dawn, and the aristocrats who have risen early can already be seen in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li was buried in his own direction, these nobles were not idle. In order to achieve the heat of the battle, the negotiating table is another battlefield in the eyes of these nobles, and they are the battlefields they are better at. But no matter which aristocrat knows, everything on the negotiating table comes under the table. Therefore, the effort has been done a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nobility came on the head, talking privately while walking, the voice was very low. Richard accidentally discovered that the two nobles had deep eye bags on their faces, and their eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. Obviously, they had not slept well during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nobles saw Richard, and they all greeted with enthusiasm, and hurried away, looking for a place to continue to negotiate. After this period of time, the nobles have some understanding of Richard's style. Richard has always given a general plan, and then how to distribute it, it is necessary for each aristocrat to fight for and balance. Rather than taking a lot of effort in Richard, it’s not as useful as pulling it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the aristocrats increased their troops by 10,000, Richard still took 25% of the total income, but now no one has expressed dissatisfaction and take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha thought about what he wanted to do, so he summoned two elite humanoid warriors, let them point a hundred humanoid warriors and fifty throws The soldiers, the statues of the orcs' ancestors, and even some slate objects used in the altar, were stained with a little divine thing, and they were mounted on several large trucks. They were then sent to escort the trucks to the edge of the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than fifty or so ancestral statues of the orcs, and Richard estimates that providing a unit of divine measure by five statues can provide at least one for the nest. Ten divine. The mother nest evolves to the sixth order and only needs a divine nature. However, Richard has some doubts. Why does the evolution of the mother nest now require divinity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definitely means nothing, but Richard still can't figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a statue of the beast god to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of splitting the spoils, the other nobles did not discuss it and let Richard take the statues. In their eyes, these wood-based things are at most a bit of the value of art, and the style of orc art is not popular in human society, and it can't sell the price. They only think that Richard's aesthetic is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in Richard and the eyes of the sand, it is not natural to collect these things. The value of the statue of the beast is only reflected in the word sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to inspect the statue of the beast, and then returned to his camp, sinking for a moment, and wrote a letter to the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Lord Duke:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure you are still worrying about Palin’s condition . Fortunately, I was fortunate to have an orc statue in the process of running the Western Expedition. It has been worshipped by tens of thousands of orcs for a long time, enough to meet the standards of sacrifices, and it can be used to hold a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, I will return to Lanshui Oasis City. While waiting for the arrival of the new soldier, I want to have enough time to hold a secret sacrifice ceremony. If Palin can appear in the ceremony and luck is good enough, this time may get more grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
