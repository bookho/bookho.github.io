He originally thought that he was in charge of the rationale, and that these elite soldiers who were temporarily transferred from him could at least fight for a public trial from Richard. As long as it is a trial, there will be variables, there will be opportunities, but the timing of the turbidity is too early, but the scene in front of you is not recognized by the Duke. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Link joined the recruitment of magicians, in addition to the dark blue recommendation letter, the Myron family had a guarantee, although it was not a covenant. It is also a cooperation, so that the connection between the Meilun family and the turbidity in the back is not too good, at least it is morally unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good." Richard smiled indifferently, when a full-length armored knight appeared behind Richard, so quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a 16th-level knight, even a long way from the sanctuary. Among the costume knights in the field, the level is higher than her. Less, but she is standing behind Richard, even more than the ogres lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Meren is trying to ridicule another sentence, but suddenly feels the atmosphere is different, look back, but see the turbidity has closed up the smile, faceless Staring at the 16th-level female knight, her eyes are not blinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Meren looked at the horsewoman again. The horsewoman was all equipped with luxury to the extreme, but it was all legendary, but in addition, her rank It is clearly showing the 16th level, an expressionless metal mask that blocks her face and hides her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this woman hide her strength, the Duke of Myron involuntarily thinks this way, but the Duke’s sharp eyes did not see any signs of hidden strength, if he Can not see through, it shows that the strength of this woman is still above her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when the Duke was thinking, Richard opened again, but said to the turbidity: "How, turbid, adults, a 16-level knight can make you hesitate, this is not like your style." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity does not pay attention to Richard’s ridicule, still staring at no face, asking: “Who is she.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity has naturally seen no face, and is impressed by the incredible war madness of the faceless, the dark blue war of the day, the turbidity of the three avatars and the faceless knights seem to be the least Important, but it has become the fulcrum of the whole battle. The three avatars have been wiped out without a face and silence. After the turbidity, I think more and more, and the more I think, the more I am. The combat consciousness and technique are actually equivalent to three 16-level turbidity in the siege of a 16th-level no-face, but in the short time that flies out from behind the dark blue, the three avatars are strangely missing. Things can't be separated from nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is called no face, it is my follower." Richard said with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No face..." The turbidity stream repeatedly recited the name, the eyes are constantly changing colors, and finally the frame is deep purple black, this is a It is similar to the ability of Richard's insight, but the turbidity flow has been tried several times in a row. The facelessness is still hidden in a fog, and it is impossible to see clearly. This woman exudes a turbid atmosphere that is extremely annoying. That is an abomination from the fundamental order, similar to the power of time, not all the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked calm and allowed to observe the turbidity. He also tried to use observation to observe no face. As a result, his sight was blocked on the armor. Down, I don't know whether it is the effect of the legendary armor, or the special ability of no face. So far, Richard has not encountered the ability to transcend insights. Since he can't see through the face, the turbidity is even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity is expressionless, but the depths of the eyes are constantly changing. Obviously, the heart is hesitant, there is no face, Richard or Tiramisu It can be a battle with the turbidity. The presence of two hundred knights in the field is not a display. In such a limited space, once a hundred people hit a hit, they will have a turbidity and a half life. Now the turbidity is constantly determined, the war mad Can be used once or twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s okay to say it once, if it’s two times, then the turbidity will face the legendary Richard and the Ogre’s big lord, and he will have to escape on the spot. The turbidity thought of this, in the heart of the eternal dragon hall next to the temperament than the middle finger, if it is not he is suppressed in the vagrant power is too strong, where you need to look forward to this, watching the Akron family's boy in He is arrogant in front of his eyes, even if he is not sure, he can also play it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is gambling. Normally, the gambling loses the life, and the gambling wins the strong. The victory is still in the two, but the overall situation is the same. The whole two hundred or more knights are already the core of a giant. Power, wherever you put it, is a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But actually, Richard’s heart is not easy, but he is always on guard, because the turbidity is not a completely rational person, he succumbs to the law of chaos. Sometimes people are like crazy people, their behavior is completely unpredictable, and no one knows whether the turbidity will suddenly rise and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is gradually quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the turbidity suddenly gave a feminine smile, saying: "So nervous, what I am doing is just to say hello to Lord Richard. There is something that needs to be solved, although you continue, don't care about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Melen’s face changed slightly, and he did not know what the words were. Intention, so after sinking, he resolutely stepped forward and said: "Lord Richard, Link may have done something wrong, but the crime of being able to get the death penalty is a very serious accusation. At present, the reason you announced cannot be made to Ma Lun. The family is convinced, and whether it is sinful, it is not that the Archimonde said that he is, after all, the heir to the count, and he should be considered by the aristocratic court. Therefore, I demand that Linke be handed over to the aristocratic court now." Some words, powerful, righteousness and strictness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't pay, do you want to grab someone?" Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence immediately put the Duke of Myron in a hurry, he rated the elite, originally intended to see the opportunity to grab people, but the force shown by Richard Powerful and unexpected, and which giants will be full, nothing to do, always on the floating island with more than a hundred construction knights, isn't it a war service, the duke looks at Richard cold and even a malicious smile, heart When I was in a hurry, I suddenly thought of the recent troubles that the Archimonde family had encountered. I immediately thought of a very bad guess. Richard is planning to take this opportunity to declare force to the entire Holy Alliance, and the Myron family. It is the stepping stone that I sent to my door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke still wants to say something, but Richard has reached out for a move, and a builder knight immediately sent a long sword, and Richard will send the sword to the hand. In front of the ground, I said, "If the Duke wants to rob people, even if you try it, my words will be placed here. Whoever the people of the Myron family, if they dare to cross the sword, they will be killed on the spot." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard turned and walked to the transmission array. Tiramisu and the no-face also went with him, but the two hundred-packed knights still listed neat squares, solemnly standing, and the whole transmission hall, that The long sword inserted on the ground was particularly glaring. The Duke of Melen’s eyelids twitched, his hands clenched and loosened, loosened and clenched. He tried to rush over it several times, but he knew that the result was the same. Suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Duke of Myron is now the most dependent, turbid, still standing in the same place, looking at the transmission array leading to the archipelago of Archimonde, do not know Thinking about something, staring at the two hundred knights in front of him, the Duke of Myron suddenly threw an idea and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a violent outflow of a sudden attack, at such a close distance, it is possible to rush into the center of the knight’s camp at one stroke, and to build the knight’s biggest for the legendary strongman. The threat lies in their combined force, but if the type of strongman who is turbid is rushing into the riding, it must be chaotic. At that time, Melun and his army are holding back, maybe it is possible to hit the big half. With the Cavaliers, in this case, the strength of Archimonde is bound to be greatly damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to eliminate the opponent’s hundreds of knights in one fell swoop, the temptation is almost invulnerable, and the Duke of Melon immediately whispered his thoughts to the turbidity, however The turbidity flow, like not heard, still stood in the same place. After a while, he turned and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Myron was suddenly stunned, but his feverish mind calmed down and could not help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of turbidity was originally prepared for a high-sounding excuse to uphold the aristocratic rules and promote a fair and just public trial, and it was barely the responsibility of the royal general manager. Scope, but the establishment of this excuse depends on being able to snatch Linke in one fell swoop, without flowing too much blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Island 14th Gate, can be said to be the 14th pillar of the Holy Alliance. With them, there is a Holy Alliance, and the mutual attacks between the giants are one. Going back, the royal family is one thing, and as the general manager of the undecided, the turbidity actually represents the royal family. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Myron family robbed an uncondemned aristocratic identity squad, and slammed the squad in the volcano and attacked the floating island giants The nature of the Cavaliers is completely different. The latter is the cornerstone of the entire alliance. It destroys the operational order of FS. The nature is extremely bad. In severe cases, it may cause the disintegration of the entire sacred alliance. How do you hate Archimonde? It will not provoke this trouble to the undecided queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
