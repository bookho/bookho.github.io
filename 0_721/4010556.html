The blood of the golden world tree's descendants is not more than one. This kind of thing is everywhere. Richard does not live under the world tree, and the chance of blood degradation is much larger than that of the normal elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, 茜 has become extremely tired, Richard will resign and let her rest, and in the next few days, Richard will discuss with her. How to deal with the current situation, Richard believes that these guardian elves are the enemies worthy of serious treatment, but that is all. In the scope of the tree of the Yongye tribe, Richard’s troops can be affected by the forest will. This range will not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real enemy, or the demon god Isla, who annihilated the plane, observed very carefully, and it can be seen in such a few days. The sigh of breath is weaker, indicating that in the confrontation with the curse of Iscara, Yongzheng is at a disadvantage, but in this matter, Richard is helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day of the Yongye tribe, Richard stopped staying in the tree of life, but left the territory of the Yongye tribe and began to slay alone. The tribe's guardian elves, such as proverbs, he really did not want to face the embarrassment again. He finally saw a mother's relatives, but he was watching her go to decay and death day by day. This kind of pain is not that Richard can be calm. To bear it, he can endure a lot of pain, but he can't look at the suffering people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the Greenson plane is always dark, whenever Richard looks up, through the dense canopy, only a gray, no sunshine, The wind in the forest is also rancid, but the smell of this rotten leaf can't be overwhelmed by the scent of the guardian spirit. The enemy is rancid and dirty. Richard used to think that this is just an exaggerated language used by poets. But now he understands that when hate reaches the extreme, the smell that smells is all stinky as long as it is related to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind came from a stinking smell, and Richard looked up and raised his eyes like a cheetah. He spit out a few Simple syllables, the power of magic gathered from the surroundings, so the figure of Richard was blurred and then disappeared. After a while, Richard appeared under an old tree, gently leaping and reaching for a thick branch. On the last ride, I turned over the branches silently, only to stand on the branches with the toes, just stand like that, just less than ten meters in front of him, a natural hunter of the Yi language tribe is camouflaged with branches With his own shelter, he will focus on this and monitor the activities of the Eternal Night Elf. If he encounters the Everlasting Elves who are single, he will not mind honing his assassination skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard does not mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard silently pulled out the elf knife and gently pierced the heart of the slang hunter, which was surrounded by soft natural forces, even The piercing was so gentle, the blade just passed through the heart. The hunter started to wonder how his heart suddenly became numb. He had already died when he didn’t understand the reason. Richard gently pulled out the elf knife. There was a faint cyan glow on the blade, and no blood stains were stained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current elf knife is completely different from the beginning, the whole body is translucent cyan, it seems that the blade is not the same, and occasionally, the blade is still Will pass a touch of golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows that this long knife was originally named Moonlight, one of the most important artifacts of Elf Wang Ting, the real moonlight is a dead one. The tree of the world tree is refining, and the goddess of the moon, Alusia, personally blesses, with the power of all seven strings, the moonlight is slashed, and the adversary is subject to the baptism of the seven-stringed string. In the silver moon elf Wang Tingzhong, this knife has always been the sword of the great elf king in charge of war. The sky with the long gun in his hand is another artifact of the Elf Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another characteristic of Moonlight is that it can inspire the blessings of Lulu Ai Lucia, thus forming a horrible energy storm in front of the knife holder, which can almost clear In the past 50 meters, in the past history, the Silver Moon elf has experienced several crises, which has inspired Ai Lucia's blessings several times, but the price of the excitement is that the blessing power of the goddess disappears forever. The original moonlight still has one blessing power. According to the speculation, it should be that when Gordon breaks through the night forest, the desperate Silver Moon elf inspires the last blessing power, and nearly 100 sacred allies are exhausted, exhausting the power of the goddess. After that, the moonlight became an ordinary long knife, and it was special to never destroy it. Gordon didn’t know the origin of the moonlight at that time, but only took a glimpse of the commemorative meaning of the forest from the night. Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the moonlight is the power of the tree of life, Richard’s tree of life once injected his essence into this long knife, and the 茜 guides the eternal The night tree of life is filled with strength, and the tree of the night comes from the silver moon elf king court. In the high elves of all bloodlines, its position in the tree of life is equivalent to the position of the silver moon elves in all elves. Therefore, the essence of the perpetual night tree is much more than that of the tree of life in the hands of Richard. Then he infused with a little bit of his own blood force, so that the moonlight has the ability of extraordinary natural affinity, holding a knife. Richard, in the future, can get considerable help in mobilizing natural forces. The effect of all natural spells is increased by about 30%. The power of 茜 provides powerful and sharp attributes for the elf long knife, so it is in the hands of Richard. Even without using the power of life, this knife has become a weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current moonlight, in the words of 茜, is roughly one-tenth of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the moonlight and jumped down the old tree. The killed slang elf still maintained its original position, as if time was in him. The body solidified the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is as a night wolf in the forest, and the natural power of the singer constantly emerges from the surroundings, obeying Richard’s rules and covering up him. The traces left behind, holding his body, and sending the enemy's information to the nose of Richard's ear, soon, Richard smelled the smell of another guardian elf in the wind, so he quietly turned He went to the ignorant prey, and spent five years in the dusk. All of Richard’s perceptual abilities were honed, and the people who survived from the battlefield were top hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 16th-level Druid, killing as easy as the natural hunter, Richard draws back the elf knife and looks at Druid Slowly falling down, the incredible expression solidified on the face, Druid and the natural hunter feel strong, but they are too dependent on the perception of natural forces, in the face of a little rule of Richard, they completely become Hazelnuts and scorpions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight has flashed a touch of gold on the blade, and the two-color blade looks full of mystery, but Richard is not happy, he is bloody. Power infusion in the moonlight, the damage to her own is actually very big, if it is not in desperate situation, she should not be exchanged for such a major sacrifice in exchange for a little gift to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still Iscarla...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name is now a puzzle without a solution, the devil The power of the soul has gone deep into the soul. Every moment, both sides use the soul as the battlefield, and they are fiercely killed. The tree of life in the night is equivalent to a barrier, temporarily segregating the connection between the will and the body of the demon. Only then can she support this for a long time. Once she has stepped out of the scope of the tree of life, the power of Iscara in the soul can immediately connect with the ontology, thus completely overwhelming the power of the blasphemy, and more than that, after destroying the soul of 茜Iscara can even take over her body, instead of walking on the material plane, looking for the next delicious prey. Once Iscara has gained enough souls, he can even turn the whole green forest creature into Your own embarrassment, from then on, there will be only one will and one soul in the whole plane, that is, Iskara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
