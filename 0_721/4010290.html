His gaze inadvertently passed over the place where Richard had just sat, and the whole body suddenly shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Palin’s ideals, Richard’s heart was bitter, and he thought of Palin’s few broken formulas, and he laid out several complicated figures on the ground. . That is the graph produced by Palin's several formulas after they reached the maturity stage, and it is the first lesson when the Norland Magic Apprentices touch the plane geometry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling’s second half of his life was almost immersed in the plane mathematics. As soon as he saw the graphics, his consciousness immediately passed through a lightning bolt and pierced the darkness. In an instant, he illuminated a brand new world, a vast world. Palin's heart is jumping faster and faster, but the body is getting colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Richard is still dizzy, and the whole world is shaking when walking. He didn't even know how he got back to his place of residence and how he climbed into bed. Just think that I am back to the comfortable big bed, then the sweet darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard woke up, it was late at night. The rest of the wine still exists, making his head hurt like a crack. However, Richard found that the accident was comfortable and clean, not only changed his clothes, but also was scrubbed. Beside him, he curled up with a hot, soft body, and his body immediately tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li moved, she immediately woke up and whispered, "Are you awake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard immediately heard that it was the voice of Qi Qi, so he let go of his heart and licked his temple and said, "Well, don't sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when he supports When I got up, my head still hurts and I can't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Qi Qi suddenly wrapped up on Richard’s body, overwhelmed him, and then her body became hot and tightly attached to Richard’s skin. Then indented into the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Richard asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you relax!" has been fully indented by the answer to the Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, a warm and damp heat suddenly wraps around Richard, and there is a wild elf in the damp heat dancing wildly, every dance will be direct Hit the soul of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a sip of cold air and felt that the wave of excitement and excitement was from the bottom up, and he slammed and slammed his heart. . His hands involuntarily grasped the sheets, and slammed the sheets and broke the sheets! Richard struggled to lift his upper body and tried to reach out and hold down Qi Qi’s head, not letting her blame again, but then another exciting wave of rushing, let him fall down, and the hand was also pushed into Qi Qi's hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard finally got a little bit adapted, so he spit out his breath, and his heart is where it is relaxed, clearly becoming more and more nervous. So he finally got up and grabbed Qi Qi and threw it on the bed, then pressed it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Richard finally relaxed, and Qi Qi half-shouldered his quilt, his legs were wet, and he couldn’t tell if he was sweaty or something else. She has not been able to climb completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Qi Qi and gently stroked her face and said, "It's very comfortable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good!" Qi Qi spit out her tongue. This cute little trick is now in the eyes of Richard, but it is obviously not meaningful, almost making his volcano active again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After awakening to destroy the real name, Richard’s physical strength and endurance are not generally strong. However, it is obvious that Qi Qi is not allowed to squat again, and Richard will give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi used his face to lick the hand of Richard, his eyes had begun to open, and muttered: "You go busy, I want to... ...sleep for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha licked her hair until she was completely asleep, and then quietly left the room and closed the door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, and it is near the winter of Faro, the night wind whistling through the blood-stained land, bringing the coolness of the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the wind for a while, and finally the hangover finally dissipated. So he summoned it in consciousness, and the unicorn ran out of the darkness. Richard jumped on the unicorn and went straight to the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Gangde also got the call of consciousness of Richard, and also went to the magic ride, ran back and forth in the military camp, and shouted orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military camp that has fallen into a deep sleep has boiled again, and a team of Noland prisoners slowly sneaked out of the camp to the central playground. Assembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This military camp is isolated from other camps and does not allow anyone other than Richard's followers to enter. Although the guards only have 500 people, they are all composed of humanoid knights and throwing soldiers. The parent nest combat unit has no possibility of dereliction of duty and disclosure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has stood on the edge of the playground, watching the Nolan prisoners gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His unicorn is very conspicuous, Nolande captive saw Richard, slowly quieted from the screaming of the night, looking to Li There are more fears in the eyes of the inspection, and there are even some reverence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many warriors here who know the identity of Richard in Noland, and in the hands of a classic tragic defeat in the hands of Richard, naturally There is fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Noland warriors have a default concept, that is, as long as the Noland army reaches a certain scale, the lower-level army becomes With pure numbers, how many are sent to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the Battle of Portal, although it’s only halfway through the interception, the Nolan’s army in the chaos still kills hundreds of thousands of Faro. The coalition defeated the ground, and the formation of the Knights was a shock that killed the Baroque King Arnold. Therefore, the investigation of a pile of Richard of the Faro army, in the eyes of the Noland people, is still a weak side of the military. Leaders who can win and weaken will naturally get the awe of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for another ten minutes, and all the Noland prisoners were assembled on the playground, and many of them were still carried and supported. But seeing it here, Richard has already pointed out the number of prisoners and does not feel frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was carrying a huge axe at this time, and Zema came to Richard and said: "Li Cha, the captives are all concentrated."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s body is full of vindictiveness, and this god-like man is already guarding the whole god. This does not blame him. There are many senior officers in this group of prisoners who can fight with him only by level. Richard is next to him, Gangde will naturally be nervous, as long as someone has a change, he will immediately rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and frowned and asked: "Gund, how are more than 2,500 people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde immediately said: "There are only these people left, Master Richard! I led the army to follow the marching route of their marching all the way up, and gathered the abandoned wounded soldiers along the way, but in the end only More than a thousand people were found. Some of the wounded soldiers who were first abandoned were killed and died, but most of them were killed by the Faro natives. Raymond left 500 people who guarded the wounded. I also died in battle. In order to get back some of the wounded soldiers, I also played two games with Baroque dog scorpions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing just In the words of De, the Noland soldiers on the playground had a commotion. They actually knew that the abandoned comrades had come off, but they still feel sad when they heard that Gangde said it straight. But the veterans also know that this is the normal state of the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and looked at the captives on the playground, saying: "Norland’s soldiers, you have experienced more than one plane war. Veterans, you should know the cruel nature of the plane war! And this war is a war between our Archimonde and Joseph family alliances. You have fulfilled your obligations and have proved yourself in the final battle. The heroic war. Now that the war is over, everything is recorded in yesterday’s history. And I recognize your fighting spirit, so I sent troops to search for those wounded soldiers who were abandoned by Raymond and abandoned by the Joseph family. They were rescued from the Faroese's butcher's knife and brought back here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Richard paused. The Noland soldiers in the playground or standing or lying are talking about it. More than half of them are indeed found by Gangde and sent here. Many of these wounded soldiers had died from their own deaths. They did not expect to be treated by the pastor after being sent to Oasis City! It is impossible to escape from the dead. If these wounded soldiers say no gratitude, it is impossible. The warring parties are actually nobility of Noland. Prisoners of war can generally choose to surrender, and then become slaves or redeemed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s eyes swept through the audience and said slowly: “Now, I can give you another chance, one has to return to freedom, and return to Nolan. The opportunity of Germany!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playground suddenly disappeared! On the battlefield of the plane, the most hopeful thing for the soldiers is to be able to return to their hometown and return to Noland. Countless scorching eyes fell on Richard and looked forward to the next answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who are willing to join my army can get free after five years of brave battle for me. Rand continues to stay here. All the transfer costs of their return to Noland will be waived! Now, those who are willing to join my army can gather under the flagpole over there!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard echoed on the playground. Several Noland warriors first went to the flagpole. With the example, the remaining soldiers immediately rushed to the flagpole in groups. After a while, the playground center There are dozens of people standing alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard swept through these people and immediately saw that they were all above the 14th level, and the highest three even reached the 17th level. The domain is only a step away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Norland standard, these are the people who have become the standard of the knights, and their status is different. Among these people, there are nine real knights, but in the brutal final bloody battle, their mounts are all killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
