			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling Mina’s murderous eyes, the Tibetan sword and the Prince of Tumen are very embarrassed, one starts coughing again, the other is raising his head and dying Staring at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Asa has been dragged by the Goshawk, and finally pressed into the seat. But when she heard this, her eyes suddenly stared at the Prince of Tumen, murderous, and cold: "Mex is your daughter! You sent her to seduce Richard? I don't know the mountains and the sea are by Richard. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen is already a lord, and naturally he will not fear Asa. Hearing her asking so rudely, snoring, what was going to say, Goshawk stared at him. The Prince of Tumen touched his nose and had to reluctantly swallow the words to be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk shook Asa’s hand and said softly: "Don’t forget, Richard is not only our mountains and the sea, but also the man. Just come here, don't say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa’s heart immediately floated on the name of Helen, and his face suddenly became very ugly. Although the legendary mage has been proved to be in the depths of the void, but before she left the dark blue, it was a character that made the superpowers subconsciously unwilling to think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original dragon group summons, the magic of never exhausting is enough to hate people, who wants to get her sleep for several years, wake up, actually invented The magic of the space bursting these metamorphosis! No one can copy this magic so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the madman of the undecided Queen, it can be said that no superpower is willing to challenge Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great woman who is as rich as a dragon, perhaps the only drawback is that the speed is slow. But that only refers to short-range movements in the plane. If it is a long-distance journey, who is better than Su Hailun who can arbitrarily pass the space portal? Not to mention the void battle that has not been suppressed by the plane rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is more proud and knows that he is not the opponent of Su Helun. That little woman is not a human being at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly remembered that Su Hailun is indeed not a human race, she is the legendary ancient star family. It is a natural tyrannical race that is more natural than human beings. When she thought of it, she was considered a peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the complicated and difficult situation was finally suppressed, the Goshawk finally breathed a sigh of relief and immediately began to tell what he saw and heard in Faro. The Garland Emperor finally listened carefully and no longer entangled with Asa. However, the eyes of the two superpowers have never been met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But gradually the atmosphere has changed. The faces of Garan and the Tibetan sword became more and more serious. Even the Asa who had experienced the final battle in person, and now listened to the story of the Goshawk, there are many new ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen has a tight eyebrow and is constantly thinking hard. He is a little weaker and he is a little hard to listen to. Mina is with both eyes shining, her hands squatting, and she hears God. Under the squeeze of one's elbows, the chest clothes have signs of bursting. Mina’s strength, of course, can’t understand the mystery of the rules contained in the Goshawk’s story. She is listening to the hero story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Goshawks were finished, the three superpowers were silent, and the Goshawks were thoughtful and fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen thought more and more hard, and Mina had no focus in her eyes, I don’t know what story to make in my fantasy world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tibetan sword suddenly asked: "You just said that after the final battle, there are a lot of signs of soul fluctuations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, those souls seem to be centered on Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then, how does Richard's strength change? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshen said slowly: "His injury can be confirmed, strength, strength..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly said: "His strength is definitely going up, I can feel it, at that moment, he...he seems to be in full control. All the rules of the entire plane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this statement, the Tibetan sword and Garan are all moving! They are clear, but how difficult it is to control all the rules of a plane. Even if it is a primitive, low-level plane, this is an almost impossible task. At least as far as they know, no one seems to be able to achieve this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, if a person can control all the rules of a plane, then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No one has an answer, because no one has tried this before, and there will be no relevant theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is thoughtful and says: "Is this the way we break through the bottleneck?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the three superpowers and the goshawks were all immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superpowers are concerned with Richard’s last singular change and his breakthrough. Other lords are more concerned with Richard's gains and care about what he has learned from the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard’s gains are far greater than those the lords can imagine, but they are far less than his own expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Nolande’s business, Richard entered the semi-finished laboratory. At the moment on the bench, there are countless reaper models that are slowly spinning. Richard randomly picked up some of the parts of the model map, disassembled it, and then read it again, and finally sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These components are the key components on the mother ship that have not been broken down by Richard. However, Richard has almost resolved the mother ship, so it took only a few hours to completely open these parts and study thoroughly. There is indeed an Eurasia essence reactivation device, and there is also a reaper's thinking and control center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after detailed research, Richard was extremely depressed and discovered that the so-called embers reactivation device is simply a small space transfer device. After all the embers are recovered, they should be transferred from here to an unknown space, and then sent back after activation. The activation process is likely to be the same as that given by the old dragon, that is, scouring in the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the core value of this device has been lost. Although it is said to be a space transfer device, the level of rules it represents is still above Richard. Such miniaturization, ultra-long-range and trans-plane high-precision, reusable conveyors are equally valuable, but reactivate with Ember Compared with the technology, it is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the control center and the thinking center, they are all devices with limited thinking and computing power similar to the parent nest. They are more often used to transmit information. That is to say, the mother ship transmits the collected information to an unknown place in the void, and then receives instructions from there to control the actions of all the reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the neatly arranged microchips in these hubs represent a completely different rule. It has great value in itself, but it is like the difference between the brain and the mother's nest. Such a limited control center cannot be compared with the real control center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, at the beginning of the war, Richard did not even think about being able to blast the mother ship and capture a complete base of the reaper. So now, although there is a gap with the expected best, Richard does not feel too disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from the situation of the mother ship, the reaper must have a base similar to the base camp, where the mind center must be hidden. The structure of the reaper is very similar to the mother's nest, except that one is a creature and the other is a machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one knows that Richard, including the present, doesn’t realize that the biggest gain in this battlefield is that hundreds of millions of people die under the reaper. soul. Because Richard defeated the Reaper, these uneasy souls regarded the real name of Richard as the ultimate destination, redemption, and eternal detachment and tranquility here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of millions of souls, even if each contributes negligible power, makes Richard's soul powerful to an incredible point. Moreover, the birth and growth of each soul draws the power of rules in the midst of it. They are redeemed here in Richard, and they contribute their own rules to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard, as Asa felt, has completely controlled all the rules of Faro. If you use the rules of the gods to interpret it, it means that the entire Faro plane is like the kingdom of Richard. He has become the only supreme god in the entire history of Faro, omniscient and omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the complete Faro rule system as the backing, it is much easier for Richard to analyze other planes. Even in the near future, as long as Richard is willing and has enough energy, he can even use the rules to construct a new plane from the air, and can make the plane have wind and water, trees and grass, and birds and beasts. fish. From the perspective of a single plane, the ability of Richard has been able to compete with the Creator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that there is enough energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy to create a plane is too much to describe with numbers, but only with a model to accurately describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
