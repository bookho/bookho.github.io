			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant smiled and said: "Very special name, isn't it? They can Claiming to be a foodie in the ogre. However, I need to remind you that these are two very smart ogres. Anyway, they are all ogre, the guy who regards us as food, IQ is not The appetite affects. The more intelligent the ogre is, the more dangerous it is. Don't expect them to have any legal ideas, and don't hope for their loyalty. Their loyalty will only be dedicated to those who can kill them at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the tiramisu behind the iron gate shouted dissatisfiedly: "Human! Don't think of us as ordinary ogres? We are foodies." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha also laughed. The two ogres are really interesting, but he is going to take a look at the seven prisons before making a decision. Richard was guaranteed before he came, and Lord Mofan would prepare a special group of slaves for him. Only the quality of the goods was very good. Obviously, the lord attached great importance to the trust of the Vatican. Perfunctory things. But not everyone can bring it, the temporary plane channel accommodates a limited number of transmissions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are wizards in the slaves, warriors, killers, and even a pastor! A genuine pastor! Being able to kidnap the faithful true priests and become slaves, Richard has a hint of curiosity about the real background of Mova. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there is also an elf bard who is also very special. He actually has a quarter of human descent, and another three-quarters are More rare blood of the sun elf. He is very beautiful, and he continues the beauty of the elves. If you dress up as a woman, it is a big beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last prison led to the attention of Richard, which is actually a dark elf female warrior. She has the typical qualities of a dark elf, arrogant, sexy, killing, and dark skin and long silver hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard saw her, she was shrinking into the shadow of the prison corner, avoiding direct sunlight to her body, and the nature of the dark elf made her almost fit with the shadows. Two for one, if you don't pay attention, you will almost ignore the past. The power of dark elves during the day will be limited, but by night they will become the most dangerous enemy. This is a warrior, not the most terrible female sacrifice in the dark elf. Despite this, Mofan gave her a price tag of 60,000 gold coins, which is more expensive than the two ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is true, the Ogre slave has no other use besides fighting, and the most important use of the beautiful and young Dark Elf girl is not on the battlefield. It is a large, comfortable bed. At least for most nobles, this is one of the unquestioned pricing guidelines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turn around, the assistant asked: "How are you satisfied with your goals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Richard is still considering, the sand behind him suddenly interjected: "Select the eater, and the elf bard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Li Inspecting the gaze, the sand was filled with a lot of tiredness: "They have the potential to rush into the sanctuary, others can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can detect Their development potential?" Richard asked in surprise. If he remembers correctly, he has already received potential testing since he first entered Deep Blue, but the conventional test is almost as complicated as a magic experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded and added: "But the cost is very big, it consumes my god. If I detect a few people, I will reduce the order." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard took the behead and went to the assistant, pointing to the ogre and the elf poet and said, "I want these three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant is a little surprised Looking back at the dark elf female warrior, I don’t quite understand why Richard would not choose her. She can have more than one purpose. This is a private collection collected by the lord for a large aristocrat. When it is known that the sands of the dawn are also on the list of peers, it is not easy to add this good item to the list of supplies. But when he looked at the elf poet again, he thought about it. The great aristocrats have a wide range of interests, and this male elf poet has more than one use, even more than the female elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant who feels that he wants to understand will no longer question Richard’s decision, but will take care of the precautions with due diligence: “I finally need Remind you that slaves are slaves, especially these guys, although they are good things, but they are not willing to become slaves. So they can’t have any illusions about their loyalty, they need to be vigilant at all times, and they are ready to be tough. The means to punish the disobedient guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I have a magic slavery reel." Then, Richard took out three magical slave scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic Slavery!... I understand, please forget what I said." The assistant said respectfully, but the heart was deeply disapproved. The Magic Slavery Scroll is indeed the best guarantee of loyalty, but that depends on the situation. The value of the three reels and the three slaves are almost the same. It is so much wasteful that it is better to buy more slaves. There are many ways to train slaves, and at most one or two are lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre and the elf bard are honestly letting the magic scroll take effect on himself, and then follow Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, the elf bard introduces his life and skills in a poetic language. His name is Oral. The wind is a descendant of a powerful Sun Elf warrior and a beautiful half-elf. Because of the impureness of his lineage, he was rejected by the elves in his lifetime, and he had to follow his mother to wander, then be captured by adventurers and become slaves at an early age. However, the lineage and talent advantage gradually emerged with the growth of Oral. Without special training, Oral also grew into a level 8 bard, and had a good bow. He is 30 years old, in a half-elf with a natural life span of 200 years old, but he is just an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his bard's career, it is actually a strange blend of pastors, mages and killers, and is used to assist in the battle. However, this occupation was not chosen by Oral himself, but by the slave traders for the enjoyment of the great aristocratic owners. His handsome appearance, outstanding voice, and the blessing of the bard's state can make the guests of the entire banquet happy and even fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Mokfand, Richard and Mofan lord settled the cost of several slaves, and in the city concentrated on purchasing some equipment for them, no At rest, I boarded the sea boat that had already been prepared in the port and sailed to the planned island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large ocean-going vessel that can take 500 people. Everyone on board comes from Archimonde or the Eternal Dragon Hall. Screening and birth surveys. In addition to sailors and soldiers, the ship also brought dozens of various craftsmen and as many as ten lower-level wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination of this trip is an island that has never been officially recorded on the Confederacy map. According to the Continental General Law, it can be used as the identity of Richard on the island. Announce that the island is owned by you. And Richard has already named the island, called Samen. This is a word in the ancient Elvish, meaning the beginning of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
