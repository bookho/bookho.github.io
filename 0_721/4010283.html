I found that I felt a bit numb, but on this matter, Nolan was the most suitable person, so he said with a hard scalp: "This is the case, I have a follower who was seriously injured and was breathed by the red dragon to burn. There are a lot of scars left on my body. I want to ask you to use your magic to help her eliminate or at least reduce the scar on her body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A beautiful woman?" Nolan’s voice is even colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said, "It’s the Dragon Master Lina, who was originally one of my father’s thirteen knights, and you may know her." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s face eased a lot, saying: “It’s Lina, I haven’t seen it, but I’ve heard of her. It’s like she’s staying in support of Gotton. The foundation of the industry, because of the lack of military expenses, even sold two pieces of their own epic equipment. If it is her, then I can help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard It was a change of face, saying: "Lina sold the equipment? Is there such a thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan said: "Not surprising! You Ake The people of the Monde family are frequent visitors to the various pawns and auction houses of FS, but they are not buying, but selling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Li is slightly red He did not expect the people of the Archimonde family to be forced to this point. It seems that their poverty has become the norm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I will let Lina come to you. Thank you, Nolan Grand God!" Richard thanked him seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nolan snorted and said: "The red dragon's dragon's interest is not so simple to deal with, and the use of this repairing magic requires a lot of loss. God, so I need compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha eyes brightened and said: "No problem! It can cure her scars! What do you need?" The compensation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan said faintly: "I also lack the structure, you can just give me a third-order construction, just use it. I don’t pick it at all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled and smiled, then nodded and said, “No problem!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan snorted and said, "You are really willing! I can hear that Lina is very beautiful and very sexy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren't for her, we would have died in the Greenson plane. So I will be willing to pay any price." Richard said firmly but firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan nodded and said: "That's good, just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say: "You need to find a time, let me see the situation of your configuration, and what the existing structure is, so as to determine the design of the new structure." Although the detection can understand most of the situation However, for the custom configuration, the more comprehensive the information is, the more conducive to the formulation of the construction plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this, Nolan’s face was slightly red, hesitated and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered something, took out a small box that had already been prepared, and gave it to Nolan, saying, "If Lina comes to you, it will be replaced. I will give this to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard rushed to the floating island, and he had to arrange a lot of trivial things in the family, because at noon tomorrow he would return to the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mysterious temple in the depths of the Eternal Dragon Hall, which no one can enter. It is the sandstone temple where the sands live alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the sand temple is very broad, not so much a temple, it is better to say that there is a world with heaven and earth. Looking at the ground all over the ground is covered with pale gold sand, almost no end, the sky is no endless void of the sun, the moon and the stars, countless gorgeous time and light travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand flowing in the middle of the sand desert, holding the cymbals, is reading the book of time. However, although her eyes fell on the book of Time, there was nothing on the page. Obviously, the mind of the sand drift did not know where to go, and the attention was not in the book of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so embarrassed that she can let her time pass by. In fact, in the temple of the sand, the flow rate of time can be controlled by her, the time flow rate here can reach 30 times of the outside world, and the sand will not grow correspondingly. This is the privilege of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the growth of the gods' divine power depends on the grace of God, and the grace comes from sacrifice. Therefore, staying in the Temple of Sand every day does not bring about the growth of divine power. Even so, the Temple of Time Sand can still be used to learn, comprehend and practice various skills, such as sacred fighting techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every gods, regardless of their talents, can be trained in fighting and magical skills, not to mention the god of eternal and timeless dragons. The best of all is the genius of genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple of the sand, the sand is completely isolated from the outside world. When it is time to start, she will naturally come out to meet with Richard. She needs to practice the use of divine power in the Temple of the Sands. In the words of Vatican, the deeper the use of divine power, the more powerful the control of the power of time, the more able to dispatch and use God's grace. To be straightforward, it is possible to delay the time of returning the debts to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the way the sand is now, the mind is obviously not in cultivation. Her little face was sorrowful and sorrowful, and sometimes she laughed a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the book of Time suddenly shines, and countless time streams fall from the sky and into the book of time. The texture of the pages has become more heavy, and the patterns outlined on the edges of the pages have become more beautiful. All these signs indicate that a large amount of divine grace has been transferred to the quicksand, and this number has exceeded one top sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Richard?" The sand was shocked, but immediately confused: "Where is the top sacrifice, isn't it two high sacrifices?" And I have already added the option to enhance the plane channel. How can he choose other ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the influx of grace is real Yes, and immediately through the book of time, self-funded part of the grace of the sands borrowed, and the rest is temporarily stored in the book of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands stared at the book of Time for a while, suddenly shouted, jumped from the sand, and ran to the sand with bare feet The door to the temple. Although the desert center to the door seems to have half the distance of the world, she just ran in three or two steps to reach the pale gold gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands just ran to the door of the sand temple, and did not reach out to touch the door knocker that was completely composed of light belts. The voice of Vatican sounded out of nowhere: "Sand sand, Richard got three more top sacrifices, and he assigned all the gods of one of the sacrifices to you, so you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted up and cried angrily: "If it weren't for you, how would there be an option to assign God's grace?! I have said that I should not interfere with my affairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Varian said softly: "I don't want to interfere with you. This time I saw that Richard got three extra top prizes. I only influenced the choice of God. But you should know that when I After joining this choice, Eternal and Time Dragon will increase the amount of divine grace that interferes with his judgment as a temptation. This time, he still resists the temptation. You should be happy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is low and the voice is getting low: "I am very happy, but the gods and ordinary people can't change the ending that we see with our eyes, isn't it? And he It is really strong now, and it has also laid an unshakable foundation in Faro. And I put Iowa on his side, so in the future, whether I am not too important, but in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, I am Can help him more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you will do it Predicting the choice of this sacrifice, gave him the most urgent need, and then prepared to lock himself forever in the Temple of Eternal Dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice is a bit stunned, but there is no regret: "Faro's war and destruction have been successfully hatched and grow well. As long as he can strengthen the plane, he will be able to bring out the army of the mother's nest. In that case, the end One day, Richard will be unstoppable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what about that? You can be sure, is that the fate that Richard wants? If not, what is the meaning of your sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline’s counter-question let the sands linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed softly and said, "At the beginning, I was the same thought as you, gave up on myself and pushed him into the mud of fate. But afterwards, if I work hard with him to fight against my destiny, I have a great chance to get out of the woods. But at that time, in order to raise the hope of 60% to 10%, I chose to give up and give myself. Eternal life. When he knew it, everything was already late. Soon after, he flew into the sky and climbed the throne of the emperor. But since then, he has never had the war of conquest of the plane. The day is just to keep myself in the palace and eat hard until I become obese. Perhaps he is comforting me, but seeing what he is now, in fact... I have long regretted it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamer listened, this is the first time she heard Vatican’s past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Vatican said: "So what I have been doing for you is to give you the opportunity to continue to fight against fate, not Always stay in the Temple of Eternal Dragon and watch him in the distance. I can also see that Richard’s road to destiny will be darker and darker, and you will give yourself eternal life and be in the Temple of Eternal Dragons before you can bring it to you. His greatest help. However, your mistakes are actually the same as I was at the beginning. We should actually give them more trust. They believe that they can create miracles and reverse their fate, not at the expense of our sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand thought for a while, suddenly asked: "What if we did our best, but did not create a miracle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin’s voice is extraordinarily soft at this time: “In fact, in the hundreds of years in the Dawn Palace, I don’t know how many times I thought about it, if I could hold on, even if I finally It’s much more happy than ever to fall into the darkness together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I chose..." Flowing sand said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
