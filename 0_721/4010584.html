			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon elders obviously do not recognize this statement. For them, the tree of life is the foundation of the guardian elves, just as they talk about the dark temple. The black robes on the top made a shrill scream, and then a black mist passed, and they appeared in front of the elders of these guardian elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the slang are respectful, but the other elders are standing in the same place, watching the gloomy and dark hall, which can be seen at this time. The black light column descended from the sky and fell on the top of the main hall. The endless dark power was injected into the hall through the light column. The huge pressure made the elders breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutated elves that have come out of the temple have changed, their skin has become darker, and more scales have grown in the folds, on the shoulders and back. At the back and joints, there will be a number of sharp bone spurs of varying lengths, and the stinky water will continue to flow out of their mouths. When they fall on the ground, they will immediately burst into blue smoke, which is more corrosive than acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new changes, many mutant elves no longer stand upright on their legs, but lean over their limbs and rush into the forest like a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the elders of the proverbs can’t stand it, pointing to the mutated elves who came out of the temple and said bitterly: “Adult, this...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious black robe sneered and said: "Why, they are not very powerful fighters, each has the strength of a high-level hunter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes are right. The mutated elves were originally ordinary guardian elves, even old people and children who have no fighting power, but come out of the temple, Especially after the second baptism of the Dark Force, their strength has been raised to the 14th level or above. According to the standard of the guardian spirit, it is the high-level hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the changes of the tribes, how the elders of the guardian elves are happy, the proverbs elders smiled and said: "But they have no sense of autonomy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes said faintly: "What do you need to be self-aware, they only need to know who to fight, and what is the power of carrying my lord? It may not be cost, and the price is already light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the speech, the black robe snorted and turned to look at the converted temple. There are thousands of guardian elves behind the temple. They have already seen the transformed mutant elves at the moment. They are terrified and say nothing to enter the transformation. The temple, and the guardian elf warriors who are responsible for driving them into the temple, stand by and stand by, even if there are orders from the elders, after seeing the mutant elves, they can’t do it to the tribes and watch them become monsters. More than that, many guardian elf hunters are still watching this side, faintly murderous, it seems that if the elders have no other action, they will resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guardian elder said: "The converted warrior is enough, can you temporarily stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe smiled coldly and said: "Dare to resist the will of my master, it seems that you are confident in your own strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With his words, the mutant elves who came out of the temple suddenly stopped, staring at the amber eyes, and staring at the elf elders, many of the mutant elves that had previously rushed into the forest and turned back. Come back, in the dark forest, their eyes are like a little bit of ghosts, the unspeakable horror, stared at by thousands of mutant elves, all elf elders are cold sweat, although they are strong, but they are strong, but In the face of thousands of wolves, only the food is torn off, and the mutant elves will not leave them with bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More variation wizards are back, they form a big circle, enclosing all the guardian spirits behind the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the most real death threat, the elder elders were silent, and the black robe sneered a few times before saying, "Your resistance is meaningless. Now, I will show you the power of my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion of the temple suddenly swells a large black fog, covering the guardian elves behind the temple, silk The black mist of the scorpion tangled the guardian spirit, and then dragged it into the door of the temple. Thousands of guardian elves were dragged into the temple like a bunch of grapes, and none of the elf hunters who had just shown their rebellious will. Exceptionally, all were dragged into the temple. After a while, there were only about a thousand guardian elf warriors behind the temple. They were all dull and could hardly believe what they had just seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of guardian elves, hundreds of elite warriors, were dragged into the temple, without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe did not move, but all the elders of the guardian elves felt that the body had passed a chill, which was the feeling of being swept by the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, give you a look at the means of my creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands The guardian elf entered the temple, but only a thousand mutant elves came out. Then the temple began to tremble fiercely. It could even be seen that it was shrinking and relaxing. It was like a huge creature. After a while, the main entrance of the temple spewed out. After the black mist and the mist disappeared, four mutant elves came out from the inside. These four elves are completely different from those of the beast-like mutant elves. They are divided into two men and two women. Both men and women are tall and beautiful, and they are more guardian than normal. The elves were a whole circle, their bodies were flawless, and the dark skin and dark red eyes seemed to add a lot of strange beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difference between these four elves and the ordinary guardian elves is that there is one more eye in the eyebrow, and the same dark red mullion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the four elves came out, the transformation of the temple was silent, the burning fire at the top of the temple gradually went out, and the black light column in the sky disappeared quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes looked at the four new elves and said with enthusiasm to the almost mad voice: "This is the creation of my Lord, the new era of the guardian spirit." At the beginning, they are seeds, they are origins, they are the first ancestors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black robe’s voice reached the highest point, the painful nickname in the distance Finally, the Everlasting Life Tree has finally ended its pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder said at this time: "Adults, and some of the night elves and outsiders have escaped."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, a group of people who can't even protect the tree of life, not worth mentioning." The black robe was arrogant, then he extended three fingers and said: "I have let three thousand mutants The beasts are chasing them down, and they can all be eaten soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes raised their arms and hugged the sky, saying madly: Down, the army of my Lord will step on the invaders of the plane of the plane, and will turn this plane into the grassland of my grazing lamb forever. Then, the new blood elf will spread to the whole plane, we will be There are millions of troops here, they will become the sword of my master, through the door of the plane, conquer the vast world behind the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hugely chilling prospect, but the elders can't help but feel completely cold because they don't find their place in this blueprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large open space in the forest, and the huge body of the everlasting life tree falls on this open space. On its remains, countless variations The elf was so crowded that he was desperately eating, and even a little residue was not allowed to let go. Suddenly, some of the mutant elves seemed to have obtained an invisible command, giving up the tree of life, but the bee poured into the forest. Going to the distant Licha and his party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few tens of kilometers away, the knights and the surviving eternal elves are running fast, and at this rate, they can be a few hours later. Within 300 kilometers of the base city, it is a watershed. Within three hundred kilometers, the will of the forest will be greatly reduced. Richard will be able to get in touch with the followers and act as a battlefield commander in the base city. The elite squadron knights, they can pass the orders of Richard in the first time and call the army to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team marched in silence, only the cough of Richard broke the silence, and Richard walked on the periphery of the team, while walking to suppress the chaos of the body, whenever When the gray gas broke out, he would cough for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Hai is very quiet, but suddenly many people have heard a sharp rubbing sound, like a beast biting a bone, then a mutant elf appears In front of everyone, it was attracted by Richard’s coughing sound, so I stared at Richard in the first time. In the eyes of this mutant elf, the other people in this team were too strong and far over. It, while some weak targets are protected by the powerful knights in the middle of the team, then the weak and peripheral targets are only Richard, so the mutant elves barely stay, and at the moment they appear, they rush to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer structure of the knights fetched their swords and waited quietly for the mutant elf to pounce on. At the moment it approached the team, several rifles were Will pierce its body, but Richard suddenly stepped forward. This step took nearly ten meters. In an instant, he crossed the attack range of the knight. Richard put the knife on the ground and leaned forward. The full-speed spurt of the mutated elf couldn't control himself, slamming on the shank. It slammed too fast, and it used all its strength. It only heard a few clicks, and its chest collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutated elf fell heavily on the ground and struggled until Richard smashed his head with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
