			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking that she has heavily grasped the lion’s mane, The person shook his head and spewed a black gas from his nostrils. "When such a powerful and vast plane became my private territory of Sinclair, I always found a way to go back. By that time, I would like to see what kind of faces the old guys at home are! I will take them A few old guys hung up and let the orcs here dry their ass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Cinkel said the more excited, the face All are enchanting reds. She did not hide her hatred of the family, but even the two great magicians did not know where her hatred came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, she licked her lips and began to blur the water, saying: "I heard that Richard is very young and very The pretty little guy, if he catches him, he has to give it a try and use it a few more times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great magician coughed and reminded her "Adult, the significance of Richard is to build a knightly force for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been with Sinclair for some time and has seen many strong The man was left behind by her 'multiple use'. Richard is a builder and a magician. He is sure to have a strong word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair nodded a little bit and said, "That saves the point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the eastern end of the blood-stained land, Richard's team is adjoining the edge of the human kingdom and the blood-stained land. Sitting in the battle, Li’s face was dignified and he thought about it. Suddenly the smoke came from afar, and a small team of garrisoned cavalry surrounded a middle-aged aristocrat, Zhang Huang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth batch..." Richard muttered, reaching out to the team of knights and saying, "Stop down and ask!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the team of Richard, the nobleman was scared early. However, he had limited riding skills and knew how to run the sand people. He had to obey and told him to come to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the magician suit on Richard and the badge representing the nobleman, the pale face of the middle-aged aristocrat suddenly looked good and greeted: "I It’s the golden maple leaf, Asadis Asadis, what are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Sequoia Kingdom is developing the Cavaliers.” Richard smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, pioneering the knight..." Asadis flashed a arrogance on his face, but immediately collected all the emotions and turned sharp The gaze glanced at the brigade soldier behind Li, and asked with very good manners and etiquette: "So, is your lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Duke of the Wolf, the column."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waist of Asadis is quite straighter, but there is no unnatural hatred and disdain on his face, not Like the first three aristocrats stopped by Richard, they expressed resentment against the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke is an impressive character, a truly pioneering knight. You have such a lord, and you develop the identity of the knight Very contrasting," Asadis said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His answer is very clever and the comments are very pertinent. Among the three dukes of the Sequoia kingdom, the Duke of the Wolf was the best of the war, almost always in a state of war. Most of his swordsmanship points to the outside world, but there are many times when he points to the enemy inside the kingdom. Therefore, no matter the king or abroad, he will be called the Duke of the wolf in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
