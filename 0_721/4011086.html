			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is as powerful as the strong in the minds of Charles, who killed the Dragon, or Philippe captured the rising sun. This is a grand event! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These strong people are not even aware of the concept of the true sixth-order construction, but they have seen the power of the holy structure and saw it. The dynasty of the Midrande battle version, and the deep blue roar is still above Midrand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acmemond’s points system has always been fair and accurate. Since the dark blue roar is priced at 50,000 points, the real value is not much different from this price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of Deep Blue Howler is very brief, short to some point that makes people feel awkward: "To comprehensively improve the attributes of the carrier, add a fire of destruction to the attack." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the overall property, this one is already enough to overbear, and can also add a fire of destruction to the attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everyone knows that the fire of destruction is the blue fire of Richard, the flame that comes from the Star of Destruction. The power of the blue fire is that many people have seen it, and there are many people who admire hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you now able to attach a devastating fire to each attack as long as you have a dark blue roar? This attraction is simply fatal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 50,000 points is indeed an unattainable price. So far, the point system has been running so far, it seems that no strong one can accumulate 50,000 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strong players are still full of fighting spirit, as long as the system is still there, one day, one day someone will save enough points to exchange for the deep blue roar. The abyss will always exist, and the devil will never kill. There are demons and there are points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know the reaction of the strong, at this moment he was standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, recalling the whole process of making the deep blue roar, even the most inconspicuous The details are not missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deep Blue Roar is a milestone for Noland and a high point in Richard’s life. When the sixth-order structure appears, the history of Noland will change, and the power level will slowly increase over time, eventually jumping to another new height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark blue roar is the key to opening Noland to a higher place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee takes a whole devil lord as the core material, and adds enough activation embers to finally build the core of the deep blue roar, perfect reproduction The power to destroy his real name. The whole process is actually a process in which Richard sums up all his insights in the field of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the deep blue roar was completed, Richard was still unfinished, and the comprehension of the real name of the redemption on the other side was close to perfection. Therefore, the second new six-stage structure, the ultimate redemption, was gradually conceived and perfected in Richard's mind. But now that Richard has no adequate materials in his hands, this ultimate redemption has to be shelved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is indifferent to Richard. He didn't make deep blue roars to make something, but simply wanted to make a real sixth-order structure, starting with the most original materials, and this time the substrate processing was his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after Richard re-read his own production process, he found that the difficulty of completing the deep blue sigh for Su Hailun will not be much easier than making a new dark blue roar. There was a feeling of pain and quick intertwining in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After combing the power of his two real names from beginning to end, Richard went out of the lab and went to the underground warehouse to extract sacrifices, ready to go to eternity and time. Dragon's Dragon Temple sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacrifice is very important to Richard. He needs to see what is special at the higher level to deal with the Abyss. The horrible man at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of Richard is directly to the first level of grace, because he has a complete skeleton of the devil's big lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many times, the Eternal Dragon Hall has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar will not be destroyed in the torrent of time, although the appearance is broken ruins, but I am afraid it is the highest value ruins. Standing in front of the altar of time, Richard suddenly thought, if the sacrificial altar itself was sacrificed, what would happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course just an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was thinking about it, the night elf warriors were carrying in a box of magical boxes and placed them on the ground. During the period when Richard was absent, the points system gave the Archimonde family a net profit of more than 50 top sacrifices. This time, Richard brought all the sacrifices and prepared to turn them all into realistic combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, all the sacrifices were put on, and the night elves retired. Richard walked up to the altar and activated the space bracelet. The body of a demon lord appeared on the altar of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden time light curtain fell, and the altar restored its appearance hundreds of millions of years ago. In the void, the enormous will of the Eternal and Time Dragon is unexpected. Coming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard first said: "The great eternal and time dragon, I hope that this sacrifice will satisfy you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the altar, the bones of the devil's great lord are gradually turning into the power of time, gathering in the torrent of time in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the eternal and timeless dragon sounds directly in the consciousness of Richard: "You brought a rich offering and did not live up to my expectations of you." Now, put all the sacrifices on the altar, and then say your wishes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no hesitation, will be a full 50 top ceremonies The goods were all placed on the altar, watching them turn into the power of time, and then said: "I met an invincible person at the bottom of the Abyss, I want to know who that person is, his power Source, is there a way to defeat him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar of time, the dragon of eternal and time is omnipotent. Richard recalled the process of the day, and the eternal and the dragon of time knew the whole process at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Abyss Abyss is a special place. It is the deepest part of the world. It is also the channel connecting the light and the dark. It is my light that shines. The place. So I can't give you special advice in the battle there, even if there is, it won't be what you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of time Gathered into a ball of light, floating in front of Richard. Richard tried to reach out and touched and immediately knew the content of the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gives omniscience: Abyss abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to a comprehensive introduction to the Abyss abyss, this omniscience is accompanied by a small number of rules of the Abyss abyss, which can be said to be worthless. But the price of this grace is equally expensive, which is actually a second-level grace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been offering sacrifices for so long, that is, I have received the second level of grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The omniscience of such a direct addition of rules is indeed worth the money. But the problem is that Richard is not an ordinary strongman. The analytical rules are precisely his strongest and the fundamental guarantee of his strength. After an abyss, Richard’s understanding of the rules of the Abyss abyss is still above this God-given omniscience, and there is no need for such a second-level grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as the Eternal and Time Dragon said, this is not what Richard needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the rejection of the testimony, and the dragon of eternal and time has collected God's omniscience, and then several light balls of gods have gradually formed. This time is the real grace, waiting for Richard to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the graceful light ball is particularly slow. It is necessary to know that Richard sacrificed a total of fifty top ceremonies, plus a complete devil lord, but he also got the three gods of the region, and he could only choose one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these three balls of light are different only by their appearance. Their color is biased towards white gold, and there is a gold-like flow in the water, Richard I have never seen even a similar ripple in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to touch the ball of light and was immediately shocked! These three are the first level of grace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light ball is a shield inside, it has an ancient wild color, with the animal bone as a support, the surface is covered with a layer of animal skin. This kind of leather shield is extremely rough, but it is included in the first level of grace. Richard could not help but unfold his explanatory text and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal barriers. This shield is actually made of a powerful beast god, and the animal skin on it does not seem to be large. It is actually made of the whole beast skin. This shield uses the power of space and rules as the main means of defense, and can resist attacks equivalent to the general rules of the world, or the rules of the bottom plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the strength of the force that Richard has touched so far, it is the main shell of the Reaper’s main ship, and it still does not break the shield’s defense. In other words, if you hide behind the eternal barrier, then the attack of most of the super strong players in Noland will be helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
