Richard said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, looking at Richard intricately, he sighed deeply and said, "I know that you don’t know anything, this is what really makes me The place, among us, only you are really favored, because the teacher does not want you to carry anything, so I chose not to tell you anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Forget it, the teacher didn't say anything to you, I won't talk too much. When you are really strong in the future, you will naturally know that this time the teacher's enemy has been driven away by me, but I am just lucky. Finally, I escaped the space crack. Now I have to go back to the place where I came to be able to save this life. The recovery will be very long, so during this time, the dark blue can only rely on you, you don’t feel like yourself. Can you carry the dark blue back? Now you have a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Li is still calm, but his heart is shocked. He and his early hands have been hands-on. I saw how the forcible closed shadow army entered in the beginning. The portal of the world has also killed countless shadow creatures. Such a powerful beginning, only driving Su Hailun’s enemies away, has paid the price of almost death, so what is the enemy he faces? To the point, but think about it too. If it is not strong, how can you dare to become the enemy of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Richard noticed the heavy burden of the dark blue, and now it’s too early to block the first crisis of dark blue for him, then the second time And for the third time, who will help him, operating the dark blue, it is not as simple as a little money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard said: "I...do my best." He can no longer speak rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at your luck." At the beginning, he shook his head and said, "But you have to be careful, I didn't put a heavy hand on him. He The injury will not be too serious, and it may not be long before it will reappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nodded heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, well, I should have left, it’s good to be able to see such a beautiful ice floe bay." I stood up at the beginning and finally saw it. At a glance at the deep blue and ice floes, he raised his hand and tore open the space. He walked into the crack of the space and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not witness the arrival of the early days, but was once again shocked by the way he left. At the beginning of the sudden death, there was actually the ability to directly cross the plane. Richard suddenly felt that he was still a true strong world. Nothing to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the beginning of the walk, Richard stood quietly at the top of the dark blue, and tried to appreciate the ice floe. After a moment, he shook his head and walked down. At the top, the beginning is too early, and Richard is Richard. Each has its own style. Although it was strong at the beginning, Richard did not feel the need to imitate him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard summoned all the great magisters in the dark blue, asked in detail how the dark blues worked and the potential dangers, and the process continued. Most of the day, because the deep blue is really big enough and complicated enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thorough discussion, Richard decided to increase the number of gold coins that support the deep blue operation every year to eight million, and arrange to hire a deep blue inside to have a talent for construction. The mage draws the components, and finally the magi mentors closely monitor the movements of the various ethnic groups in the polar continent to prevent the gray dwarves and the orcs from looting. When necessary, Richard is also preparing to send the knights to defend against the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Richard to arrange the affairs in the dark blue, suddenly a master rushed to the conference room, regardless of the sitting inside are highly respected big devil The instructors, directly called: "The general of Richard, the letter from the Holy Alliance Royal Family, is the highest level of urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest level of dispatch, this All of a sudden, all the great magicians in the conference room began to whisper, and Richard was also amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of urgent grade corresponds to a major event such as the total war between the six empires of Noland, and what is related to Richard. It is worthwhile for the Alliance Royals to summon with such high-level dispatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly took the envelope from the Master and entered the royal magic seal, which was completely impossible to forge. After opening the envelope, the letter first shot a magic. Fluctuation in Li, the body of the letter was suddenly burned, and a magical light ball instantly fell into the eyebrows of Richard, sending a large amount of information into the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly read the message and his face gradually became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Holy Alliance royal family urgently summoned Richard for the absolute battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusk, perhaps it was the spur of Philip’s unrivaled capture of the rising sun. Just a few days ago, a large number of Dakso Das strongs suddenly poured into the dusk. Also included are an unknown number of legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Daksodas superpowers have also entered the rising sun, and have played a few battles with Philip, but they have not won, but they The challenge also succeeded in keeping the Alliance Emperor Philippe in the rising sun, when other Dakso Das strongmen flocked to the other three legions of Noland, preparing to take one of them. Shame before the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the total of four military missions in Noland, the day-end capital, which is mainly stationed by the Holy Alliance, is now the weakest guard, naturally The target of the key attack of the Kosodas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the military newspaper sent back from the front line, the number of Dax Sodas who have recently appeared around the sun and the capital has increased dramatically, and the corresponding day does not fall. The number of fallen people has also risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Daksodas almost came out of the nest, it is said that one-third of the super-powers of the entire plane gathered in the dusk. If you consider that the superpowers travel most of the time on the plane and don't do nothing to stay in this position, the ratio is extremely scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, not only the Holy Alliance, the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire also issued the highest level of summoning orders, summoning the strongmen belonging to the Empire to the dusk Assist in guarding the military fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the three great empires, the Holy Alliance originally had shortcomings at the level of the strong because of the short time and lack of foundation, and it occupied two The pressure on the fortress of the Legion can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakso Das’s attack is still only in the exploratory stage, once they are confirmed that the defense of the Legion’s fortress is the worst, it will inevitably attack. In the land of dusk, Dakosodas enjoy great freedom of movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is not the crisis of Noland in the dusk, but the biggest crisis in the history of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the situation in the dusk is out of control, the human empire can actually seek help from the three empires established by other races, and even seek help from the elves of the dying enemy The cost, according to unwritten practices, is the need to give up a military fortress in the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress of the extermination battlefield itself has no value, but its true meaning is the benchmark that stands in the hearts of the top powers of the entire plane. It is the highest glory and dignity of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard remembered a famous history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Elf Empire entered the decline period, the major races did not dare to incite, and then the Elf Empire repeatedly defeated in another field battlefield. Lost six important strongholds in a row, leaving only the last portal. The swordsman of the ecstasy army is about to plug in the land of Noland, but the elf empire is still arrogant and treats each The great race is as rude as it used to be, and it has finally aroused the anger of all ethnic groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One race suddenly announced that they were separated from the rule of the Elven Empire, they were independent, and formed a coalition, and there were several battles with the Elven Empire, and the elf Empire near the decline In the north, the emperor finally had to declare the recognition of the independence of the various ethnic groups and open up the right to participate in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the strong powers of all ethnic groups flooded into the extremist battlefield, and in the next ten years, they won a battle at the expense of blood and soul. Another place where the Elven Empire lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of various ethnic groups, this war was called the battle of dignity, and it was also the beginning of the fall of the elf empire. After the independence of the various tribes, the territory of the elf empire decreased. More than half of the time, while the elites of all ethnic groups quickly grew up through the tempering and harvesting of the battlefields on the ground, the superiority of the Elven Empire at the level of the strong also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a crazy era, don’t say the ordinary sanctuary, even the 16th and 7th-level warriors and magicians are madly pouring into the battlefield, choose Wherever the path of the sanctuary was achieved, a small number of people did succeed, but the vast majority remained in the land forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a war that does not count on gains and losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as an unspoken unspoken rule, the performance of the major empire in the field of extinction is the most direct proof of national strength, if forced to seek help from the outsiders That is the shame that takes hundreds of years to wash away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard was recruited as a royal architect. The Holy Alliance hopes that he can stay in the capital of the day, but the main task is not Fighting, but playing the role of St. Lawrence in the past, to create, supplement and repair the structure for the strong, there is Richard, the overall strength of the strong can be slowly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
