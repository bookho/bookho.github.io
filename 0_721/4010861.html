			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack comes from the ogre lord, waiting for the timing of the pull Mi Su finally seized the opportunity and jumped up, and the volley gave him a heavy blow on his knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant knees on the ground, hard to force, finally pressed by the mother nest on the ground, a pair of blades deep into his neck, mouth open, 狠He bites his face to the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biting sound of the teeth is intertwined with the painful screams of the giants. The blade and mouthpiece of the nest are unimaginable sharps, no matter what. Anything can be easily pierced and bitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took a little breath, then suddenly rushed, the figure flicked around the giant who fell to the ground, and even after seven flashes, it was transmitted hundreds of meters away. The giant body immediately bloomed seven blood flowers, and a huge wound of two meters square appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times of the teleport attack, Richard’s face was pale and not too expensive. He drank a few bottles of healing potion while waiting for the magic to recover. A new order was given to His Majesty's followers and the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred knights were pulled out, they rushed to the giant, and then controlled the magic ride with a superb ride, sprinting at a small angle, and then long The long rifle pierced the giant's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the full force of vindictiveness, every shot penetrates, and the surrounding flesh and blood will explode violently, and the knights will change direction by the reaction of the spurs. Going far away, far away from the circle, and then re-accelerating the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant body began to bloom incessantly, and the knights were like a wave of waves, constantly slap the giant body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest finally exerted its strength and size advantage, pressed him firmly under his body, and while he was biting, he would always spit out Toxic acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色,水花, and Zonghu were transferred to fill the gap left by the knights, killing the barbarian warriors, when faced with the giants, they appeared More skills than enough to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Richard has a double artifact in his hand, there is a terrible effect of life. It takes a lot of effort to reinvent such a big guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant waved his hand and suddenly took it. The sudden blow made the six knights into bolognese, but this was his last struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less force to clamp, the hen’s nest immediately screams, completely overwhelming the giant, biting his throat, tearing it, letting the deadly wound become Deeper and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vitality of the giant is surprisingly long, struggling for a long time before finally dying, but the hands and feet will be affected by the nerves without all necrosis, instinctively twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mother's nest retreats, the giant becomes a huge skeleton with only about half of the flesh and blood on the body, and a large number of bodies become shadows and gradually dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relies on some mysterious and powerful force to transform energy into a semi-essential body. Now, after dying, the power of the body is lost and imprisoned. The energy changes back to its original form and is scattered into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao fell on the chest of the giant, using his moonlight to open his chest, revealing a heart bigger than Richard's whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This heart is blue-gray, it will pulsate for a long time, but it hides the power of the fire, enough to support the operation of such a huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this heart, Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from the energy contained, the value of this heart is not inferior to the heart of the mountain lord, this is a top-level sacrifice, you can do With the stuff of raw materials, Richard has completed a little more control of the battle version of Midrand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha carefully examines several key parts of the heart and finally determines that the giant does have Titan's lineage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a powerful life like this should not appear in Faro, its existence has exceeded the carrying capacity of the plane, and a full blow is enough to trigger the plane. The instability of the spatial structure, of course, will also be the case when Richard uses the real name to destroy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battles in the periphery are still going on. The barbarian zombie warriors don’t know what to fear, and they don’t know what to retreat. But when two hundred knights join the battle, they are only dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last barbarian warrior was cut down, Richard recovered the Scarlet Sacrifice and the Elf Prophet. He landed on the giant's heart and began to seal with magic. The activity of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage and priests have also climbed the giant's body and began to study the organs and flesh and bones. A large number of worker bees have also appeared. They are the best workers and assistants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great value of the giant is not only the heart, but also the treasures of the whole body, especially the huge and complete skeleton. If Richard has enough ambition and resources, You can even refine an unprecedented giant cockroach. By contrast, those barbarian warriors have almost no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant is too big to fully recycle, even if Richard brings a thousand worker bees, and there are many builders to help, it also needs nearly three The day of the day, the biggest project is to separate the skeleton and seal it, use the alchemy to reduce the volume, and then save it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not idle, he is in the temporary construction of the laboratory, examining the body of a barbarian warrior, shortly after the death of these barbarians, The body showed signs of rapid aging. In a day, they were like old people for decades, but their ** was surprisingly without any signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Richard has a bottle of translucent yellow liquid in his hand, which is what prevents the barbarian rot from decaying, according to his test. The age difference between these barbarian warriors is astonishingly large, some are close to the millennium, and some are only thirty or fifty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect is the yellow liquid, which is a very powerful preservative that can replace blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee carefully looked at it for a while, put down the glass bottle in the handle and continued the inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood with antiseptic effect is only one aspect. What is really important is the powerful energy hidden in the body of the barbarian. This is the energy close to the origin of the plane. It is very pure, it is its existence, so that the barbarian warrior has the power far beyond the natural limit, and can maintain activities and maintain simple wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard has a vague conjecture, but further verification is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not unexpected, all answers will be revealed at the heart of the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This barbarian zombie army is extremely powerful and can sweep almost half of Faro, if not Richard is a legendary mage and sage from Noland Installed, the army assembled in the initial attack is equivalent to the regular military strength of the entire three underlying floating island giants. I am afraid it is difficult to deal with this giant and barbarian zombie army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the initial place, there is such a huge hidden power, and it is no wonder that people who have sneaked in private for so many years have gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the giant's remains were processed, the mother's nest also used this time to initially repair its own insects, and Richard once again set foot on the mother's nest to lead the scale. The army, which was not big, but extremely powerful, rose to the sky and flew to the depths of the initial place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full day of flight, in the encounter with more than a dozen sporadic barbarian zombie warriors, Richard finally found hidden deep in the initial place The secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shallow and gentle valley, nestled in a low mountain, although the mountain is less than a kilometer, but in an infinite initial place It seems very awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley finally saw the barbarian, there are more than a dozen villages, and Richard also saw a large number of lush fields, which grow abnormally and do not belong at all. The crops of this season are full of vitality in the entire valley, even too strong, that is, the Greenson plane is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard fell on the hill, the mountains were all black rocks, and a few huge cracks were constantly sprayed with large steam, at the foot of the mountain. There are more than a dozen large and small caves, and there are always barbarians in and out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard suddenly burst into a groan, and he heard the great heartbeat in the midst of it. This time it was clearer, the sound was more durable, and it provoked Richard’s The three hearts beat together, almost letting him spurt out of his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and confused, immediately condensed his will and forced the heartbeat away from consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
