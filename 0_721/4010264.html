If Richard leads the army, then the royal army will inevitably lose, but it is unlikely to be defeated by the entire army. The invaders can come across the plane, and they must be murderous. It is strange that the coalition forces win if they win. Otherwise, the gods will not have to jointly release the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expressions of the two dukes, Richard said: "Now, we have assembled more than 50,000 troops, and the other party has only 13,000. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard reached out and pointed his finger at the foot, and showed a strong self-confidence, saying: "So I am going to call them all back to my hometown, Here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow relaxed and said, "Maybe this time, there is no need for the gods to intervene."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." The Duke of the Wolf also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatars of the gods are not without cost. Let’s not say that the ritual requires a source of mass belief, how many believers may be sacrificed, and only the avatar of God is directly The advent of the region, due to the moment carrying a powerful force, its impact will be manifested in the next few years to decades, or climate variability, or the baby birth rate is abnormal, so the total. If the ancestors of the advent of the region are worshipped by the ancestors, they will even weaken the connection between the ancestral spirit and the family. For some unspeakable considerations, the adventurous areas of the incarnations will always be near the powerful family of a ancestor worship. And the incarnation of the gods, the battle power may not be stronger than the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow calculated the time and said: "It seems that the final battle will be with the invaders after five days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Richard shook his head and said, "No, the war has begun tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hundred kilometers away On a plain, a dense camp was erected. The battlefields not far from each other are still filled with blood, and the night-night crows waiting for the big meal are squatting in the sky, making people upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is still walking in the camp as usual, and greets the familiar soldiers on the road from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for leading this unit is not long, but he has been able to name many people. But the wind tonight was a bit cold, and Raymond could not help but wrap the cloak. He has recently felt more and more weak in the body, but there is always a flame burning in his chest, burning his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Raymond, there was a separate camp, and there was a constant scream and scream. Here is the wounded battalion. The soldiers who can lie here are hopeful to save and can continue to fight. The soldiers who were seriously injured and dying were already painfully terminated by their comrades when they were cleaning the battlefield. Although the injury is not dead, it will leave soldiers who are disabled and unable to continue fighting. They will be thrown away and let them find their own destination in a strange plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond walked in the wounded battalion, and his heart was filled with pain. "If you can have a priest, you can do it even if it is a pastor!" This thought came to his mind involuntarily. In the past, Raymond has not known how many times it has been painful. Today, it only repeats the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are sacred officers, thousands of seriously wounded soldiers can stand up again and pick up their shields and swords again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond comforted the next wounded soldier waiting for the bandage, walked out of the camp, stood in the night wind and calmed down a little swollen mind, and shook his head hard. It seemed that he wanted to expel the screams from behind him. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the hooves sounded, and a general came to him. He jumped off the horse in front of Raymond and said, "Rimon is an adult, the prisoner has already After the inventory was completed, there were a total of 14,000 people, including two thousand wounded soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s heart was another tremble, and it came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his face was still calm, reaching for the map of Faro, looking at the situation ahead of the marching route, and then casting it to the general. A glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a general of the Joseph family and has been with Raymond for many years. In the plane battle, the two have had a great victory together, and there are almost times when they are in desperate circumstances. The general has never lost confidence in Raymond, and Raymond knows that no matter what is handed over to him, he will be able to execute his ideas almost perfectly, without fear of deviations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the general’s face is still resolute, but there is a tiredness in the eyebrows, and the sweat and blood on his face have not been cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s heart sighs, and wants to bring these warriors who have been loyal to themselves alive, and there is no room for kindness. He has seen the blood of too many plane wars, but the cruelty of this expedition Faro still exceeds Raymond's imagination. It was only two big battles in two days, and his troops lost more than half. Among them, more than 5,000 soldiers died because they were not treated by the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked up and said in front of everyone around him, "We have no way to take care of the prisoners. All the prisoners are treated in the way we did yesterday." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was expressionless and said faintly: "You can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the thunder Most of the generals around Meng have rich experience in plane warfare, but when they hear Raymond’s orders, there are still people who can’t bear the color, and there are some strange things to see Raymond’s eyes. Everyone here knows that the so-called yesterday's way is to kill all the prisoners. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond knew that his army was hundreds of kilometers away from the plane of the plane, and immediately decided not to take prisoners, and gave up all the power that could not restore combat power. Injured soldiers, the army marched at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These orders were all issued by Raymond in public. Although everyone knows the cruelty of the plane war, they all know that there is no retreat in this trip. Only the grab of the plane is the initial victory. But people will always have some strange ideas about those who dare to make such orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanding general hurried away, and after a moment, the screams rang through the night sky. The bloody suffocation under the night became more and more intense, attracting a large greedy night crow, regardless of the human camp underneath, and circling lower and lower, once and for all, even if there was an archer who was intolerant, shot a few Only, they just let them fly higher, but they refused to disperse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond returned to his camp after a round of medical camp and lay down to rest. There will be a full day of marching tomorrow, and there may be three or five small-scale battles. Without enough physical strength, he can't support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night sky is high, a few bats are squatting, unlike ordinary bats, their blood-red eyes are actually sharp. Tens of kilometers away, the brains of a small mother's nest are hovering in the air, receiving all the images from the elite bats, and then passing them on to the distant Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard was moving from the stone tower to his own camp. He has seen through the eyes of the elite bats that Raymond’s camp is gradually quiet. After a day of war, the elite warriors will feel fatigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Li Cha Shen Shen Shui, the consciousness is moving. In the rocky forest ten kilometers away from the Raymond camp, Hula’s flapping sounds, and one feather and one snake flew from the rock, opened the wings and flew to Raymond’s military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers that are dominated by sky blue and dark green are flying higher and higher. When they approach the camp, they flatten their wings and glider over the military camp. They fly high, and the flight is almost silent, even if it is a little bit of the sound of the wings, it is covered by a group of night owls that have not been exhausted. Therefore, the sentinels who only focused on preventing land-based enemies did not notice that the danger was actually approaching in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feathers began to position in the sky, pulling each other very open, flying over the military camp from all angles, and then continuously squirting large groups from the mouth Poisonous fog. The wet heavy toxic mist slowly drifted from the air. After hundreds of poisonous feather snakes spewed back and forth a few toxic mists, only one sentinel looked up by accident, so he snorted and pointed at the air: "That's good. Like something is flying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sentry sent a glance at it and said, "It’s just this plane. Birds and beasts, probably attracted by bloody smell? No need to care too much, optimistic about your position. Your eyes are not used to look into the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But I think they seem to be spitting something." The young sentinel argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's your eyes spent!" The old sentinel felt that his dignity was being provoked. According to his experience, those who dare to hover over the army barracks are animals with no brains. The magician can sweep the sky clean with a magic. Moreover, during the day, everyone was bothered by the group of night owls who couldn’t kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sentinel disputes alarmed the captain on duty, and he walked into the post and said coldly: "What are you arguing? Don't you know the rules?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, look!" The young sentinel pointed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain looked in the direction of his finger. His eyesight was far superior to that of ordinary warriors. His face suddenly changed: "Feather snake! Damn, this is not a beast." But World of Warcraft! Oh, no, they are spraying! Quickly sounding the alarm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm broke the silence of the night, the military camp immediately boiled, the clothes The lying soldiers rushed out of the tent directly. In a blink of an eye, a long arrow that shone with magical light flew into the sky, and almost a dozen feather snakes fell straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, most feather snakes have already sprayed the poison sac, and immediately began to retreat in accordance with the orders of Richard. The poisonous fog of the large regiment was slowly falling from the sky to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some warriors began to feel blurred in front of their eyes, breathing became difficult, and then the strength of the whole body was like being evacuated, and even holding the weapons was difficult. The frail warrior fell directly to the ground. The hardest hit was the wounded barracks, where the poisonous fog was so thick that it could see the blue-green fog almost every few tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great mentor who came out of the camp was shocked and immediately used two highly efficient reels to release more than a dozen winds. This is the only way to completely scatter the poisonous mist that hangs over the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
