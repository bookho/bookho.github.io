			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side of Gotton, is a tall woman. The appearance is very bright, a long red hair like a jumping flame, flying through her shoulders between her eyes, thick lips revealing the unspoken sex. She is wearing a deep red mage robe, and the rich elemental atmosphere flowing on it shows that this is a rare robes, which has a powerful additive effect on fire magic. Just like the ordinary robe style, the neckline of this robe is particularly low, revealing a large snow white chest muscle and two bulging hemispheres. Few wizards are so sexy, but she is a real master, and the elemental atmosphere of her body is also indicative of her identity as a great magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her chest cleavage, there is a vivid black, one end and one tail occupy the majority of the two hemispheres. In this place, a black dragon with such a realistic look is summoning the attention of all male animals. Richard's gaze was naturally attracted to it, but when his eyes were exposed on the black dragon ornament, it was a glimpse. This black dragon tattoo is actually a magical structure with an unclear purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have sensed Richard’s gaze, and the woman suddenly smiled and looked at Richard, screaming at him, and quietly throwing a kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina! That is my son. If you dare to start with him, don't blame me." Even though Goto looked down at the magic map from beginning to end, However, it seems that she has a panoramic view of her every move, and said that she is a female mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina laughed, and the crisp laughter was particularly pleasant in Listening to Richard’s ear, and it had a strange charm that made Richard There is no reason to feel very close to her, and even some ** topics do not mind to talk to her. Her laughter gradually filled her ears, and Richard's boiling blood was rushing, so the male instinct began to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina blinked and said, "Master, your son is also very good. It seems that everything is understood. If it is he wants to come." Looking for me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon laughed: “If you can hook him up, instead of using your talent, then I don’t care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina laughed again and sent a big kiss to Richard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard couldn’t help but be red, so it was the first time that a woman was teased in public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was at a loss, Lina suddenly appeared a young and handsome man with a sunny face and a pair of blue eye. This man is not tall, but slightly thin and thin, and his height seems to be even shorter than Richard. It should be less than one meter eight. He wore ordinary aristocratic youth uniforms, and the textures were all moderate, and they were the same as the styles, that is, they were not particularly gorgeous, and they were not very simple. They could not see any special equipment and could not feel the power of the whole body. In fact, his sense of existence was surprisingly small. When he looked at Lina, Richard even completely ignored his existence. This is a bit surprising. Even if there is the undisputed beauty and natural temptation of Lina, it can be hidden before Richard's real insight. There is no special secret, that is, the absolute gap in the power level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man saw the surprise of Richard, so he smiled and said, "Hello, little Richard. My name is Serdong, the walker of the dark world." But don't get me wrong, I am not a killer, but a more popular profession, no matter which city you are in, you may encounter a career: a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thief?" Richard was really surprised, almost called out the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s absolutely terrible that it’s only to be able to converge in front of him and avoid his perception. How could it be just a thief? Such strength, if you really want to be a thief, I am afraid that people under the Sanctuary and the Magister will be completely stolen by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, being able to stand in this hall and study magic maps with Gordon is enough to illustrate his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Richard saw four strange people and also met four of the thirteen knights who joined the volcano with Gotton: Dark Pastor Achilles, Dragon Master Lina, violent boxing fighter Wald, and strange thief Seldon. As for Mordred, I have known each other. But when anyone enters the command hall, he will always see Gotton. Although he does not give off any power, it will naturally become the focus of all sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon wrinkled his eyebrows and swept it over the face of the four knights. He pointed to a town sign on the magic map and said, "This time the army was Li Na led, within fifteen days, I want to see you arrive at the castle, and I will hear your good news within 30 days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lina first cheered, then she exclaimed again: "No! It will arrive in fifteen days? God, then I am not getting it right now, I am not going to hurry! Master, you are intentionally right, afraid. I put your little Licha to bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting for Gordon to answer, Wald said with a metal voice: "You Don't want to go? That's right, I am going! For a long time, there is no activity. This castle defense is very powerful. Only me can be attacked by a siege expert. Lina is wasting time!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina immediately yelled angrily: "You are nonsense! When can I not attack? This castle can withstand my Salenberg Do you want to find a place to try one first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde licked his lips and sneered and said: "Play and fight! You Really when I am afraid of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! Gordon tapped the stone platform, and Lina and Wald quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina, can't you go?" Gotton asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go! Of course!" Lina was almost shouting. With her movements, the two hemispheres on the chest are also beating vigorously, and it seems that they will completely get rid of the corsage at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to hurry up, leaving you with a preparation time of at most half a day." Gotton reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina was shocked, first glanced at Wald, then took a deep look at Richard, and then took a fragrant wind from Richard Walked around and left the command hall. She really didn't dare to delay at any time, because as soon as she opened the bronze door in the command hall, she stood in the corridor and opened a portal and crossed in. If the big magician wants to use the eight-level portal, the cost is still very large, which means that the combat power is weakened by a quarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon once again in a canyon, said to Wald: "I will give you fifteen construction knights, and must occupy this seat within ten days." The commanding heights on both sides of the canyon cannot be put on one ride during Lina's siege."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
