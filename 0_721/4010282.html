The animal claw necklace can be sacrificed as an accident. There is only one choice of God, but it is also an accident. Even the lowest level of sacrifice usually gives two options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the discovery of the touch of grace, the ball of light broke down on its own, and the long sword inside fell on the altar and bounced a few times. It fell to Richard's feet and fell into two sections, falling from the back of the sword and a shorter blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stunned, this is the gift of God's gift, looking at the power of the time just approaching the high sacrifice, this sword is not a legend There are some weapons that cannot be said. The result is how bad it is to fall, even the ordinary long sword is not as good as? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly picked up the long sword and the falling fragments, and took a closer look at the hand, only to find that the sword can actually be divided into two paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weapon similar to a straight knife. The straight edge, the blade and the back of the knife are irregularly serrated near the handshake. The back of the sword can be dismantled and turned into a short sword. Look at the thick and thick edge of the short sword, like a cone-shaped blade, more to play the role of armor. This sword is made of special material, not metal, but it is made of a creature's claws or bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard grasped the grip of the short-blade sword, both hands and hands were hurt at the same time, and were pierced by a bone that was quietly protruding. Blood is absorbed into it. On the blade of the short-blade sword, a dark red light was swept at the same time, and then the blade appeared a touch of green, and the whole body began to reveal a murderous murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the description of this grace is emerging in the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abomination of massacres, the murder of the blood of the sacrificer, the quasi-artifact, the super-armor, the bleeding, the tearing of the wound, the four attributes of wind speed. It has extra damage power to the race that the sacrificer is currently most hated. The most hated race for the sacrificial is the Calando barbarian. So this weapon is renamed the Barbarian Slaughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carando Barbarian? What is the most hated race of the sacrificial present? This answer made Richard feel ashamed, his enemies are numerous, never thought of who hates the most. But think about it, it is true. At the thought of the destiny of the arrival of the mountains and the sea on the agreed date, Richard would have an unparalleled hatred of the barbaric tradition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the future, when Richard re-enters Caledon, this abhors and slaughter is indispensable. But in this case, isn't Richard Lee carrying three knives and a staff to go to Calando? He just outlined it in his mind and immediately annihilated his imagination. Then came a strange idea, should I go to find a space container that can store weapons and equipment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard was on a headache, a follow-up explanation of the grace was revealed in the consciousness: "The emergence of this weapon comes from the claws of ancient behemoths. But obviously, it is much stronger and more precious than the claws of ancient behemoths, from any angle. Any sacrifice from Calando can get more and more grace, what else is needed Hesitant? In addition, there is not much time for the Calando sacrifice to receive extra grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard once again stunned, what is this explanation? It seems to be some kind of persuasion. Then a thought automatically jumped into the mind, and Richard immediately remembered the string of beasts on his wrist. It is said that the tooth in the middle is really from the beast, so it is one of the five holy objects of the Daxueshan Temple. I just didn't expect that the mountains and the sea were thrown to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard did not sacrifice the teeth of the beast, now there is another shell from the mountain and the sea, then he certainly has more Will not sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and easily rejected the temptation of the eternal and timeless dragon, ending the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the power of time dissipated, the sound of the eternal and the dragon of the time, the mechanical sound of the sky, sounded in the temple: "People, because you are persevering Sacrifice, already qualified for the eternal and timeless dragon, you get the title of Time Traveler, from which the power of light will continue to wash your body and mind. Your body's aging speed will be reduced a little. You need to continue to be humble, and after ten top sacrifices, you will get more care, and the rambler will be your next title."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Richard, this is a real surprise. The slowing down of body aging is equal to prolonging life in disguise. This is a godsend that has little use at the moment, but it has a huge role in the long run. As a result, there are many expectations for the more advanced plane ramblers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain of time is gone, Vatican is standing in the hall, looking at Richard with a smile, all the eyes are commendation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came over, Vatican said: "You are very good, able to seize the only chance and be able to refuse temptation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this sentence, Richard’s first reaction was a cold sweat. He almost didn't resist the temptation of the dragon of eternal and time, and it was only once that he was given the opportunity to assign grace. But now Richard understands that in the face of temptation, people will unconsciously exaggerate the opportunity to get the same thing next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Richard paid a courtesy to Vatican and said, "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now finally understands that it is not that easy for Vatican to insert an option to assign grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin smiled softly and said, "Okay, don't thank me. I don't have any pursuit now. What do you want so much? Why are you young?" Don't embark on the old road of our time because of the impulse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard nodded heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said again: "Okay, let's go out. The royal family has arrived, they just brought the magic material you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer hall of the Eternal Dragon Hall, a middle-aged aristocrat in a royal suit is walking back and forth. The deal was too big, and the deputy director of the Royal Treasury came in person. The lord who has the title of the court count, although he has a lot of knowledge in his life, has never experienced several tens of millions of transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the arrival of Richard, he immediately greeted him, piled up his sincere smile and greeted him. Although the court count has no friendship with Richard, his smile is with the identity and family of the other. There is no need to say much about Richard’s identity, and there is clearly a tendency for the net worth to go beyond identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the court’s count, five words of a magic box with one person high were placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee opened one by one, the magic box is divided into dozens of layers, each layer can be opened, and the magic materials are placed in an orderly manner. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of trouble, an item is carefully examined. He is too familiar with these magical materials. With wisdom and real talent, you can distinguish the type, weight and texture with a glance. Even so, Richard checked all the materials and spent nearly half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court count on one side is not impatient. A million-dollar transaction, let alone half an hour, is to check for two days and two nights and he can wait safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the last box, Richard satisfactorily nodded and said: "The materials produced by the royal family are of excellent quality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of the Court was relieved. He also wanted to move his hands and feet on the material, even if it was slightly leaking from the finger joints, it was the benefit of tens of thousands of gold coins. However, Richard’s identity is special, and he dare not act in front of a royal architect. Seeing that Richard recognized the goods, he also breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Master Richard, can you test the sacrifice now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! "Lie said back to Nolan and said, "Grand priest, please identify it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan opened the offering box that Richard brought, waving Shooting a pale gold beam on the offering, looking at the reflected light, nodded and said, "Definitely a sacrifice that can hold a top sacrifice ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The court’s face was slightly excited, and he did not have much chance to see the top sacrifices up close. As for the sacrifice, there is no land like him, and there is no hope that the people of the sanctuary will not get a chance in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Nolan’s great officer closed the box, sealed it with a magical spell, and branded his name. In this way, anyone who wants to get a sacrifice will inevitably destroy the seal she left behind. This is necessary to prevent collateral from being damaged or being dropped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction was successfully completed. Richard temporarily stored all the magic materials in the Eternal Dragon Hall, and then talked with Nolan about the minerals brought back from Faro. All of Richard originally wanted Magic Crystal, but now he is ready to redeem a million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of gold coins?" Nolan was surprised. For people like her, the gold coin is completely cumbersome, and the magic crystal can absorb it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "I have to send gold coins to followers and their subordinates!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Have you not paid for them before?" Nolan was also surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I used to dress up for them." Richard looked sly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s face is green and his mood is green. He wants to blast Lee directly. She is a very direct person, and she did it when she thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hated by Nolan, but he still didn’t understand where he had offended her. But when Richard had just left the Eternal Dragon Hall, he hurried back and stood in front of the Nolan Grand Gods, and piled up a brilliant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
