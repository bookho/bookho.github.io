			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a line of defense, the next thing is simple, Richard is just After a fire wall disappears, a new fire wall is added. When there is a time left, a fireball is placed on the souls in the depths of the hall to weaken their power. Behind Richard, Tiramisu also mechanically placed the most extensive fireball on the undead. The magic power of the cannibalist can only be said to be general, but the magic reserve is unusually large. He can easily put twenty or thirty on the third-level fireball. Sandro was not idle, and he continued to release the magic of the undead command to the more advanced undead captain. Sandu’s mental power is extremely strong, so the success rate of this five-level magic is as high as 80%. Once in the order of his undead, those who are up to the 14th level will be controlled by the Necromancer. The Necromancer will manipulate them to stand in the fire wall of Richard, and the thirty seconds of control time is enough to make these high-level undead burned to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the large group of undead, the unicorn spurts the nose and sprays a white mist from the nostrils. The white mist spreads rapidly. When it comes into contact with the undead, it will roll like a boiling water, and then turn the undead into nothing. The white mist it sprays has a very strong effect, and the same volume of white mist can neutralize the undead atmosphere ten times. In a twinkling of an eye, the unicorn became light and cloudy within ten meters. Richard and followers were all within the scope of the unicorn. Only Sandrud was hiding outside, carefully not letting the white fog Close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Iowa, who had been idle for nothing, finally decided to do something. He extended his hands and had a glorious ball of light between the palms. Then the light ball flew out of the hand and quickly swirled in the air. Each rotation of the ball would shoot dozens of thin beams around. As soon as these beams fall on the Necromancer, they will burn a dark hole. The powerful undead are all shot through the beam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light ball whirls, and the rain-like arrows shoot the undead. The ball of light quickly flew to the end of the hall, and then burst completely, bursting into a dazzling golden flame! For a time, the undead creatures at the end of the hall were swept away. The remaining undead is only a small half life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a seven-level magic, Richard has never heard of it, but the power is comparable to eight-level magic. Perhaps this is another unique demon of the fighting priest. After Io’s hand was revealed, everyone in the hall lost his voice. They are all shocked by this powerful and unparalleled magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha face sinking like water, I only feel that I haven’t played for a few days, and this kid’s troubles have been made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although under the double blow of magic and magic, the undead creatures were destroyed. However, the number of guards in the royal cemetery is clearly beyond the expectations of the people, and there are still undead guards coming out from the end of the passage. After estimating that the followers consumed half of the magic and divine power, Richard decided to retreat. The destruction of the dead is destroyed, while the magic and divine power can be regenerated. It is not a last resort, and Richard is not prepared to fight with these undead trolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha exited the royal cemetery and rested for one night. When everyone was in the best condition, he entered the royal cemetery again. This time, I finally went deep into the deepest part of the cemetery and met the four-level and fifteen-level royal family. Richard waved his hand forward, and the four senior undeads became ashes in the moment of magic and magical bombardment. Tiramisu and Gangde pushed open the bronze tomb door of the tomb. This kind of occasion that requires strength is the only place where Gangde has performed. All the way, he has been as hungry as the giant axe, but whether it is Richard, quicksand or Iraq, it is a metamorphosis that cannot be used by common sense. The brilliance of magic and magic all the way has never stopped, completely It is crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice is equally shocking to say no words. He only once entered the tomb of the king, and that was lucky enough to escape from the hands of the undead warriors, but these ectopic marauders came, and it was simply pushing all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the core burial chamber was pushed open. This is a giant burial chamber with a height of ten meters. There is a golden giant python on the central high platform. Under the golden shackles, there is a dark blue bronze soul jar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the cemetery of our greatest troll empire, Dracazan, only he is qualified...God!" The troll sacrifice suddenly screamed stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and others also saw that the cover of the golden plaque has been opened, and the shackles are empty. There is no body of the troll warlord at all. The atmosphere of the undead here is extremely rich, and the thick has become a dark gray mist, constantly spreading from the inside. If it is not the white fog of the unicorn, this is not the place where ordinary creatures can survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee let the sands bless himself with a death guard, walked in the cemetery, and finally stopped in front of the golden dragonfly and picked up the front Bronze Soul Jar, ask: "Is this one of the three holy devices of the storage tank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice has recovered from the great shock at this time, Nodded and said: "It is! It has been used exclusively by the Warlord. Until the death of the new Warlord, it will be used to store the soul of the next Warlord. It is said that the soul is stored here, and it can keep some of the memories of the life before reincarnation to the next. Ji."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took up the storage tank and looked at it carefully. The tank is engraved with many intricate patterns and ancient troll texts that together form a mysterious magical array. Richard has never seen a similar magical array, but can feel the tremendous power contained in the magical array. Unexpectedly, the original barbaric troll civilization can also design such a powerful magical array. And unlike Noland's complicated to the ultimate magical array, the troll-style magical array is simple, and a few strokes can achieve such powerful power, which is really amazing. Richard faintly felt that even if he didn't want anything, he would only understand the magical array on this storage tank, and it would be of great help to his level of construction. Perhaps many complex standard magic modules can be simplified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like the outside soul jar, the lid of this storage tank is also open, and it is empty. The soul of the Warlord does not know whether it is escaping or disappearing. But looking at the open golden plaque, you know that most of the former is the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha indulged in a moment and handed the storage tank to the troll sacrifice, saying: "It seems that the evil spirits are mostly related to the Warlord De Karazhan. Here There is nothing left. Let's take a rest and go to the temple tomorrow to see what the evil spirits are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifices a deep tribute to Richard With a storage tank, I will go out of the tomb first. Richard frowned, beckoning to call the all the way to the front, whispering in her ear: "You will stare at him after going out, if he has any strange movements, kill it immediately!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimpse of the water, said: "Is it only that he can seal the evil spirits in the storage tank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He shook his head and said: "There are seven or eight troll tribes nearby, and each tribe has at least one sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior Point Nodded. The neck of the troll sacrifice is not harder in her eyes than a dead wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good for nothing overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard, who returned to the troll camp, took the troops again and went to the shrine area on the top of Zhubwal. The temple is actually a ladder pyramid with a height of tens of meters. The top is built with an altar to worship Zukar. Flowing sand has deciphered all the contents of the slate and knows the steps of the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
