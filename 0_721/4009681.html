			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life in the dark blue is tense and regular, ignorant, Time slipped inadvertently. Richard is still Richard, and his life has not changed, only the monthly bills have begun to add a lot of inexplicable income, and 'Su Hai Lun's joy' is always the largest piece of income. Richard never understood how he made Su Helun 'joy', but every time he saw the bill, he would really feel the heavy gold content of the legendary wizard. At least one big magister wants such a 'joy', it will take a long time to go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Su Helun has been delighted, Richard has always been able to maintain balance. The magician cultivation needs a huge consumption that is unimaginable to ordinary people. It can be said that it is not exhausted. Moreover, the curriculum that Richard has recently changed, and the number of small-scale courses on his class has suddenly increased dramatically, except for the magical philosophy, mainland politics, and the introduction of alchemy. Entering the classroom at a specified time will reveal that there are only one student in certain subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means a good thing! At least Richard thinks so. Because each of the instructors of the class has a corresponding remuneration, and according to the prescribed remuneration is shared by all students in the class. Teaching alone means that Richard has to pay the full compensation of the tutor. Therefore, his monthly billing expenditure items are also rapidly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard found that after the first time the legendary Master was pleased, he was much more concerned by the people around him. Often people are pointing at him, passing by, encountering and even classmates, and then whispering. Richard’s perception is not strong enough to detect what they are talking about, and it doesn’t care. It was just the feeling of being concerned about this moment, but letting Xiao Li feel that the whole body is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s so-called strict secrets only lasted for less than a week, and he told himself that he had taken a future architect as a student. People in the circle. These people also failed to adhere to the full moon, and told the news to their heart. So repeated, less than two months, the entire dark blue knows that a future builder is born. Although there are endless uncertainties in the future, since this is the evaluation made by Su Hailun, then it must be correct. Even if there are still people who are suspicious, they will not be stupid enough to make a statement. The idiot who always tells the truth, there is no need for the legendary mage to start, naturally there are a lot of people willing to destroy, in exchange for ‘Su Helun’s joy’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, until now, only one person in the entire dark blue does not know who the future builder is. The person whose news is blocked is Richard. Of course, Richard is not without feeling abnormal. For example, I don’t know why, mathematics, geometry, composition, aesthetics in the course... All the courses related to Magic Array suddenly multiply, and some courses even in the basic tutorial section. Classmate, only one student left afterwards. However, for these anomalies, Richard's reaction was only slightly worried about the increase in expenditures meant by the course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, Richard’s curriculum has undergone new changes, and painting tutorials have begun to increase in number. The basis for getting started is sketching. Richard began another field of study. But the homework he handed in, but always let the famous painter who was once famous in Noland laugh and cry. Each of Richard's sketches is so precise that he can't find any flaws at all. But what about the charm? Painting is art, not simply reproducing reality. But if the reproduction is true to the point where it is no different from reality, can it be called an art? Therefore, the great painter, every time he saw Richard's work, always wanted to vomit blood. The painting, which is exactly one hundredth of a centimeter in size, is like a block of boulder, heavy on his chest, crushing his faith and understanding of art again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could it be so accurate! How can it be? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the beginning to the end, the great painter could not spit out a reprimand. Although Richard's paintings do not conform to the usual art of painting, no matter what goes to extremes, it can be counted as an art. And the painter who is a fifteenth grade teacher understands that Richard may not be open in art, but for the magician, especially the builder, this precision is a unique talent. Therefore, he can't say anything untimely. After all, he is crazy about art, and he can't ignore the weight of 'Su Hailun's joy.' Just as buildings need foundations, art also needs bread and gold coins to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a future sacred sect is destroyed because of his preference, then it is to be "Su Hailun's violent". As long as you think of the possible prospects, this great magician and great painter would rather go to the polar gray dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha occasionally worries about his bill. He has now added a lot of 'jobs', counting down to an average of one small painting, two to five magical arrays, and a lot of plane geometry. The hard work of the homework is not to mention him. The key is that the stationery for writing homework is worth a lot. The first is the writing tools, which need to consume a large amount of special magic paper, such as star paper, moon mark paper, abyss nightmare cloth, etc., as well as a variety of inks, from ordinary dark ink to Lolls hell. Anyway, the common feature of these materials is expensive, and the longer the name is, the more expensive it is. As for the geometry of the plane, because it is a three-dimensional composition, it needs to be completed on the magic image of the magic test bench. The amount of magic crystal consumed is not calculated by Richard. All in all, he often sees the waiter carry a box of new magic crystals and then remove the empty boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the joy of the legendary Master is still going on, Richard really doesn’t know what he should do, and now he can barely maintain the balance of payments. The use of time also encountered the same problem of not being able to make ends meet. In addition to class and homework, he also needs to meditate and practice magic skills, and the time spent on this part has been compressed to the limit, and if it is reduced, it will really affect itself. The magic has grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting the expected range of magic growth, Richard is based on the average level of the lower-level wizards observed daily, and does not take Minnie. Alternative as a comparison. Even if you only maintain the speed of basic magic, you must rely on magic to restore your medicine. The magical recovery of the unit price of 500 gold coins, one bottle per day, one month is 15,000 gold coins. It is also an expensive expense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is too small, the only option left to Richard is to compress sleep time. But when he is growing up, the food he supplies every day is specially formulated. It contains several kinds of rare bloodstains of World of Warcraft, which can consolidate blood to accelerate body growth. For this type of special ingredients to be fully effective, all they have in common is that they need adequate sleep. Fortunately, there are many ways to perform shallow meditation through sleep in the dark blue. Although the effect is limited, it is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that Richard is facing now is that he has to do too much, and his time is too small, how to allocate limited time and resources to achieve the most comprehensive effect. It is obviously a mathematical problem. And the difficulty of this problem will rise linearly as the variable increases. Richard used to spend four days, sorting out the things to be done, summarizing them into several major categories, setting out the necessary steps, bringing the wisdom talent to the limit, and calculating the best distribution plan for material, time and operation. I have solved the problem that has been plaguing myself. The four-day time was extremely worthwhile, because the program was formed, and the ‘precision’ talent immediately produced a new and old program benefit comparison result. If you do not optimize the overall effect, then within a month, Richard will waste more than the sum of the four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
