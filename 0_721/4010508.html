Without her participation, I would like to leave a Tibetan sword. I am afraid there is still difficulty. The terrible thing about the super strong is that it can be It’s easy to tear away space and want to beat them. It’s one thing to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sword smiled and said: "Leave me what to do, if I can't go back from Calando, the emperor will have to fight the holy tree dynasty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that with the threat of war, you can do whatever you want." Hua Wen said lowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibetan replied: "This is not, I just don't want to look at what you want. The mountains and the sea are nominally my students. How can I take care of them?" Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese a little thought, immediately said: "Well, since you are here, I can't make no concessions, you just have to do this. I don’t want to do it, I don’t know how to do it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibetan faintly said: “I’m a little bit more powerful than you, can’t do it with you. How about the killer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Hua Wen immediately agreed, although he ate a little loss, but as long as the sword does not come to chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tibetan sword pointed to the statue of the beast on the wall and said to the elders of Calando: "The beast is here, you should not be To make things that are too sorry for the doctrine of the beast, if the Archbishop of China has forsaken the agreement, I hope that you can remain neutral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the elders are not very good looking The Tibetan sword spoke up and said, "I am looking for a place to go to sleep." Then I left the House of Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tibetan sword went away, and the chamber of the chamber immediately became silent and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Hua Wen broke the silence and said: "Elders, this is a major event that affects the vital interests of both of us. We can't bother a Tibetan sword. According to the agreement, although I can't do anything with a subordinate, I have brought a lot of talents this time. For example, we still have this thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese took off the ring on the hand and unscrewed it. Gems, poured a little powder on paper, said: "This powder can dissolve the magic. As far as I know, Richard is a magician. The magic is fundamental to him. The elders only need to take this medicine to Li. Check the meals or drink water, you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder elders look ugly, the mother of the mountains and the sea Asa is a double eyebrow slowly erect, It is about to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of China saw a smile and said: "Don't forget, the overall situation, you have done a lot of things, um, a lot of bad things, if this is the case If you want to give up, then it’s a joke.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders are still hesitating, and the Chinese body is slightly tilted, saying: “With the broken Midalun In exchange for the complete Ulle, the son of God born in the future is also your Karando, and what have you paid, the purity of the mountains and the sea, the dignity, the autonomy, the jokes, according to the tradition of the temple, to be arranged sooner or later If a person has a child with her, this candidate is not determined by her, but the person you choose cannot be armed with the kingdom of heaven. This is the point, think about it, get a future super super strong, a set can The armies of heaven that have been passed down from generation to generation, how much have you paid in total, a set of useless pieces, a woman’s night, and hesitate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The elders hesitated, looking at the powder, frowning said: "But Needless to use this means, Richard is still the opponent of Ulle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like variables, this is the difference between you and me." With the eyes of the elders, he said, "Hold it, go down to the water that Richard is drinking, and then everything can go back to the original track. It's as simple as that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp There seems to be a magic in the voice of the Archbishop of China. The elders gritted their teeth and reached for the powder. Asa suddenly reached out and held down the hand of the elders. The elders turned to look at her. The word says: "This is, for Calando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Calando... Asa suddenly felt that his heart was too heavy to breathe, Goshawk said Once again, she echoed in her heart again, she still wanted to stop, but the elders had already withdrawn their hands and took away the powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen showed a satisfied smile and said: "The wise decision, but after seeing the power of the armed forces of heaven, you will still hesitate, really disappointing me, I hope we can meet people in the next thing. Pleasant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next thing." The elders glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it’s about the game, you have to arrange a person to play against Richard. This candidate is very important, because Richard...should die in your barbarian Hands," Hua Wen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why kill Richard?" Asaton stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen sneered: "Leave him, don't he wait for revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am not afraid of him coming to revenge." Asa angered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese spread his hands and smiled and said: "You are not afraid, but the reputation of the temple, the presbyterian reputation, Richard lived back, put The incident shook outwards. How many of you felt that you were able to sit in an elder position at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentences make Asa no Properly, the transaction with the Holy Tree Dynasty may be for the future of Calando, but the dirty inside can not be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha is just a small person, not worth mentioning, even if there is a Tibetan sword, it will not affect the overall situation, what is so good to kill such a small person, good Now, I went back to rest. This little thing, I believe that a few elders will definitely not say anything." Huawen said, he stood up and returned to his place to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assad’s staring elders, the elders no longer care about her, but put the powder into their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the sky is already bright, and when Asa returns to her home, she sees that the Goshawk is playing chess with the Tibetan sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are back." Goshawk smiled and waved at Asa and said, "I have heard the Tibetan sword, this time the Holy Tree Dynasty Actually it is a Chinese bishop. It is really tricky. We can give Richard a fair decisive battle environment. It is also worthy of him. He can be told with his daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah." Asa smiled and turned and walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibetan watched Asa’s back, thoughtfully, the Goshawk was frowning, and after a long time, he couldn’t go down, he simply put the pieces Put it aside and say, "I see the six princes who came here this year. The six princes are also good. It is enough to have my daughter, oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tibetan sword shook his head: "From the perspective of the empire, this thing can't make them so smooth, and you don't feel a bit strange, how is the power of Midrand, you and I are very clear, how is it worth? The sacred tree is under such a large capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also..." The goshawk snarled and said: "Or else wait for the end of the matter, It’s probably a better way to intercept them in Noland and see what kind of conspiracy they are doing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibetan asked: “So, that What did Richard do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goang sighed and said, "Although I like this little guy very much, we do it for him. It’s okay, you can’t let you desperately ignore his own safety. But it’s the sacred dynasty’s sudden sudden occurrence of such a thing. It’s very weird. First of all, I have to find a way to make this clear.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tibetan sword nodded, and then studied the map of Calando with the Goshawk to see where it is appropriate to intercept the sacred dynasty. At the time of the temple, the sword was temporarily relegated. It was because there were Asa and the elders present. When the people of the sacred dynasty returned, a Chinese language could not stop the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the two men’s planning, Tianbai finally had a morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to Richard’s door was knocked out, and then a handsome young man was brought in, and he was sent a breakfast and a schedule for today’s battle. In eight battles, Richard’s opponent was a warrior recommended by the holy temple. No matter who the opponent is, Richard knew nothing, and the barbarian warriors refused to disclose the slightest information after they knew his identity. He, but what kind of person is the opponent, Richard does not care much, anyway, no matter who it is, it is to be defeated. As for the opponent's bottom, Richard with insight is not required too much information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the schedule and looked at it while picking up the barbecue specially prepared for the temple. He ate it, and soon a large pot of barbecue was seen. At the end, Richard picked up the water bag and drank half a bag in one breath. He felt that he was full and well, and his condition was just right. At this time, there was a loud noise outside the house. When Richard saw that the time was almost up, he went outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
