The so-called strong above means that thousands of thirteen powerful units mean that Richard can form a knight who is also an elite force in Noland and a general knight of the three major empire. However, because of the structure and equipment of the addition of the thirteenth level of the nesting knight is also equivalent to the 12th level of the Norland common knight <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger can't make enough interest to make Richard feel sensation. Richard is indeed ready to feed him to the mother's nest. In fact, the brain has already flown over the road. The mother's nest can't even wait for land transportation, but directly send the brain to the receiver. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu finally confirmed Richard’s determination. He looked down for a while before he looked up and said, “Before I say the benefits, I can't answer a few questions first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" Richard said calmly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are From the ectopic face, it is still the servant of the new face of the plane. "Zonghu asked him to escape a lot of rumors about the invasion of the devil's terminator in the process of fleeing. But now, when faced, it is a lot more doubts, even if he looks The priests who have three goddesses in the ranks can't dispel his doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eccentric plane we belong to is called Noland" Richard is particularly present. They are all their own and the Zonghu will soon feed the mother's nest. A dead person, especially a dead person swallowed by the mother's nest, will have no secrets<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu face What appeared on it was relief and relaxation, but it made Richard feel a little strange. If someone hears such a secret, they will know that they are no longer fortunate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : "The deity of God of War is falling in your hands. I lost two artifacts on the battlefield. They are in your hands now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I took out the divinity in the artifact and used it, so the two artifacts have been destroyed"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zong Hu is more relaxed and reveals a fascinating smile. "It’s the only thing you can say about the Temple of War."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really" Richard nodded I agree that <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s another ecstasy that has robbed the god of war and you seem to be ready to be enemies with the Faro gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head and said: "This doesn't have to look at whether the gods will stand on my side, such as the goddess of the three goddesses. If you become my person, I will naturally not be enemies with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship between you and the god of courage?" Zonghu eyes staring at Richard Asked <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the duty of Nei'an is courage, there is no possibility of surrender, then of course I have to uproot his roots in the world." This is the future of Richard. The plan is actually the most intense in the gods of Faro and the enemy of Richard is the god of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the invaders of Richard are inside If the power is back, it is difficult to say whether it can keep the secret. Other gods are not so dangerous. God is not a versatile retrospective. A thing that has nothing to do with them and has no accurate time and place is not as easy as the average believer thinks.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu’s eyes are shining: “This is enough. I think we have a basis for full cooperation. My identity is actually...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A son of a god is already mysterious?" Nai-Yi said coldly next to him<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu’s expression I don't know how to pick it up again<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of God is not enough mysterious? To what extent can I be mysterious and Nai’s real can see his truth? The identity also shocked Zong Hu. He always thought that Naiyou had exaggerated a 12-level priest in the eyes of Zonghu, who was originally a lazy fish that was too lazy to kill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The birth of the gods is full of the appearance of the dark and frantic gods and the blood Darkness to unimaginable levels and retains the most obvious cases of tiger now belong to the human soul is already an uncommon anomaly some of his odd behavior is actually quite normal <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Richard said: "Go on"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we are natural allies in dealing with the gods of Faro and all I want is to put God of Lutheran and The god of courage, Nei, pushed down from the throne to the three goddesses. I am not interested in how they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and shook his head and said: "Allies are not convincing"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu silent and then slowly said: "I think you are such a thing that makes me not dignified"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said faintly: "You are the son of God, how can I believe in your credibility and loyalty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu is silent again this time is a whole ten Ten minutes after the minute, he asked again: "How can I be sure that you will be on the road against God after paying a heavy price"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Licha smiled and said: "In my lifetime...this time seems to be a little long, you may not be able to see the results"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu Socket: "I If the Son of God does not have the true God to purify me at the expense of divinity, even if it is immortal, even if it is fragmented, it will eventually become a new god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I nodded and said, "That's why I have a lot of confidence in my life. I dragged Nei from the throne to Ludreus. After all, he is powerful or will have trouble. I can weaken him if there is no accident. The degree of faint divine power is that you want to deprive the godhead and you need to look at luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu is a shocked voice: "This...this is impossible for you." May know how to weaken a true God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled very easily: "It's hard. How do we become gods and how to fight God and how It’s not a secret to take the true God out of the throne. There is a complete process and even a textbook. Next time I bring a set to show you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu This time, I was finally hit by the arrogance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard finally said all really believe in fact, he had no choice <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;After a moment, Zonghu solemnly said: "If you can swear by your gods that you will do what you just said or at least try to do it, then I am willing to do anything for you as long as it can fight God of War and courage. But other things I need to decide on my own. In addition, I need basic freedom and rights. This is my last bottom line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowns in communication The mother nest asked: "How is this condition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother nest silently calculated for a while and said: "If you can't eat him... then I need to suck some His blood sucks a little bit a month for a month, maybe it's enough for me to open the door to the ninth-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s not enough," Richard asked if it’s still not enough. Richard still throws the Zonghu to the mother's nest<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest's answer finally reassures Richard: "It would be enough to take another few months." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of blood, Richard believes that this pair of Zonghu is by no means a problem How strong is the ability to recover from immortality? It is conceivable that it is just sucking blood. It’s just a matter of years. What’s the big deal?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Zonghu: "If you want to attach such a condition, then you need to work harder with me. I need some of your blood to carry out several rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem" Zong Hu easily replied that the rituals to be carried out with blood, especially the blood of the gods, are the dark and evil Zonghu. No matter what Richard wants to summon, no matter what it is, it is against the gods who are not allowed by the gods. Natural support <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard frowned again: "But how do I know that you will not suddenly turn around and deal with me if you have freedom"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Zonghu is so evil, powerful, and difficult to judge and there is no way to control it, it is better to feed the nest directly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Next to the flowing sand said: "The Dragon Temple has a soul slave scroll. You are the one you use on the water. You go to Nolan and say she will sell it. One million gold coins, one sees you want to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is quite a heart-warming million gold coin is really one for the original Archimonde The huge amount of money that can't be afforded is not enough for the giants or today's Richard. It just needs to weigh the pros and cons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
