The process of absorbing the power of the plane is more difficult than the most difficult situation he expected. Fortunately, the fourth-order magic star world tree finally succeeded in absorbing the source, but also paid a huge price in the magic star world. Before the tree was restored, Richard's meditation effect would be greatly reduced, so that Richard would not dare to use sacrifices easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don’t know what it will be like when the Magic Star Tree recovers. Will it become the fifth order? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha swallowed the last piece of meat, and then took a long breath, he finally finished eating all the meat of the monster, and the fire in the belly It’s just as uncomfortable, the stomach doesn’t seem to be so eccentric, and I’m going to dump the things I ate, but Richard forced the discomfort in the abdomen, rested quietly, waiting for the recovery of physical strength, not long after. A stream of heat is generated in the abdomen, and the body is added to the past. Richard's eyes are slightly stunned, while resting, he repeatedly thinks about what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, Richard needs to find a safe place to fill the magic of the book in the book, and the four-page book of the book does not increase the storage. Magic, but the upper limit of the magic that can be saved from seven to eight, which is just right for the current Richard, a book that bears, it is equivalent to five more eight levels of magic, playing a huge role in the battle, just After a battle with the fish-type tentacle monster, Richard was hesitant about what kind of magic to add to the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of the Dakso Das people whom Richard had seen before, from the bear chief to the black wizard, the devil, although the magic resistance is high, but there is no It is as high as the monster, and the defense, concealment and speed of this monster are not weak. The only shortcoming is that the attack power is insufficient and the attack method is somewhat single. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the Dakosodas have natural resistance to the power of darkness, chaos, and fire, so Richard is best at the fire system. The magic effect has been greatly weakened. In addition, on the battlefield of this strongman, the magic of scope killing is almost useless, even if it is the magic of the eight-level range, the lethality is very limited for the individual strong, so Richard It is better to store the lightning that has been improved by the super magic effect in the book of the bearer, and can not find the appropriate eight-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of nine-level magic should be studied, it is also a question that Richard needs to think now. He originally chose the banshee's shackles. With his powerful soul power and spell-penetrating structure, the power of the banshee is Greatly improved, the slightly weaker creatures have almost no resistance. Richard originally intended to clean up a large number of ordinary enemies, and then concentrate on dealing with the powerful enemies that survived the banshee, but in the dusk, the banshee The role of the shackles has also been greatly limited, and the real powerhouse is obviously not likely to be killed by the banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the choice of magic while he was using his hand as a knife, squatting forward and backward, practicing repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was immersed in the world of power, the earth suddenly trembled again, and Richard’s calculation of time should be the second place in the rising sun. The second battle began. The level of this battle is far from what he can participate in, so Richard closed his eyes and continued to immerse himself in his own world. Only the improvement of his own strength is the power that truly belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the earth continued to vibrate, this time without stopping, after a moment, Richard opened his eyes in amazement, the tremor of the earth made him Also swayed, this is what kind of strong, actually can always extract the power of the plane's source to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, took risks, and cast a battlefield compass. He suddenly saw that the pointer to the rising sun was actually converted into Gold, although the color of the pointer is now beating, but the golden background is firmly nailed there, and it does not change gradually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear about what this means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or a few superpowers entered the dusk, and they not only captured the shame of the Holy Alliance, but also the sacred place of the Rising Sun. Lived in the crazy counterattack of the Dakso Das. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Richard could not help but boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the battlefield. This is the war. It is the person who calms and is sensible. In times of war, there will be time when he becomes impassioned, forgetting to die, life and death, sometimes Not so important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately forced himself to calm down, and the excitement of fighting was the key to the army’s combat, but in the dusk of the strong, the calm is more important. The quality, but the two eyebrows of the invisible wrinkles, and then took the book of the book in a very natural movement, as if reading the ordinary book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is still trembled occasionally, the pain of the plane is calming down, and the war in the distance has come to an end, but it is very quiet around Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too quiet around, even the constant winds have stopped, no wind, it means no smell, the land of dusk will always have The wind, the corner of the eye of Richard's eyes swept across the rugged land, but did not find anything strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang stretched out and took the fate of his son in his hand. He suddenly waved in one direction, a thick yellow-green fog in the dozens The production outside the rice, rapidly expanding to a radius of 30 meters, acid mist, is not a powerful spell, the lethality is very limited, that is, ordinary human warriors are trapped in the acid mist, it will take some time to die, but Li Inspecting and casting this spell, but not to kill the enemy, when the acid mist is out, Richard rushed out like an arrow, and even slammed into his sour mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden move immediately shocked the enemy, only to see nearly ten mouse leaps from the hiding place, full speed, some of which directly rushed To the acid mist, the other half of the mouse is intercepted to the front of the acid mist, only waiting for Richard to rush out of the fog and kill it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall and detailed figure fluttering in the distance, it is a black mage, it is holding a skinny arm to distinguish the meaning The voice chanted the spell and didn't know what magic to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, Richard has rushed out of the acid mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t go through the mist, but from the place where he rushed into the fog, which made all the mouse devils wrong, they made a mistake. Directions, one by one, to stop the castration, sharp claws draw a deep groove on the ground, sparking sparks, but they originally ran too fast, huge inertia pushed them to continue to slide forward, temporary distance Richard is getting farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master is stunned, even the half of the spell that has been prepared has stopped, because Richard is facing it, a few hundred meters away It can be very far away, or it can be very close. It quickly changes the spell. In the blink of an eye, the magic of a powerful attack is rushed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the body is shining, the speed has been raised to the fastest, the magic that the black wizard has come to, without the tracking effect, the prejudgment and speed dodge, there are The tracking effect is offset by instant masks or phantom splits. It can't be cracked. Richard will rush to the top, and when he is at full speed, he is also flipping the book of carrying, a light The red lightning fell on the black mage's head, causing it to smoke all over the body, blaming it, interrupting the magic that was already prepared to half, although the magical resistance of the black magician itself was extremely high, but the power of the eight magic. It was so easy to resist, and with a heavy blow, the Black Master no longer dared to arbitrarily blame, blaming himself for adding countless magic protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second blood-colored lightning fell again, and the black magician's defensive magic was smashed for most of the time. The black wizard panicked and added defensive magic to himself again. At this time, Richard had already rushed to the front, and the elf had a long knife. Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf knife slashed a beautiful knife in the air, silently passing the black master's slender body, and then went on the go, straight When Richard slipped a few meters away in the air, it slowly fell and shed light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense life of the moment, in the deadly battlefield, is as striking as the candlelight in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li was on the ground, he was not standing still, and the black mage behind him was five meters long and suddenly disconnected from the waist. Spraying ink-like blood syrup, and ping-pong continually explodes, Black Master’s lower body is still standing, blind and aimless, the first half of the body falls on the ground, constantly twitching, mouth There was a screaming scream in the body, and the arm supported the body to crawl forward, but its wounds were still blasting, and the effect of flesh and blood bursting still existed, so its upper body became shorter and shorter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an injury, even if the Dakso Das people who are known for their vitality are no longer viable, Richard is even more ignorant of the four overlapping lives. The killing power is very confident. I don’t look back at the results. I chose a direction and rushed to the full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this direction, there are two mouse devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has blessed his freedom of movement and acceleration, and the speed is so fast that he has pulled out the afterimage and passed away with the two rats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf knife swayed a large knife light again, and the two mouse screams two long screams, and a huge wound suddenly appeared on the side of the body, almost cut. Halfway through, their bodies are filled with a lot of dwarven gunpowder, and flesh and viscera fragments are squirting out of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already rushed out of the encirclement of the mouse demon and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining six-headed mouse was shocked and angry, screaming, chasing after Richard, and with Richard, the company’s companion The bodies were laid down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
