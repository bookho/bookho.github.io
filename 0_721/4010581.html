			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden sudden change, and many people stopped at the moment. At this time, the ground began to vibrate, and the fierce murderous air was dispersed. It was ready to go. The knights of the structure set up the formation and began to sprint towards this side. Their rifles all condensed in all kinds of vindictiveness, and there was no reservation at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper has integrated the knight and the magical knight, just like the moving fortress, rushing to the four strong night elves, the face of the first knights There was no expression on it, and all the eyes were cold and murderous. The four strong night elves were shocked and immediately retreated. They couldn’t stop the frontal collision of many knights, but they took a few steps to find out. Can not retreat, because behind them are the many people of the Yongye tribe. If they give in, the powerful knights do not even need to shoot a gun. Direct trampling can make the Yongye elves die and hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these four strong people are savagely stalking in place, ready to resist the impact of the knight, although this is no different from the death, the first few The knights of the structure, like thunder and lightning, rushed past the four elf strongmen, and the rifle in the hand was heavily stabbed. The four eternal night elves each took the full blow of these knights, but they also Hit by lightning, the whole body was shocked, his face was bleak, but the knight who rushed past was only the first wave, and the latter batch of eight riders had already rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key moment is the voice of Alizee on the battlefield: "Don't kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-player knight heard the command, and the power of the rifle suddenly converges a lot. However, under the blow of the rotation, the four eternal night elves are still injured by the severity. The brigade of the brigade immediately rushes and puts all the The night elves were all around, and Ellie jumped down the magic ride and rushed to Richard, anxiously asking, "What's wrong with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reluctantly propped up the body and said weakly: "In the middle of the calculation, there is nothing big, fast... We must start immediately, can't wait any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie婕 Carefully removed the hand of Richard holding the wound, and then whispered and trembled. I saw that the wound had become a vaguely empty hole, and there was still thick blood in it, just blood. That piece of minced meat made Alice look scared, I don’t know how to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, several strong men of the Eternal Night Elf finally knew that Mellin suddenly attacked Richard, which triggered a series of conflicts, two big Drews. Look at each other and say, "Let's try it, maybe it can be a little useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there are no priests in the Richards, and in the Greenson plane, the effect of Druid healing is not worse than that of the gods. However, the treatments of the great Druids fall on Richard, but the effect is poor, just let the wound The blood flow slows down, and finally no longer bleeds. When the natural force in the treatment falls in the wound, a dark gray mist will float from the flesh and blood, neutralizing the natural forces, and Ellie sees it. Anxious, the two Druids know that the layer of fog is the special strength of Melin, the son of the forest is good at natural forces, but also good at fighting against natural forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two great Druids were exhausted, a lot of treatments made Richard’s spirit better, and then Richard struggled to climb the sacred independence. The horned beast pointed out the direction of the base city, and the earth immediately violently vibrated. The huge eternal night of life moved the roots and took the first step of the migration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night hunters are scattered around, they will be responsible for the perimeter alert, the center is the knight, then the night tree, the night elves After following the tree of life, the young and weak will take turns to rest on the tree of life. Richard and Alice are also in the tree house at the top of the tree of life. At this time, Richard is lying on the bed, and Ellie is holding a Only a large bowl, slowly poured a green juice into the mouth of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Li drunk is the juice squeezed from the heart of the tree of life. The natural atmosphere inside is very pure and rich, and immediately after drinking it, it is like a spring rain. Repairing the damaged organs everywhere, the size of the bowl in the hand of Ellie’s hand consumes one-third of the heart of the tree of life, and Richard drinks the sap, closes his eyes, and silently drives with meditation. The sap energy went to the most severely damaged place. A little natural energy was not restrained, and it was scattered into the blood vessels. It was directly absorbed by several blood-blooded trees. Richard’s heart moved, but the tree of heart of the tree of life was unexpected. It can directly strengthen the blood power of nature. In this way, the value is even higher than the simple sacrifice. If it is matched with the natural fruit, the effect will be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the body of Richard, there are still a lot of fog and stubborn existence, and Richard’s own strength repeatedly fights for killing. Although they are weak, they are destructive. It is extremely strong, and it has the ability to constantly destroy the body of the body to recover itself. It is extremely sinister and vicious. The two talents of Richard’s wisdom are all on the same, mobilizing their own energy, and dealing with this kind of fog with the method of killing the battlefield. It is to suppress first, then slowly dissolve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the action of the tree of life, the tree house is shaking in a regular way, when Richard digests the tree heart fluid and absorbs it almost, open eyes, Ellie I asked, "How is your injury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said: "It’s very troublesome. It’s estimated that if you don’t have a month or two, I have to go back to Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie In the blink of an eye, a murderous murder was revealed, saying: "This Mei Lin, I really can't see such a means. The other elves of the Yongye tribe may have problems. I have already made people alert. Once someone has changed, kill immediately." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns for a moment, shaking his head and saying: "Not quite right, I always think that person is not Melin, Melin absolutely can't make this kill." Zhao, if she has the power of the great elders, the vindictiveness attached to her dagger is indeed her own, but the change has already had the power of rules, and the understanding and application of the rules is still in my On the other hand, to achieve this level, the legend of the newly promoted class can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what she is, in short, I want to kill you, I will see her again in the future, and I must not be soft." Ellie said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice suddenly sighed, Say: "You understand that you have a ghost. Now the whole Archimonde hope is on you. Once you have something wrong, no one else can support the situation. At that time, it must be a continuous war, so you will have more in the future. Think about your own responsibilities, there are many places where you need to take care of and be responsible. The Yongyue tribe is just one of them. Even if you look at that Mei Lin, in the current situation, you should first hit her. Responsible to say, at that time, you still don't want to play anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic makes Richard only smile, he doesn't want Mei Lin, the relationship with him does not want to let too many people know, so it is vague in the past, but the words of Alice are also letting Richard think deeply. His current responsibilities are indeed more and more, and the relationship to be dealt with involves all aspects. Even Richard knows that the forces under his command are no longer iron plates, and they are also open to each other. With contradictions, the family has developed too fast. Now, on the scale and strength, there are already six shelves of floating island giants, but there are still some shortcomings in the top legendary powerhouses. However, Richard has a large number of structures. Wearing the knight, but not afraid of the ordinary legend, and with the creation of everything into a gray, the wisdom is also advanced to the sixth order, its own combat power is not inferior to the legend, and to this stage, many people With their own ideas and demands, that is, having interests and different interests, there is naturally a faction. It is no longer a simple time for a small team to live and die when they first arrive at Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
