			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ten pieces of black clouds cover the sides of the city center, and the lightning is very dense. There are several lightning drops every second. These lightnings have a blue-blue light, which is marked by the power of the stars and the natural rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt can’t stop the Knights and the Silver Sword Guards, even if they hit them directly, the power will only make them slightly hurt, and they will have more than a dozen lightning bolts. It is possible to kill a knight, and the effect on the sanctuary is even more minimal, but the thunder and lightning are deadly to ordinary warriors. Richard’s dozens of thunderclouds are equal to each other on both sides of the city. A dead zone, all warriors who want to cross this area are facing a high probability of death threats. Two infantry battalions that should have come to support are killed by two lightning strikes and killed dozens of times. The warrior, suddenly into chaos, wants to re-team, at least ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the battlefield, ten minutes is already too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reloading infantry saw their speed of being slaughtered, and in less than ten minutes they would be killed by the Knights of the Suifeng, and the reinforcements specified in the battle. I didn’t know where I was going, the morale immediately fell to the bottom of the valley, and I fled directly, and the knights and the brigade knights swarmed in. The iron hoof shook the whole city and trembled. In the middle of the ranks, the tall ogre lords looked unusually fierce. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to Nyris: "I saw it, this is the end of Finlay's preservation of the knight, well, we are up." There was some slight gasp in the voice. Richard was the first to control the large-scale siege magic array. Although there are wisdom talents and the aid of magical reincarnation, and these thunderclouds can absorb the natural forces around them to grow, but they are also consumed seriously. Under normal circumstances, the Siege Magic Array is laid by at least one mage group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron of the squadron flooded into Jianfeng City, and along the Central Avenue all the way to the castle, the sword of the sword was finally dispatched, the Silver Sword Guard Also dispatched, but they ran into the squadron knight, a shock fell on dozens of rides, the squadron knight died and even more, but the follow-up knight did not hesitate, as if did not see the former knight killed, Straight into the other side of the camp, do not defend themselves, only to fight for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the classic way of fighting for the knights, they are not afraid of death, but the silver sword guards and the knights are human beings, people will hesitate and Fear, at least some hesitation before going to death, and Count Fenlier did not give them reasons to be generous to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the gap opened by the Knights of the Frontier, Richard's knights flocked out, followed by the brigade of the Brigade Knights, and the Silver Swordsman and the Guards lost more than half of the time and continued to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard’s tactics are fully revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first used a day and night intermittent attack harassment to make a large number of ordinary warriors in Jianfeng City tired, but such an harassment is not for elite knights above ten The burden is too heavy. At the moment of the midnight attack, the ordinary warrior of the silver sword is very weak, the morale is also reduced to the bottom, and the thundercloud that is secretly covered by Richard is in the outer periphery, so that on the battlefield leading to the castle, both sides It has become an elite and elite, and with respect to the elite individual strength, Richard far exceeds the silver sword family. Even after a day of cross-attacks, he still has an overwhelming advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Nyris have risen to the sky, this is a sign of challenge to the other sanctuary strong, if the strong side of the silver sword does not dare to fight, Undoubtedly another huge blow to morale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, the three sacred strongmen wrapped in the light also rose to the sky, flew to Richard and Neris, on the ground, Tirami Su Zheng is dying and pushing forward. With the help of the superior forces of the party, even the ogre lord who cannot use the power of the Sanctuary is still a one-sided slaughter on the ordinary knight, and the warhammer will fly one by one. It is the object that should be blocked most, but as long as there is a bit of a sanctuary, after seeing the Chaos Dragon that has never completely dissipated above the ogre, it will not choose Tiramisu as an opponent, but they do not know, Choosing the results of Richard and Nyris will not be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver swords three Sanctuary strongmen have two to fly to Richard, one to find Niris, the two Sanctuary strong are obviously playing The idea of ​​destroying the weakest Richard first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakest Richard, Richard Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just ascended into the sky, and suddenly the bloody light of the night sky flashed, and a shadow hit the sky like lightning, and instantly caught up with Li One of the people inspected suddenly burst into a huge blood flower in the air. The broken limbs fell like rain, and the sanctuary of the silver sword family disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight floating in the place throws a hot heart into his mouth, eats it in the middle of the car, and then suddenly a layer of blush on his face The momentum is growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sacred strongman who flew before the glimpse of the horror was behind him. This scary is not a trivial. He didn’t even know how his companion died. As a result, the trajectory of the flight was one-sided, subconsciously It’s a little farther away from the gorgeous twilight, and a little further, but the one he was facing, this distraction is deadly. This sanctuary suddenly feels that there is something wrong with the atmosphere, no sound, no The wind, the whole world seems to have stopped at this moment. He suddenly realized some vague uneasiness. He only had time to push the vindictiveness to form a semi-circular defensive shield. He suddenly turned his head and saw a bright red knife near the field of vision. If the moon is shining gracefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment, this sanctuary thinks only that Richard is not still a hundred meters away, how come to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no answer to this question. The moonlight is passing straight in front of him, leaving only a shallow blood mark, but the knife has erased the sanctuary. The whole life of the person, as for the defensive shield seems to be opened by the breeze on the lake, only a few squats in the air, he stiffened in the air, fell straight, fell heavily on the ground, almost no one saw Li How to see how it broke into, only the bright red knife light brought by the last blow, only to make people feel amazing in an instant, just like the most complete moment of the first string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the sky, Nyris is playing brilliantly with the Sanctuary strongman, the four-handed four-handed king is domineering, the start is the wind Rainstorm-like attack, light belt, starlight, electro-optic, fire and rain splashed around, hit the sacred strongman holding the squirrel, and will be bombarded dozens of meters away like a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is really pretentious and dazzling, the sound is ten times bigger than the twilight and Richard, but his opponent is injured and not dead, although he is very embarrassed. But still can still escape, and Richard and the twilight opponents have already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is in a hurry, his heart is worried, the offensive is getting more and more fierce, but the more anxious, the more he kills the sanctuary, and the name The strong obviously defensively, not willing to attack at a time, but also repeatedly tried to break through, intending to come out, and surely the most shameless sanctuary is the most powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze is flashing, I really want to help in the past, of course, her real purpose is to grab the heart of the strong, with the cover of the night She has quietly passed by the body of the strong man who was degraded by Richard. The body of the body that fell on the ground has a big hole in the chest, and the heart has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiramisu, which was smashing on the ground, also looked up. The three eyes were fixed on the sacred strongman who fled to the west. The ogre lord had no knights in front of him, and the silver sword guards actually Too weak, it is not enough to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the situation on the side of Nyris, so that neither twilight nor tiramisu should intervene, Nyres’s strength is better than that The Sanctuary is stronger than the other. The only thing missing is the experience of the battle. The four-placed battle course today will kill a sanctuary that wants to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gestured to the twilight and tiramisu, pointing his finger firmly at the Silver Sword Castle in Jianfeng City, and laying the castle means Jianfeng City fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre lord then bowed his head and held the warhammer and continued to move forward. Its huge body ran over an opponent like a hill, extremely heavy. The steel shovel is not a normal weapon that can be broken. Only the rifle that builds the knight can pierce, but the knight of the silver sword has been killed and injured, and the remaining ten riders have fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is here, the fall of Jianfeng City is a foregone conclusion, although there are still five thousand defenders in the city, but there is no knight and sanctuary strong, these ordinary There are more soldiers, and the resistance is fierce, but it is only a matter of delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the battle between Nyris and the Sanctuary is not successful, but the attack on enemy morale is far more than Lee. The check and the twilight that were not seen by most people, all the silver sword guards saw that the once sacred sacred strongman was beaten at the moment, no effort to fight, even the sanctuary This is the case, then what are the uses of these ordinary warriors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, the Silver Sword Castle fell, and another hour later, the Swordwind City garrison gave up resistance and surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fly in the ointment is that Count Fenlier, with ten builders and dozens of silver sword guards, escaped from Jianfeng City in the other direction, but Richard still caught seven or eight sized lords who had no time to escape. It was also a harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the Emperor of the Emperor seemed to want to make up for the shame of being chased by Richard all the time. He did not escape, but led the defenders of the castle. At the last moment, until the Niris, a sneak rushed, stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
