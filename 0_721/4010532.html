Richard said, and went to the depths of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin has always been with Richard. The strange thing is that whether it’s a follower or a knight, it’s a matter of course. No one came up to stop asking what to ask. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not very simple." Li saw, faintly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not that you are surrendering." Martin laughed and laughed, then continued to ask: "Do you just want the holy things in the temple." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holy things and the priests, I will take them away," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin: "You want a ransom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all... um, This book is good, put it away." Then, Richard picked up a holy scripture on the altar and threw it to a knight who was next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin shrugged and said, "This holy book is very general... but you like it, if not for ransom, then you do it." Intention... Well, let me think about it, you want to show strength and determination.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is somewhat surprised and said: “You are smart enough. Head, but this time let you guess, your Chinese archbishop almost killed me in Calando, and he still wants to make a war with me in Noland, then I am coming."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chinese, he is a dog in the church, a bad dog, but the church wants to develop, such a person is essential, in fact, you don't have to care too much, he is such a person It is destined to be sacrificed one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s remarks once again surprised Richard, who glanced at this inscrutable young cardinal. Q: "How about the strength and determination I showed this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impressed." Martin admired Listen to the tone completely from the heart, "as I understand it, you do it, not to wage war, but to avoid war, is not it." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Richard played with a helmet and said, "I like some of you now, and I am not tired when I talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not difficult to guess Now, the church's top management, including Chinese, should know that if you fight with you, the consequences will be serious, so before I continue to provoke you, I believe they will think carefully." Martin finished, and then appease: "Of course, in this case Choosing to go to war is a deliberate result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is deliberate, they will find that if they want to deal with me, the price will be more than expected. Much more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin does not care to say: "That is their business, ha, listen to your tone, have treated me as my own." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard discovered that he had unconsciously put Martin in the 'we' range, while the other top members of the Church were those. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your special ability?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a gift, an innate gift, just like people's blood abilities, and has nothing to do with faith, this ability, I call it Charismatic." Martin looked serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also awe-inspiring, and those who possess such abilities are called geniuses, charismatic, and indeed the same name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin immediately resumed his smile and shrugged: "This ability is just to let people naturally feel close to me, I really want to hang them, or No, it doesn't really matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin is just saying it is easy, but Richard knows in some areas, such as faith and politics, charismatic The effect will be magnified hundreds of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a builder knight ran over and said, "Adults, all the priests have been in charge, and now they are going to take them on the bus, but Several of them were very seriously injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was squatting, Martin next to him said: "I have a suggestion, since you want What is needed is the ransom and the church is no longer looking for you. Then there is no need to catch those priests. They have overdrafted their bodies and lives in the battle just now. They cannot withstand long distances, and these people are in the eyes of my master. It is a consumable that can be sacrificed and abandoned, but any one of them will be a big trouble. If you want to catch it, I am actually the best choice. Just take me one is enough, you can go to the holy Hui Church can offer any price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at Martin and said, "It sounds great, but you are worth so much money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so young, like a cardinal, currently There are only two in the Church of St. Hui, Me and Messiah. My title in the church is St. Martin, you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said: "St. Martin, the scheduled next Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinum shook his head: "It’s just one of the Pope’s choices...I’m with Messiah Between, there will be a person who will become the next pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This identity is enough, now let's see what else in this temple The holy things can be taken," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to the holy things, there can be nothing in this temple comparable to this holy book in my hands. Of course, you can take some What you want, but there are a few things that you should not take away, which will irritate the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at Martin and said "You seem to be helping me all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am helping myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said: "You and the Holy Scriptures in your hands, plus a few less important holy things, is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the knights have searched the entire temple, and moved some of the more sacred objects to the face of Richard. Some are actually Marked out and moved with the same look as Richard, Richard picked for a while, selected three swords, a broken shield and a golden holy cup, the two most famous artifacts of the St. Louis Temple, the glory the Lord A long sword used before the burning of the fire, and the robe used by Saint Louis, Richard did not move, he only took some ordinary holy things, and some even had no faith value at all. For example, the Holy Grail, which has been placed on the altar for centuries, is used to hold holy water, and there is no special place, even magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Martin saw Richard’s choice, but it was thoughtful, and the eyebrows inadvertently exposed the dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden fall of the Temple of St. Louis caused the entire sacred dynasty to be shaken. Richard used the soldiers to be different. In an instant, he went deep into the hinterland of the sacred dynasty and captured the city of Tobour, which made all the nobles of the dynasty all over the Northeast face. In the absence of light, the emperor immediately ordered the nearby aristocrats to mobilize in full, and in no case allowed Richard to escape the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the Church of St. Hui has set off an uproar. St. Martin was hijacked. This is a big event. Although Martin is only one of the Pope candidates, he is almost It is the appointed Pope. The dark Messiah will take over the Dark Templar and the referee in the future. When the Pope heard that Richard had no major defamation in the Temple of St. Louis, he was still polite after treating the officials. Tones, then immediately sent a special envoy to go to find Richard and prepare to negotiate with him to release the problem of St. Martin. As for the holy things, as long as the robe and the sword are still there, it is dispensable for Richard to take away those. Something, even he also took away a golden chalice that was useless. Did Richard look at the gold that made the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the purpose of Richard’s raid has been reached. In the return journey, Richard led more than 500 people and brought only a captive of St. Martin. More maneuverable and flexible, he made three in and three outs in Soram, and defeated several scattered corps of Soram, but the main force of the Duke could not capture the whereabouts of Richard, a total of seven battles. The Duke of Ram lost all of them. There were several battles in which the strength of the battle was inferior to Richard. How should he win? But Richard is the winner, and it is not a small victory. When the Duke saw the report, he could not Believing in his own eyes, he called the leading general to ask, and the general would only repeatedly say: "They are not people, they are machines, they are only machines of war."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under repeated inquiries, the Duke realized that the cooperation between the Knights of Richard’s Majesty had become tacitly inconceivable, and they completely became a whole, just like a thousand arms. Kill monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the Duke of Soram has made it clear that on the battlefield, it is certainly not a small super-excellent of Richard. The only solution is to be strong. Level of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was night, the Duke of Soram left the army alone and went to chase Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the moon passed, the Duke had found the place where the Richards were located, and Soram exposed the murderous machine, pulled out the two swords, and slowly fell to Li. When the legendary strongmen were dispatched, the war was about to come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
