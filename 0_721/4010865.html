			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vision was restored, Richard found that the entire mountain was shaking, broken The stone continued to fall, and even a boulder of one person's size fell off the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights and followers who work in the hall look at the dome, revealing the color of alarm, and many people have quietly gathered their anger. Here is the mountain belly. If the mountain body really collapses, it is because of their strength, there will be life and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris in the hall suddenly gave a sigh, and the vibration of the mountain was miraculously calmed down. Richard knew that it was a spirit. The magic of the gods has a powerful deterrent effect on the existence of ghosts and souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibration of the mountain is the unsuccessful incitement and resistance of the giant soul. The giant’s ** was killed by Richard. It seems that the soul fled back here if Give it thousands of years, and no longer be born again under the nourishment of the power of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard reinvented his heart into the core of the components, the soul of the giant could not suppress his anger, growl, want Buried all the enemies in the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris gave another sigh, and the vibration of the mountain was reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard shook his head in secret, and the Dark Artifact’s accomplishment in the soul is still not strong enough. If it’s here, she should be able to directly put the giant The soul of the soul has been taken from the hidden place, and has since become the object of slavery, and the swearing of Achilles can only play a deterrent effect and cannot cause substantial harm to the giant soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the edge of the platform and extended his left hand to the front of the void, slowly saying: "Why, not willing to be the fate of the coming, since you choose It is your destiny to be an enemy. Now you have two choices, leave, or destroy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left from the open left hand There are countless blue sparks flying in the air. They are like their own lives, flying in the air cheerfully, sketching out the beautiful blue trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All followers, including Achilles, only feel that these sparks are very beautiful, but ethereal, like the fireflies under the summer night, the beauty Beauty, but there is no breath of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the giant's roaring moment turned into exclamation, and a virtual shadow appeared in the void, with a few blue sparks on it, burning and sizzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant’s exclamation turned into a painful embarrassment, and it panicked to escape, and the phantom pulled out more of the afterimage. But more blue fire suddenly appeared in its soul in the flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the giants’ hundred-meter-high virtual shadow, the hundreds of blue moonfires released by Richard are negligible, but they are just a little bit The moonfire burned so much that the giants were in pain, and the huge virtual shadows quickly shrank. After a while, they turned into a transparent blue gem, which fell on the palm of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the hall, and all followers are watching the blue gem in Richard's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axiris suddenly had a chill, and felt very cold, then he found out that he did not know when a cold sweat, actually wet the whole body clothes Thorough, and he has a feeling of powerlessness, as if he just woke up from the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris suddenly realized that this is fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, Achilles once thought that he had forgotten what is fear, even death, staying in the country of the dead, will not make him feel fear, Even in the face of Gordon and Modred, Achilles has the courage to have a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the Dark Archer suddenly finds that he still has fear, and is so strong, he does not know, when he faces Richard one day, is he himself? There is also the courage of a desperate war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split blue sparks, with the power to imprison and destroy souls, their existence has invaded the realm of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Achilles suddenly felt that he did not know Richard. Is this the young boy who was in the beginning? A boy who is stubborn, but shy and can't even speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the strongest who started to get involved in the soul field like Asiris or Naiyou will really know the horror of the blue spark, that is able to The soul is refining the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Achilles tremble is that even the flame of the Star of Destruction will only destroy the soul, instead of capturing the soul as it is now, and smelting all the power of the soul into crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to do this seems to have only one possibility in the memory of Achilles, and the old and taboo word, even if it is looming, It will make Achilles shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the crystallization of the formation of the giant soul, from which he has experienced a little rule of taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the rule of power, at the expense of the body, and the rules of the giant force that is far beyond the real thing. If you follow this path, Li It is possible to see the path of the ancient Titans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a taboo soul hunter, Richard originally thought that he could only capture the soul fragments in a short moment after the strong man died, but did not expect that just a heartbeat, The blue fire that is emitted will burn the soul of the giant and crystallize it into a piece containing regular fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers mostly showed an uncontrollable alert color. They perceive the terrible power contained in those blue sparks, and thus instinctively alert and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are somewhat confused. They only know that the blue fire is very dangerous, but it is not clear where the danger comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the eye of Richard’s eyes swept over Achilles, and the strange expression of the dark priest suddenly gave him a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt an idea in his heart, and Achilles would not know the things of the hunter, though it was unintentionally exerted through the blue fire. The ability to hunt souls, but Asiris is keenly aware, maybe he has already felt something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha calmly collected the soul and said, "It’s okay, continue to explore, be careful, and most of the hidden The enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling in the hall is still running, and the source of the Faro’s plane is constantly pumping, and the bones in the deep pool have been moved out. They all became the food of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starbone's cheekbones are extremely hard, and the mother's nest took a full three days to bite and smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete star-headed skull is the most dangerous existence. It can be turned into stardust only by gaze, but it is lost in the bone state. Richard retains the skull and hopes to resolve some rules of ability. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three deep pools now, replaced by dense giant eggs, which constantly absorb energy. If you listen carefully, you can still hear those inside the eggshell. A heavy heartbeat of a creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These giant eggs are the creation of the mother's nest, half of them are soldiers of giant blood, and half are beasts with blood of stars and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now understood the principles of the parent nest to resolve the biological race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is swallowed by biological individuals, parsed in the body, the more the number of swallowed, the greater the number of samples analyzed, the corresponding process will be shorten. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the mother nest thoroughly understands the structure of a race, it can also be targeted to improve, thus creating a more powerful new warrior, such as the current nest If you create a barbarian warrior, then the upper limit is not the natural level of the barbarian race, but the fifteenth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the creator creation is a soulless soul. Only the elite created by the addition of divinity is the life of self-awareness. Deep field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hundred giant eggs in the three giant pools, which will replace the mother nest to provide energy for the giant eggs, for them to grow completely, about After a month, the giant egg will become a powerful warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a few days, on the side of the valley, the mother's nest created a small wormwood forest, and a fleshy giant python in the forest. The giant dragonfly of the flying dragonfly is still huge, I don’t know what is being cultivated inside, and the mother nest itself is motionless and diligently digesting the newly acquired three skeletons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has begun work that can never be done again. On his workbench, there is a three-dimensional magical image, which is the internal structure of the mountain belly. As the worker bees continue to dig deeper, this structure is more and more refined. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently calculated the flow of the power of the surface of a meeting, and then reached out to outline a few lines on the structure drawing, and continued to go deep into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
