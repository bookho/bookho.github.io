There is no water, green and life here, only flames and ashes, but the world is not calm, it just died. Because the flames are still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world suddenly trembled a bit, and you can see a huge crack suddenly appearing on the burning scorpion, revealing the dark, fangs, almost half a sky. There are countless fires that are silently dumped from the cracks, such as a raging waterfall that slowly falls on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the scorched earth was swept away again, and the embers became gray, everything happened in the deepest silence, because all the energy of the world is visible and invisible. The imaginary and tangible, violently boiling in every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stand in the middle of the world, you can't hear the sound, but you can feel the trembling of the world, like the desperate struggle before dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the world is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep crack in the earth, and from time to time it will spray a dark black turbid wave, but it is not water, but turbid thick energy As soon as they leave the ground, they will burn fiercely, forming a horrible fire column with a few kilometers of thickness. However, as the temperature continues to rise, the deep red flame gradually becomes transparent and finally fades into the world's last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the wind, there is only a hot invisible airflow, and when it rolls over the earth, all slightly fragile objects will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is mountainous, with old mountains, and the earth is cracking and tremors to form new highlands, so one after another, the shortest and several kilometers high The ridges are criss-crossed on the earth, and their shapes are strange and entangled with each other, like the scars on the heart of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plains of the distance, you can still see the ruins of the city and the dry riverbed. There have been countless living creatures living here, and left their own brand on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these long-lasting brands are so insignificant that they can’t stand the devastating destruction of the fire, and it is foreseeable that when the world stops breathing completely, The last fatal breath will erase all traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning scorpio is also as weak as it starts to appear with a big or small wound, some are still pouring fire, others are shaking and healing However, it can already be seen, and then there is nothing but the darkest darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the earth and the sky, there are large and large bands of magnificent light. They float and dance, appear without warning, and disappear silently. But where the light passes, there will be a large blank, cutting out nothing in this red and black world, as if it was erased by an invisible but omnipotent hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any powerful life from the main plane will recognize the origin of these light belts, and thus panic, that is the light belt that represents the turbulent flow of time, that After a splendid light curtain, it is actually another world. It may be a new and powerful plane, or it may be a deadly Jedi. It is more likely to be a space composed of violent energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the spewing from the earth, and falling from the sky, is not a fire, but the source of the existence of the plane, when the source is When the wound is wound, the plane is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the world, there is a mountain, the mountain is not high, not majestic, but at this moment it is particularly eye-catching, because in this world that is dying The mountain seems to be protected by invisible forces, and it still maintains its original appearance. There are even grasses and trees on the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the grass leaves are soaked in blood, and the trunk is also stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the slopes, there are corpses everywhere, humans, and more are human races that cannot be named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses of humans and aliens are intertwined, the weights of the limbs overlap, and the complete armor or clothing is not visible, and the weapons are often seen from one body. Tuck into another body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is still possible to faintly identify each human corpse, and there will be several heterogeneous corpses stacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer to the top of the mountain, the denser the body, the more wounds there are, the better the armor equipment of the soldiers, and the many aliens who are not equipped are also obviously More tyran than the same family under the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mountainside, the ratio of the strong appearing is getting higher and higher, they can withstand more damage, and can cause more destruction, but they All have one thing in common, that is, it has been dead for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely fierce battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, there are some races that should not appear on the ordinary plane. They have golden blood regardless of their shape. At this time, those The blood is also scattered on the earth, but the blood that is dark and dry in the dark is different in the soil. The gold-like trickle crawls on the ground. It seems that the sky has already disappeared from the stars, and it is constantly emitting silk. Awkward divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is centered on the top of the mountain, forming a large circle, but with a natural gap on one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the earth from the sky, there is a huge scar that comes straight from the top, then stops, the ground of the rock cracks out of the bottomless Gully, at first, the near-earth part can still see the crust that has been rubbed for hundreds of millions of years. The bottom is full of energy waves, and the flames are splashed. However, the most hot is the fog of the flames. What kind of terrorist attack is necessary to open the earth to leave this scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the forefront of the scar, on the small flat slope of the top of the mountain, there is a figure that is not so tall, but will make the students look up, it is a man The sword is standing, and his eyes are staring into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible attack stopped at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beside him, a tall man with a deep black armor is kneeling on one knee, and most of the spikes on the armor are damaged. After a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two figures standing in a row, there is an open space, and there are still green grasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the edge of the grass, it is a fierce battlefield. In the staggered corpse, two thick and large armored warriors are particularly eye-catching. In front of them, the bodies of aliens even pile up into mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s two of Kailan and Capita, the 13th Gordon of the Gordon. If you continue to look at it, you can also search for other members of the 13th Cavaliers. They are now turned into corpses, but like Kailan and Kade, there are piles of sturdy bodies like mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indescribable war. The beginning of the war is the slap in the face of tearing the sky and the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gordon naturally stood at the forefront, keeping all followers and fighters behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the enemy appeared like a tidal wave, washed away with this lonely mountain, and then disappeared on the road leading to the peak, the warrior Killed with the knights one by one, fell on this magical lonely mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war has not known how long it has passed, Gordon is still standing, he is like the past, standing at the top, standing in the forefront, standing on everyone Where you dare not set foot, stand in the place that belongs only to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fearless, he is the king of eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is dead, but one person is still alive, it is Modred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the name of the devil squats, waiting patiently, the time seems to have stopped flowing in the moment of the world’s death, in the same battle-scarred boots , rolling a few heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is very similar to human beings, but there are differences. They are majestic and imposing, even if they are dead, they also want to worship, they want to worship. With golden eyes, golden blood on the broken mouth, hair is also golden, and there is still no wind and dance, no, if you look closely, you will find that it is not a blond hair, but a burning power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several heads were thrown on the grass, mud, and even one of the steel boots that were still stepping on Modred, half of the The faces didn't go into the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every skull has a common feature, that is, it is burning with desperate power, and wants to completely turn itself into ashes. The magic power they emit is incomparably pure and powerful, just like the body is completely condensed by divine power. In fact, at this time, the gods in the skull have dissipated, and as the plane of the plane disappears, the priesthood has long since disappeared. They do not even want to sleep in the astral world. They only want to be vain, but they are forbidden by the power of terror. It can only maintain the form of matter and accept the shame of trampling and dyeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly raised his head and there was dust falling from the helmet. Obviously he has kept this position for a long time, so that his body has accumulated dust, he After the mask, the bottomless eyes are no longer dark red like plasma. The black is like the sky without the stars. He looks at Gordon. After a long time, the depths of his eyes are full of despair. Then a wild beast sighs from the depths of the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My King..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred finally stood up, his The movements are stiff and stiff, and the joints of the armor are not colliding with each other. The bones inside the body are creaking. I don’t know how long it has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally stood up and landed heavily on the ground, as if the entire mountain was trembled, and the head that was originally underfoot was The slamming sound burst open, the golden blood brain was smashed, and the golden flame formed by the burning of the gods rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it still can’t dissipate, it’s been squeezed to become a head of debris, still desperately keeping the material, it seems to be in such a shameful form eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the action of Modred, the mountain vibrates, and the body of Gordon is affected, shaking, and Modred’s eyes are stunned. He extended his hand to Gotton, but his movements were in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon swayed and stood there again, and the giant sword he was squatting turned into a fly ash in front of Modred’s eyes, and then The wind is annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, a heavy sigh was heard on the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Modred has long known that there is no life in Gordon’s body, but he still wants to wait, waiting for the moment of miracle, he believes His own king will create a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
