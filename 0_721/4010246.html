			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a neatly placed shelf on the south side of the lab. Seal the box. Those are the semi-finished products that he left for Qi Qi to package the finished. He silently clicked on the number and found that there were actually twenty-one magic boxes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 It takes about three days to complete a semi-finished product, that is, she has not rested for a day in three months. As if working at the same time, and apparently the level of drawing the structure has improved. And when Richard went away, he naturally took the artifact magic pen away, leaving it to a fine-level spare magic pen. This magic pen is enough for an apprentice apprentice, but it seems a bit rude for a formal builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basicly, every semi-finished product that Qi Qi has completed now allows Richard to save half a day, that is, the twenty-six semi-finished products can be Richard Save at least ten days. For Richard, who is very concerned about time, the meaning is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood behind Qi Qi, until she saw that she had drawn a line, she called: "珞琪."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi looked up and looked at Richard in amazement, and then a faint smile: "Master, you are back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard looked at the dress she was drawing, nodded and said 'very good'. Then point out a few places that need improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these needs to be improved, Qi Qi frowned and said, "I don't know why, every time I get here, my magic output always becomes Very unstable, it is difficult to control the magic pen in his hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so stunned, Qi Qi is only a nine-level magician, and is just Promoted to come up. If you want to draw perfectly in these transitions, you must be at least a 12th-level magician. With the support of the two great gods, I also made a perfect drawing at the tenth level. Now that Qi Qi can finish it at the ninth level, it is already quite rare, and the talented apprentice apprentice, It may not be possible to draw at this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he thought about it, he said, "In this time, you should spend more time on meditation and raise the magic as soon as possible. Wait until you reach ten." Level, I will teach you a brand new meditation, "Dark Blue Fantasy.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Qi Qi to be surprised and shouted: "Is it Su The dark blue meditation of His Highness Helen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the Qi Qi was beyond the expectations of Richard. He questioned: "It is indeed a teacher's meditation. But I am teaching you only the preliminary version. This is not a secret spell. What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 sighed softly, his head hangs down, after a while I said, "It seems that you don't know the preciousness of deep blue meditation. But you are not afraid that I will betray one day. After all, my name is Mensa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard smiled a few times and reached out and patted Qi Qi’s face and said, "Nyris and I have talked about this. I promised him, I will not give you the opportunity to betray me. Actually nothing. Than a betrayal of a future holy builder Adding something terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪展颜一笑, said: "You are so confident that you will become a holy builder?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a confidence, but a promise, a promise that must be completed." Richard suddenly thought of the dreamy night, and the incredible deep blue sigh. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Luo Qi suddenly a kind of wonderful feeling that package as St. division does not seem to end future Richard. The boy in front of him seems to be looking farther every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard went to the shelf and opened a box to remove the semi-finished product inside, and looked very satisfied with Qi Qi’s handwork. . Then some curiously asked: "Qi Qi, have you been painting in the past three months, have you not rested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Isn't it a break when meditation?" said Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent, this sentence is very familiar, he still remembers to answer the Magisters more than once in the dark blue. I did not expect to hear it in the mouth of Qi Qi today. In fact, more than once, Richard saw his own shadow from Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you so desperate? Are you not tired?" asked Li. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; recklessly in front of Luo Qi Long Long amount, tranquil said: "Now that I've been dreaming of past life, how will be tired?" <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Okay, Qi Qi, I still have one thing, I need to hear your thoughts. Lina’s recent situation is not very good, and I heard that in the past she sold all her epic gear in order to maintain the situation in the Greenson plane. So I am going to give her some compensation now, do you say that she is giving her epic equipment directly, or make a piece for her? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your purpose is to make her mood better, and to improve the strength, is it?" Qi Qi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Richard nodded. In grasping the hearts of the people, Qi Qi is a good hand, not everyone can give the sand to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi thought about it and said, "The suggestion is that you can directly give her the gold coins that can be purchased in epic gear, let her choose how to do it herself. At the same time, in order to give her a better mood, you can choose to send some small gifts, not much money, as long as you can show your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Small gift?" Gold coins are not a problem, but small gifts make Richard difficult. In addition to his hand, there is nothing to be sent out as a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you need it, I have a small gift here." Then, Qi Qi took out a small box and sent it to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the box and saw that there were two earrings on it, a pale gold oval ring with a drop of black crystal. The material used in this pair of earrings, Richard can almost feel his eyes closed, all the most commonly used materials when drawing the structure. This pair of ingenious earrings is actually made of the remaining corners of the magic material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this what you did?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, in order to practice the stability of your hands. Also...that, I occasionally want some accessories. Girls like these." Spit down the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little action made Richard feel more close to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why don’t you buy some?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi shrugged and said: “No money, no time, no chance! In the place of Green Forest "I want it, how do I buy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without time and no chance, it is understandable, without money, suddenly let Richard think, Originally from the acquisition of Qi Qi, I did not give her money. Of course, it wasn't until recently that she couldn't let her go shopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi said to Richard: "I think, for the current Lina, this pair of earrings is worth more attention than epic equipment! But You have to say that this is what you personally do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! This is not so good!" Richard said stunnedly. The value of the earring itself is not much, but if it is done by him, it has other implications. Moreover, taking what Qi Qiqi did, pretending to be his own, Richa always felt that he could not do such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is bad." Qi Qi put the jewelry box in the lid and stuffed it into Richard's pocket and said, "Lina is important to you now. And my time is not worth it. A little lie can make Lina feel better, and it can save you a lot of time without hurting anyone. Why not? Go! You want Become a person who can't betray us. If we can't bear such a small amount of power, how can we convince us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, similarly, he seems to have heard it too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Richard took a picture of Qi Qi’s face and left the magic lab to find Lina. It was not until after he left the lab that Richard remembered where he had heard similar words. It was the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic tower of the outermost city of the base city, Dragon Master Lina is as lazily leaning on the sofa as she used to, looking out at the window. Green, I don't know what I am thinking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when she is alone, she will take off the mask on her face. At the moment, she wore a black magician's robes, which is the most common style. Although she can also outline her hot body curves, she is wrapped very tightly. The savage robes of those deep V open collars are now lying in the closet honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina! It's me, Richard." The voice of Richard came from outside the door. Lina shuddered and hurriedly agreed. She grabbed the mask in a hurry, and finally buckled her face, tied her belt, and then took a few deep breaths to calm the heartbeat, and then rushed to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood outside the door, looking pretty, clean and sunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it so slow?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, busy with sorting things... Come in!" Lina didn't seem to be good at lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Dragon Master’s room, Richard smoothly closed the door behind him, and looked around the room and seemed to have a little change in the room. Sit on the chair next to the sofa. But in this way, the only place left for Lina in the living room is the sofa, and her habit is that the sofa is used for lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Lina would lie down unceremoniously, regardless of this position, which would allow Richard to see deep content in her chest. But today, she is sitting on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
