			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and return to Noland, by a great wizard who is well versed in alchemy After engraving the magical array and inspiring the power of the shadow drill, the box becomes a magic box with a space effect. Two shadow drills can make the inner space of the surface of the box-shaped magic box reach two cubic meters. The power of the isolated space with the shadow drill can also produce a complete weight loss effect. As long as the items placed in the magic box are no more than two tons, what Richard feels is only the weight of the magic box itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic box itself has reached the level of epic items, even if you do not consider the material, the cost of work is expensive. In the end, under the insistence of Ba Moore, it was a symbol of friendship in the Kingdom of the Furnace, and there was no charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time on the border of the furnace kingdom, Richard’s logistics team has arrived. In the cheers of thousands of dwarves, one barrel and one bag of food were removed from the truck. Subsequently, a large number of weapons, metal ingots, ores and bundles of muskets and dozens of barrels of gunpowder were loaded onto the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of wine and food brought by Richard is nearly one million gold coins, especially for food. The dwarves pay 150 gold coins per ton of food. High price, and willingly. Strong dwarves eat much more than ordinary humans. A dwarf eats at least one ton of food a year. Richard has shipped 3,000 tons of food, which means that the furnace kingdom can feed an additional 3,000 dwarves. And Richard will continue to ship food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the rich and powerful Faro, the human kingdom is not short of food. In the rich grain-producing area, one ton of grain can be purchased for only twenty gold coins. Of course, if you ship to the pale highlands, you need at least 50 gold coins per ton of freight. If the vast amount of materials exchanged from the dwarf kingdom is returned to the human kingdom, the value will be multiplied several times, and the final value will reach five million gold coins. Crossing the blood-stained land requires a distance of thousands of kilometers. Large-scale caravans can travel two to three times a year. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening the passage to the pale highlands, the super-large-scale caravans were able to pass through the blood-stained land, and the material transportation could be carried out on the scale of 1,000 tons for the first time. Richard is also preparing to set up two large replenishment camps in the original Kano Vincent camp and the Cracked Rock Canyon for resupply to the caravans and to station heavy troops to maintain the safety of the entire trade route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t consider the future caravan revenue, it’s just the line plan itself, and the revenue is more than five million. After deducting the cost, freight and military expenses generated by the war, there will still be nearly two million net profit. For Richard, he will get a quarter of this income, which will be 1.2 million. And because his troops are not slaves or parent-fighting units, the original damage is lower than the aristocratic army, and the pension is much lower. Therefore, in fact, Richard’s expenditure is much less than that of other nobles, and the total is about 500,000. Therefore, Richard’s final direct harvest is 700,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening the crossroads of the blood-stained land, the same size caravan can maintain two, totaling five times a year between the furnace kingdoms. Of course, it is impossible for the size of the caravan to be such a huge logistics team, but there will be no such big casualties and no huge pensions. Therefore, the net profit of each caravan should be around 2 million. Therefore, the profit generated by this trade route will be around 10 million per year, and the value is completely incalculable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the initial agreement with the nobility, Richard will occupy a quarter of the final interest of the business. In other words, as long as the passage to the pale highlands is controlled, Richard's annual income will be 2.5 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Richard’s actual gains go far beyond this. In Zhu Buval, Li Chaguang is worth six or seven million worth of rare materials. The value of the books and the blood of the Holy Spirit cannot be measured. The divine statues that have been plundered from the orcs and the various barbarian tribes are equally difficult to describe. If you must find a measure, that is the difference between the seventh-order mother's nest and the sixth-order mother's nest, which is the value of these divinities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the line, this crazy adventure has finally succeeded, and the harvest is equally crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge force returned slowly, and Richard left a thousand garrison troops in each of the scheduled supply camps, Canovanson and the Cracked Rock Canyon. The huge slave orders have been sent to the major business groups, and soon the two camps will each have 10,000 slaves to arrive and start construction work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to the Blue Water Oasis, it was nearly three months away from the second Western Expedition. The Blue Water Oasis City has regained its vitality, and a large number of simple houses have been built. Every day, a large number of adventurers flock to the Oasis City from the human kingdom to begin their adventure in the bloody land. Richard has not returned to Oasis City, and the news of the success of the Longitudinal Plan has already been transmitted in the Sequoia Kingdom and quickly passed to several neighboring countries. When the information is transmitted several times, it becomes a rumor, and it is an absurd legend to pass it a few times. Later, in the afternoon tea time, in the mouth of the nobles, the ore in the Richard Car has turned into gems and gold, and the length of the team has also expanded several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood-staining, from a dangerous place of death overnight to a wealth of gold everywhere, it is said that there is a possibility of digging a shovel here. To gold. So countless criminals, thieves, thieves, adventurers, in short, all those who can't be mixed in the human kingdom flock to the blood-stained land and flock to the place where this dream begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Oasis City, Richard immediately faced how to divide. The great success of the line plan and the huge benefits that come with it are enough to make people crazy. How to divide this cake is the root of the dispute between the nobility. What Richard cares about is not just how the cake should be cut, but also how to ensure that the cake is not caught by others. Fortunately, at this point, all the aristocratic interests involved in the long-term plan are consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is the Masters Association. Richard believes that the last contact is enough to show his attitude. If the Master Association has retreated, the Richard does not mind making some concessions. He does not intend to really cooperate with the Masters Association, but only to delay the time. The biggest advantage of Noland is that the strong and the mage, Richard can easily recruit dozens of ten-level mages in Noland, and can purchase the fine-level enchanting equipment in batches, and these two are the masters. The foundation on which the association depends. In this regard, Richard does not see at all that in the future of his own planning, there is no need to retain the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the harvest of the Dwarf Kingdom, Richard has pre-extracted his own income. What he got was mainly the fine weapons made by the dwarves and the forged black Yao iron ingots. These dwarven weapons are all made of high-quality forged black ferroniobium, which is better than Richard's Raffa fine iron weapon obtained from Noland. The number of these weapons reached more than four hundred, and Richard is ready to transport them all back to Noland, and after being enchanted by the Master, they will be transported back to Faro for sale. In addition, Richard also received five pieces of private gifts from Barmo. These weapons are also based on the forged black stellite iron, but they are black sputum iron on the artifact anvil, which is qualitatively different from ordinary black scorpion iron. These black irons are endowed with power by the artifacts, and naturally have tough attributes. And Bamore's outstanding skills add a sharp attribute to these weapons. This is the uniqueness of the dwarf forge masters, and the boutiques they produce will be accompanied by the same natural attributes. This property can be superimposed with the enchantment effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Moore's double-edity boutiques, with the addition of two magic effects, can reach the level of epic items. In the life of Ba Moore, there are occasionally three attributes of the best. And such a best product, has the basis of legendary equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five weapons that Richard received were two warhammers, two one-handed axes and one two-handed axe, all in the style of a dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
