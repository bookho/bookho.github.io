Its body power is actually very large, constantly pushing down the trees in front, leaving a very eye-catching passage in the forest. After the last big tree crashed down, the goblin camp was completely in the field of view of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp occupies the top of the entire hill, and the surrounding is also trunked with rough and simple walls. There are a variety of indescribable shacks in the camp, and more are openings to the underground. Many goblins are more accustomed to living in underground caves, and only a goblin with a certain identity and status can live in the shack built. The land that enters and exits is so dense that it is not a small camp with only two hundred goblins, but a large tribe with a number of thousands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack started without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless gnomes across the ground, carrying a variety of weapons rushing out of the camp. Their opponents are nine large worker bees with a body size of more than one and a half meters. The powerful and powerful mouth of the worker bees and the sharp blade are deadly weapons. Every time they fly, they will bite and bite a goblin. However, the number of goblins is too much. A worker bee has been slightly slower to escape. At the same time, several goblins have been thrown onto the body, and the action is not delayed. Then dozens of goblin rushed to the worker bee and buried it alive! In the consciousness of the mother's nest, the life of this worker bee quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low humming sound in the woods, and the three fast-moving beasts of the size of the wolf king rushed out and threw themselves into the group of the goblins, and immediately set off a storm. They are specialized combat units and are not the same as the worker bees who collect food. Two long blades can easily cut the goblin into two pieces, and after strengthening the power, the blade will strike the whole force at one time, often cutting a few goblin bodies! Even more deadly is the big mouth of the fast-moving beast. Just bite a bit, even the strongest goblin will be torn off to the half body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the fast-moving beast is strong and fast-moving. The attack of the goblin is not to measure the past, but to scratch the epidermis shallowly, and rarely penetrate them. body. So after the three savage beasts joined, the goblin tribe became a one-sided slaughter. When the huge and terrible figure of the mother's nest appeared outside the camp, the courage of the goblin finally collapsed, even though they killed more than 200 warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblins rushed into the forest from all directions. The slow-moving mother-in-law was unable to chase them, but directed the fast-moving beast and several worker bees to chase down. Although the combat power of the goblin is extremely weak, but the speed of this small thing to escape is not slow, with the limited number of fast beasts and worker bees, within the safe distance of the nest, up to more than 100 can be killed. This action to hunt food is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest continues to climb into the camp and ignores the food on the ground. It feels that there is something in the goblin camp that attracts it. That is An unclear wave of volatility and a call to the soul level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fence of the goblin camp was like a dead straw in front of the nest, and was easily pushed down and leveled. It climbed to the center of the camp and finally stopped on a stone bench with an altar. The feeling of attracting it is from the altar just two meters high. For the goblin, this altar can be a magnificent building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone statue erected on the altar, engraved with a heavily armed goblin, holding a ‘big axe’ with both hands. The carvings of the stone statues are surprisingly vivid and vivid, and are quite different from the generally chaotic style of the goblin community. The goblin on the statue was calm and dignified, revealing a murderous murderousness, which was originally impossible to appear in the goblin, but appeared on the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancestor worship! This statue is the object of worshipping the goblins of the camp, and it is also a great attraction to the mother nest. I did not expect the goblin here to know the ancestor worship. From the traces of weathering and erosion on the edge of the statue, at least centuries of history, the worship and beliefs of countless goblins over the centuries have given the statue a power similar to divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is the source of attracting and calling the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest firmly propped up the body, expanding the mouthparts to the extreme, and then swallowing the goblin statue all over the belly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After swallowing the idol, it didn’t stop there, but began cutting the altar with a small blade and a powerful mouthpiece. The altar made of stone is fragile and soft in front of it, like freshly baked bread, cut off easily by pieces, and then swallowed into the belly by the mother nest. This age-old altar also carries a fascinating power, although it is far less powerful than the goblin statue, but the nest is not ready to be wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin statue melts rapidly in the mother's nest, and a fierce pain like a flame burns in the mother's nest, which is the power of faith. Being destroyed, broken down, absorbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mother's nest, what's wrong with you?" The voice of Richard came from the consciousness of the mother's nest. He felt the pain of the mother's nest and asked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest said: "I don't care, master. I found an altar of ancestor worship in the goblin camp. It has exactly the special power I need. The evolutionary process was greatly promoted, so the whole altar was eaten. It is difficult and digestive to digest and decompose this power, but in addition, it only takes some time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The altar of ancestor worship? Can you absorb the power?" Richard was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this power called divine power? But according to my feelings, it is not as profound as the power of the real god. For example, the power of the Miss Sands is I can't absorb it at all," said the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said: "The flowing sand has the power of the dragon of eternal and time, even if it is the god of the main plane, nor can it be with the eternal and time. The existence of the dragon is beautiful, or there is a stronger existence in the depths of the infinite plane, but at least not what we can now know. What benefits does the mother's nest and the ancestor worship bring to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't fully absorbed it. Now, it just increases the amount of energy I have to store." The hen answered. In Richard's consciousness, the colored bars that represent the energy reserve in the image of the mother's nest began to expand, and more than a third have been added to stop growing. This means that now that the mother's nest is fully fed, it can create twelve powerful beasts. In the deepest part of the mother's nest, it is also the most rigorous position, and there is a blurry spot. The meaning of this spot is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating the altar, the mother's nest began to eat, and the energy reserve began to rise slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful town on the banks of the river less than ten kilometers from the Baron. Sir Kokot’s territory is located here. This territory is not only convenient for transportation, but also rich in specialties. The mackerel produced in the river is delicious and delicious. It is a common food on the aristocratic table. Relying on the richness of the territory, Sir Cokat even built a small castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of this castle still retains the traditional style of high walls and narrow windows, but the interiors are very gorgeous, the compartments are also very tasteful and comfortable, not war For the purpose, even in the upper part of the castle broke the tradition, creating a small semi-circular terrace extending in the air, so that the castle owner can better appreciate the scenery in his leisure time. The style of the castle is like Jazz himself. He prefers to use gold coins and politics to solve opponents instead of passing swords and war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
