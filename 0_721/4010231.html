			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual Royal Auction is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This auction is particularly hot, so that the coming VIPs are full of excuses. Both the fruit of life and the blood crystal have sold the price of nearly ten million gold coins. This is something that can't be bought with money. It has always been possible only at some top private auctions. In the words of some big aristocrats who have always been aggressive, things that can be solved with Magic Crystal are not called things. They don't bother to say things with gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear of the Son of the Forest was identified as a legendary level, but only 2 million were sold due to excessive restrictions on full power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final price of the set secret guide is 550 million. This figure looks even a bit low, and the enemies of Richard are relieved. In their calculations, it is not bad that Richard does not lose money on this suit. However, despite this, the prospects that Richard gradually showed were enough to make them feel breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plot against Richard was not so much to destroy a potential threat to the future, but actually to fight Gotton. But now the little threat itself has grown to the point where they feel suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other five pieces of Richard's other parts sold for more than two million, and the price was slightly unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction was over. Calculating the income at the auction, Richard was surprised to find that his account was close to 15 million. Counting the various materials shipped from Greenson, it is just over 15 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of it, Richard couldn’t help but raise an idea: How can it become rich again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the architect is likened to a gold mine, then the builder with a success rate such as Richard is equipped with the Dragon Blood Gnome automatic gold mining. Open-pit gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha directly purchased the magic material worth 3 million through Nyris, and sent the magic crystal of the past 2 million to the black dwarf. Eight million enchanted equipment, and then found that there is not much left in his hand. The gold coins rolled in and rolled away, but Richard did not know what he had left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not important to leave anything now. Richard returned to the floating island and asked the old butler to explain something, and he called Faschi into the study. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To clean up, we set off in an hour and went to the territory of Count Earl," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi’s inexplicable tremble, said: “Ah! How come so fast, in addition, what to do in the Earl Territory?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha strangely said: "Of course, fulfilling the gambling promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so busy, how can you run the Earl Terri Just for this little thing?” Faschi seemed to have some gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is there something small about the Archimonde goddess?" Richard said with a smile, then moved out of a medium-sized box and opened it. The faint magic light inside suddenly spurted out. A whole set of seven wild barriers is lying in the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Faschi's voice was so dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven sets of wild barriers are better than the original version. I have made special improvements, and now they are full second-order suits." When I talk about my work, I am naturally full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, seven sets... Richard, really want to leave now?" Faschi asked a strange question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Fasqi inexplicably and asked: "I was not talking about Norand human lingua franca?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the elf language that I have been thinking about in my mind." Faschi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Elvish?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little bit, I want to learn from you!" Faschi said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I teach you! Go find a magician and learn. Ok, go clean up, I will only wait for you for an hour!" Say, pull out the map of Noland and start researching the route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi finally held the last glimmer of hope and said, "Well, I will arrange the carriage. It is a very good carriage, very comfortable." Let's go early tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyebrows gradually lock up and the smile on his face fades away, saying: "Faschi, I am with you." Consultation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a kind of indescribable majesty in the face of Richard’s face. Faschi shuddered, biting his lower lip, struggling in despair, and asked, "So how do we go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is a gryphon Go! I have prepared four griffins, and on the road, I can fly to the Earl Castle in six hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six... six hours!" Faschi's mouth can be stuffed into a duck egg! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you only have one hour to prepare! Go ahead, and, don't forget to inform the count, I hope to have dinner with her tonight." Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need two hours!" Faschi gritted his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked coldly: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the count that time is needed, I haven’t taken a bath today, I have to change my clothes, and I have to pack my clothes... I am a woman!” Faschi continued to grit his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One and a half hours! Otherwise I will go by myself." Richard said that this is his last bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well." Faschi was unable to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half, Faschi rushed to the Griffin Field, still five minutes late, and it is said that she and the count of the magic signal path led by the count So I just sent a message informing that Earl of Allie, Richard, is about to travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and pointed at the gryphon next to him and said, "Go up, let's go now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi tightened the strap of the backpack and jumped onto the back of the griffon, then looked sideways at Richard. Richard also carried a backpack with a enchanted box, hung two long knives on the back of the lion's cub, and then put a hand on the back of the lion's cub, and the body fell together in a strange way, and crossed the lion's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of Richard’s movements is not at all ethereal, but surprisingly fast, and the energy consumed is exceptionally small. If this style is used on the battlefield, the power is extraordinarily large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi was shocked. I don’t know why, she felt that she had seen the shadow of the white night from the newly discovered Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the clear tweet, the four lions flew up from the floating island, then hovered over half of the circle and began to fly to Ellie Earl Territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is the one flying in the front, observing the terrain all the way, and comparing it with the map in his memory, correcting the route from time to time. In this long-range flight, Richard is more convinced of his wisdom and true talent, and has no intention of letting Faschi lead the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the follower of Faschi is completely desperate, and she has lost her chance to fly the wrong way. Watching a town pass from the foot, she wants to try to tell Richard that the direction is wrong, and then deliberately take the road off. But I don't know why, watching her watch the gryphon without hesitation, she did not hesitate to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four lions flew from high altitude without stopping. The clouds are just above the head, seemingly within reach, the wind is hard and cold, flying for a long time, even Faschi feels very uncomfortable. However, the Richard in front seemed to be unaffected, and the figure on the back of the lion was motionless for a long time, occasionally adjusting the sitting position very finely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours later, Richard led the lion to fall on a meadow, to feed the lion to drink the vitality, and to throw the freshly prepared meat. Give them. After twenty minutes of rest, Richard and Faschi each transferred to a gryphon that had never been loaded and continued on the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl Castle of Elliott, named No Fire Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a castle based on deep red. As the years go by, the outer wall is gradually stained with large black spots, looking at it as if it were half Solidified magma. At this time, it was near dusk, and the falling sun was a layer of lazy red for the castle and the city that was stretched out at the foot of the castle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the top of the castle, the female god of war in the hearts of the landlords, Count Ellie is walking back and forth in her own study. She suddenly grabbed a piece of paper on the desk and looked at it again. She slammed it into a ball and threw it into the paper basket. But she felt that she still didn't hate it. She reached out and took the ball out of it. Then she took a look at her hands and the smoke was everywhere. The paper was ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter paper has been destroyed, but the contents of the paper have long been engraved in the mind of Ellie, lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the content on the letter is very simple, it is a password generated by a line of magic signals, expressed in words: "Licha is expected to arrive in seven and a half hours. Piaget collar, he brought seven sets of suits, all second-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seven sets of suits!" Ellie slammed her red short hair and bite bitterly With your teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven sets of suits, actually got it out? When did the suit knight become so worthless, can it appear in less than a year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
