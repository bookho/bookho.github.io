For example, I am very willing to go to your home to see if there is anything good. Let me 'expropriate' it." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha..." Lawrence wanted to say something to Richard, but Richard lifted his hand and stopped the old man's dissuasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around for a week and said, "I have said that I have said that the essence of this matter is when I am desperate to clean up the enemy camp, okay? It’s easy to come back alive, but I’ve found that I’m 'expropriated’ to my own home. I’m a builder, and I’ve been in the dusk for more than a year, but I’ve never had a big magister. I think everyone is very clear, so here, I am firmly opposed to this expropriation. The reason why I tamed a living demon is to make a breakthrough in the construction, if it can be targeted at the characteristics of Dakso Das. It is not the most needed for the twilight land to adjust the performance of the building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard are powerful and equally convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as soon as I saw the expression of everyone, Richard’s heart sank, and Richard suddenly turned his head and said to Hastings: “Hers Under the court of the court, or what you need to exchange, the composition is still the top sacrifice, I can also use life to pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin Haze A long laugh: "The little guy is more precious to me than anything. You just use vavond. It doesn't matter. You need to vote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Richard looked around again and took everyone's expressions to his eyes. Suddenly said, "Everyone, if you can support me in this matter, then you will gain my goodwill, and my goodwill is cheap. The value is a custom-made third-order structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is out, everyone in the room is almost moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction is the backbone of Noland. Although they are all strong, even if they are third-order, they can’t find it. If you want to buy it, you can’t buy it. This is a common thing. If Richard’s previous description of the Dakso Das’s installation is useless, it’s useless. The third-order structure of the system is actually obtained and touched, and it can solve many people's urgent needs. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal Ronster Steader suddenly became stunned. He has always been strict and stereotyped. Wherever he wants to get Richard, he will suddenly come to this hand. This is equivalent to public bribery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, this is why." Marshal couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I don't think I need to cut the black scorpion, I can make enough contributions to the big picture, just like I did in the past." Richard said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, It’s the turn of Hasting to look around for a week, and I’ve seen everyone’s look. The legendary wizard suddenly laughed, and the laughter grew bigger and bigger. The more mad, the later, he began to cough hard, almost coughing to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to laugh at the end of the cough, Hastings gasped and said: “Lee, you know, even if it is, you can’t stop me, I I will definitely cut the little devil, slowly, thin, and lasting for a long time, not only him, but also other devils, I will grab all the demons and cut them slowly... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting's words made Richard's face look ugly, and he said faintly: "His Royal Highness, I have no objection to your hobby of cutting other demons." However, in the current situation, it seems that this expropriation will be vetoed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard raised his hand and prepared to call for a vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no, you got it wrong." Hastings frustrated his hand, and despite his excitement, his face was noticeable. And some crazy smiles: "You don't want to veto this requisition. You will even give up this vote yourself. As for the reason, it is very simple. You forgot that the little girl named Shuihua still lies with me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s hand was stiff in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Lundstedt is a glimpse, and then his face becomes ugly. If Richard’s proposal is to openly bribe, Hasting’s words are Openly, for the marshal, both are difficult to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting smiled so that all the sagging skin on his face began to shake: "The little girl needs me to treat her twice again, the soul can The repair is complete, and both treatments need to be completed in an hour. If the time limit is exceeded, I can't guarantee that her soul will be intact. Don't expect other people to save her, even if she is protected by her soul. That person, the accomplishments in this respect are not comparable to me, even I have paid a huge price for it. Who else can save her, you don’t want to believe me, try it, vote, please , please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s forehead began to ooze sweat, and the hand that was stiff in the air suddenly had invisible tremors, and Hasting had more quirks. However, there is also the minimum dignity of the legendary Master. In this case, he did not, and did not bother to lie, Richard's hand was so stiff, and then suddenly recovered, heavily on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin laughed even more wickedly, and he spread his hands and said, "I like to watch the struggle of the soul. Your present expression is really wonderful." However, time is limited, Richard is the time to make a choice, how, who do you want, water, or that, oh, that black."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and opened again a second later, holding the last hope and asked: "I want to choose all, the conditions are up to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hasting shakes his finger and says, "No, no, no, no, no, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Richard never thought about. The situation, the choice has actually returned to his hands, but he would rather have no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is getting pale and his eyes are getting sharper and sharper. Hastings does not hesitate to look at Richard, and Richard may be surprised. Extremely beautiful, perhaps with a great future, but at the moment of his eyes, the power gap between him and Hastings is simply irreparable, and the current situation is not something that can be solved by force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally closed his eyes and slowly leaned back on the chair and said calmly: "I, give up... vote."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting laughed and clap his head and said, "It's a very wise choice. You can pick it up after an hour. Don't forget to bring two sacrifices. This is the cost of treatment."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, stood up and turned away, no more votes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This round table has no need to vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard’s departure, the atmosphere in the hall was suppressed to the extreme. No matter whether it was Marshal or Hastings, they did not speak again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until leaving, they don’t understand too much why Richard and Hastings will argue for a demon person to this extent, one is a legendary mage, another One side is a promising builder. It is really difficult to decide between them. Fortunately, the final problem is solved, and it is solved in a way that does not require them to express their feelings. This makes them secretly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the people present can see that the relationship between Richard and Hastings has obviously fallen below freezing point, the battle for the sunset capital It is not good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence was also caught in the crowd, ready to leave, the marshal stopped him, and when all the others left, the marshal asked: "Hid Royal Lawrence, but a Only the devil, Richard will get to this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence sighed and looked up and marshaled, although Marshal Ronald Teddy The old man must be taller than a few heads, but at this moment, the momentum of the two sides is quite comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a devil. Why isn’t His Royal Highness will not give up? If it’s as an understatement as you say, why wait? If you don't, you must use the means of expropriation. "Laurence's tone is not without sarcasm." Richard said very clearly, he also has research needs, and after his research is over, the devil will be alive and can be reused. Use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Lundstedt glanced at Hastings and said, "His Royal Lawrence, we have known for many years, so we don't have to Euphemistic, the meaning of this demon to Hastings, the meaning of the entire field of battlefield, you should be very clear, in the entire dusk, the subordinates of magical biology, Hastings is the authority, and the field battlefield The most missing is always time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
