A painful scream in the forest followed by a fierce cough attacker was obviously stunned by the sudden acid mist. The sound target was also confirmed. The arrow formed by the magical flames is immersed in the forest. The voice of the attacker is abruptly stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After simply destroying the attackers in the forest, Richard I have time to check my environment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport "mén" is not in the military camp but built on a vacant lot outside the military camp. There is only a small team of ten soldiers guarding around. The sudden small battles that have just started here are so fast that they have not yet had time to run from the rest place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is transmitted "mén" three Ten meters away is a dense forest. The military camp is also surrounded by the forest. Only one side is "lu" in the forest. Outside the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, the Dragon Master Lina also took the "mén" from the transmission "mén" and she saw "mén" and she saw that she was full of It’s the grass leaf shards and then I saw the arrow not far away. “Sè” said, “Oh, Richard! I forgot to remind you that when you come out of the “mén”, you will sometimes be attacked by this plane warrior. Be careful of them. The bow and arrow are very powerful and often poisonous! Where did you hurt? There is no attacker where he should have not run far. I will take him over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face The late reminder and care of the god of the gods "sè" does not change, "you don't have to be killed by me"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Done?" Lina saw her. Knowing how the attackers in this plane are so much in the forest is simply their world and the best of them have a very high "shè" talent. Only the arrow's trajectory can't accurately capture their position. The general category is that even if she accidentally ran off the sneak attacker<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next attacker's magic level is second. The key is fast and correct response and high speed of casting. This high-speed and accurate response can only be formed after countless blood battles. How many battles can Richard have experienced at the age of seventeen? Is it possible to have this kind of skill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lina’s look, Richard’s heart quietly thought about whether he had done an amazing thing. But now Richard certainly doesn't write his thoughts on his face, but says to several fighters who are standing aside, "You guys are going to get the attacker's body back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several fighters hesitated, of course, they didn’t know who Richard was, but they saw that the savage magical bombardment that Richard had just counterattacked left them with a deep impression on Lina. It is rare to see such a violent indirect magic bombing and Richard's apparent relationship with Lina is extraordinary, but it is not enough for them to obey orders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a group of warriors who have been fighting for a long time. They are always on the verge of life and death. No one knows if they can live the next battle. On the battlefield, even if they are legendary, they dare. Flocking to try to use life to kill the enemy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that several fighters have no action, Lina immediately said, "This is the son of Gordon’s son, the sublime alliance of the royal family. Master's command of Master Richard is equivalent to my order!"<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors dragged a corpse back to the depths of the forest after a moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw the corpse, Lina’s curved brow could not help but lift it and then squatted on the corpse and carefully examined all the traces above. At this time, the “mén” ray was constantly flashing, sand, Nyris and Aga’s “mén” It was also the first time that they saw the indigenous corpse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is only a glance and no longer pay attention to it and Nyris and Aga "mén "The farmer's face "sè" dignified and Lina carefully around the body to check and not let go of every detail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical traces on the body are all around them. It has long been seen that the traces of two fireballs and acid mist are the most deadly flame arrows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the speed of casting from these traces is too fast. It’s almost unbelievable<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measuring the strength of a magician’s combat power There are many standard cast speeds, if not the most important ones. It’s definitely a very important one. This undoubted question lies in the speed of casting a great magician. It may be so fast that this has reached the level of many magisters<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses on the ground and the "jing" spirits of Noland are very similar. The long ears can capture the movement from the wind. Their looks are more beautiful than the "jing" spirit and a pair of large and bright eyes. The sense of smell and vision are also well-proportioned, slender body shape and The powerful muscle "rou" shows good athletic ability<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the body is mostly destroyed by magical attacks but a small part of the well-preserved skin reveals blue The green skin of the skin "sè" in the dark forest is the natural camouflage<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This native of this plane is called the forest wild "jing" by the Schumpeter family Ling Ake "méng" has also continued this name after obtaining the control of the plane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aga "mén" farmer suddenly put the body of the forest "jing" spirit Turning over a piece of tattoo totem on a piece of skin that is still intact, he scraped it down a bit. Teng paint put it in his mouth and tasted the face "sè" and said that "a strong anti-magic material is enough to offset two magic levels"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris face "sè" is also slightly changeable and can't help but look at Richard's eyebrows<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Aga "mén" farmer is certainly not surprised by the magical resistance of the forest wild "jing" spirit The strength of "xing" is rather surprised by the fact that under such a powerful magical anti-Xing, Richard's magic can also form a normal and no different injury. In addition to the speed of casting, he is lucky to be able to be lucky. Is the effect of magical spells or spell penetration? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master Lina’s face "sè" is also very "jing" color as a big magician. She has already seen that Richard's four magics are attached with spells. Penetrating effect spell penetration This is the magician's most hated super-magic effect<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Richard, her gaze is different, at least now, Lina has It is very clear that the general wizard of the same level is definitely not the opponent of Richard. The spurious speed and spell penetration effect is that Richard’s very keen warfare reaction can make him invincible in most battles. Lina knows very well that Richard's magic level is simply to suspect that the big magician's shot is just to control the magic level below the sixth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-order wisdom talent What Richard brings is ten times the speed of thinking. This is equivalent to the level of ordinary magisters. In the endless bloody battle of blood-staining, Richard has honed a very keen war response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina, Nyris and Aga "mén" farmers around the body to study the expression on the face of the non-stop face more and more "jing" color Li said that the original intention is to suppress Lina to let the dragon mage a little more I didn’t expect three people to extract a lot of things from this body. Richard’s real combat power also floated out of the water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know the thoughts of the three people, but I feel a little bit irritating and they are not very free. They don’t understand what happened. They pretended to calmly and sighed and sent Ake’s “méng” de blood. The heat spit out a lot of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat is far more intense than the hair burst. After each launch, Richard feels like the body is flowing in the magma and along with Ake. The blood of "méng" is getting stronger and stronger. Richard feels that the style of his work seems to have changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina suddenly snorted and looked up and finally The eyes fell on the body of the god, "sè" is very complicated, and Richard looked at her with a scary look. Uneasy and incomprehensible, I just had to wait for a smile on the back of the Dragon Master.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sorcerer and the corpse went back to the body<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know that as I spurt out the hot air, there is a faint smell of sulphur with a sulphur smell just like the smell of magma<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever Gotton lifted the sword and jumped into the army, the weekly general meeting filled the volcanic smell. In this fiery scent, Lina and other knights always Will be confident, no matter whether the front is a generation of strong or a thousand troops, they will take the initiative to break the sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s face with a head that is not fully condensed has a faint expectation that the little guy should bring more surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest wild "jing" spirit is also placed with his weapon a long bow and a short sword more than one meter five. When I pulled the bow and found that I didn’t use the bursting ability, I was completely dissatisfied. As long as the short sword was very rough, even the enchanting effect was not enough. Richard has already had a preliminary understanding of the forest hay’s fighting habits.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three talents completed the inspection of the corpse. After entering the military camp, after taking over the command, the first thing that Richard took was to bring together all the fighters who could participate in the battle and let them press The arms were lined up and then they were checked by the roster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of Richard quickly went even though the two thousand soldiers had "huā" for nearly two hours. I checked it again from beginning to end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niles and Aga "mén" farmers did not Looking at the two young people's patience is surprisingly good. Aga's "mén" farmer's sight is always from the beginning to the end of the body <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After an hour, Nellis couldn't help but whispered, "What exactly does Richard want to do? Is the biography of the military family much more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He is now exactly the same as at the beginning" Aga "mén" farmer suddenly said a sentence <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris immediately observed carefully and found out so much in each The time spent on a warrior is almost exactly the same but more important. The process of being dull and boring seems to have no effect on Richard. He has the same concentration and seriousness as the original, even if he has asked hundreds of questions. Never omit a word<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
