Next, it will enter the control and anti-control of the Master's battle classics, and the stage of magical confrontation. Coupled with the magical increase of the staff itself, the spell penetration, and the three attributes of the spell acceleration, the feather snake cane is also referred to as the supreme weapon of the Master's decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the equipment that Xiaomen Sa took out, he knew that the Mensa family had been planning this battle for a long time. The original magic of the small door Sa is higher than the two levels of Richard, coupled with incomparably luxurious equipment, in the eyes of the audience, this battle has no more suspense. Everyone knows that Archimonde lacks the foundation, and Gordon is almost a self-sufficient one, so the same as the reputation of the floating island giants, Archimonde is still the only giant with no legendary goods. Of course, when it comes to the latter, the word giant is always quoted. Moreover, Richard is unprepared, even if he wants to borrow, it is better to be able to get an epic gear in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa’s high-profile, epic-level equipment, especially the high-profile feather snake, is also hoping to put pressure and humiliation on Richard. The battle between the magicians is always full of changes, even if there is already a certain victory, Xiaomensa must also try to disturb Richard's state of mind and let him increase the chance of making mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just out of the duel at this time, just passing by Xiaomensa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small door of an epic ray of light suddenly came close to Richard, raised the staff in his hand, whispered: "See this feather snake stick "You are dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao stood still, looked up and down the feather snake stick, and said with a deep smile, said: "It's good. Something!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa’s face is serious, raising his voice and saying, “I am waiting for you inside!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he strode into the duel field, and the people who did not care about the duel were cleaning up the body of Fyodor. Richard smiled and knew that Xiaomensa was afraid of rest and restoring his magic, so he ended early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, Nyris looked angry and couldn’t help but say out loud: "It’s shameless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second emperor Nero smiled and seemed to have no idea of ​​his own. The three emperors looked at Nyris coldly, with a faint sneer, saying: "The king is defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris snorted, fundamentally Don't want to talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Philippe unexpectedly turned back and said: "You will always encounter such an opponent in the future, and there will never be less, think hard." I think how to deal with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three emperors nodded and focused on the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has become the focus of the audience. He went to Gangde, and Gangde took the lead and put down the magic box behind him and opened it to reveal the things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first took out a necklace, then lifted a faint brilliance of the staff, and finally picked up a long knife Back behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff in the hands of Richard is unique, and although it is far less gorgeous and radiant than the feather snake, the winged angel is even more impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who suddenly screamed: "Fate twins! Destiny Gemini!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duel The scene was immediately stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary staff of the destiny, is the staff used by Vatican before the permanent eternal dragon temple, following her name in the mainland travels head. The morning van Goghlin, also known as the two sides of the mirror, is because her treatment and disciplinary magic is equally fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same person recognized the long knife extinction on Richard’s back, but compared with the fate of the twins, this is the original treasure of the Xiong Peter’s family. It’s much more dim, and extinction and annihilation must be combined to be legendary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fate of Richard’s hands is only a fallen angel, half of the fate of the twins is much stronger than the feather snake. And the holy angel was originally unsuitable to the legal teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the duel, Xiaomen Sa only felt that his mouth was full of bitter taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really didn’t have a rest, even a bottle of magic recovery medicine did not drink, he only had a fateful twin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa clenched the feather snake stick, constantly reminding himself that the feather snake stick and the fate of the twins are not much different, and the two sides originally had two levels of The magic gap is that there is no feather snake stick, and the fate of the twins is barely making up for the magic gap between the two sides. Is it really like Richard said that he really has no courage to fight him fairly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Mensa suddenly found out that he was afraid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't know why he is afraid. As a result of repeated paper projections, as long as Richard dares to end, the rate of victory in this duel is as high as 90%. And there are half chances to beat Richard in the case of minor injuries. Now Richard has also experienced a duel and used up a whole eight fireballs. The situation is even better than the most optimistic ones expected. Why are you still afraid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s domineering crushing and killing Frodo is a shock to Xiaomensa. But how can you copy this tactic in him? Perhaps, he is only afraid of Richard's momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Mensa comforts himself so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard has entered the duel field and walked to the small gate, setting the limit of the distance of 30 meters to 50 meters agreed by the Master. Just 30 meters from the small gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, Philip looked at Richard’s pace and his eyes became sharper and sharper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa’s eyes fell on the long knife behind Richard, trying to make a relaxed look and sarcasm: “I have never been in any Master’s showdown. I saw that there is a knife to play. Can you tell me, what are you going to do with this knife?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Richard is still beautiful, but reveals one The cruel taste of the stock, said: "I will tell you when the duel is over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the two adjacent boxes in the stands, the Duke of Mensa turned his head Smiling at the Duke of Peter Peter next door, "The knife that Richard is carrying is the extinction of your family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old bear Peter snorted and said, "It’s all that Sinclair’s waste is useless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa said easily: "Nothing, a moment This knife will return to the original owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the gate in the duel field has been closed, and the great magister who served as the referee has already retreated to the edge of the field. Just wait for the return to the side of the field, it will signal the beginning of the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Richard’s face has disappeared, and the whole person exudes an unfamiliar momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-spirited Philip suddenly sighed and pointed his finger at Richard’s finger, and said: "This man may be more than a song." Don’t go further!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Nyris was taken aback, but I didn’t expect Philip’s evaluation of Richard to be so high! However, until now, he was not very optimistic about Richard’s performance in the decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician raised his hand to the sky, a golden red fireball fluttered straight into the sky, the decisive battle began! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa immediately waved the feather snake stick, and instantly gave himself one-on-one air shield, acceleration and magic shield. He is still unfinished, and he has added a magical state magic to himself. Xiaomensa's series of actions are dazzling, and in just a few seconds, a protective action that an ordinary magician takes half a minute to complete is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard is only holding up the fate of the twins, sings the spell with concentration, and with his spell, the fate of the fallen angel on the black wing begins to flash. Many people who have been involved in magic have heard that Richard sang six levels of magical lightning, but they all judged that a six-level magic is simply not enough to knock down all the magical protection, and there is an epic equipment. . When he started to attack with full force, he was guilty of making a magical matchup. As long as the small door slammed the attack, his counterattack was fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the blood on the face of Richard is rapidly fading, and the electric light that entangles in the fate of the twins carries a glare of blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has raised his destiny and gently waved forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden appearance of a bloody electric light as a bucket in the sky, falling from the sky, silently hitting the top of the small door...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times of the moment is as incomparably slow, under the circumstance of bloody electric light, the magical defense of Xiaomensa’s body instantly becomes nothing, and the electric light immediately slams down, he The face turned from white to red, then from red to burnt black. Subsequently, a group of blazing fireballs suddenly smashed out from the small door Sa, and the flames flickered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happens when the mind is too late to work.喀啦! The sly voice was then passed to the audience's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, all the people in the duel who have certain accomplishments in magic all stood up and screamed! There is still a bloody electric light in their pupils, which reminisces the taste of life and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be such a powerful lightning? The bloody electric light has exceeded their knowledge of magic. It is the ultimate destruction. In the six levels of magic, there is a power beyond the eight. But that was the vitality of the end of destruction, because they smelled a thick life from the bloody lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
