			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, all Archimonde's zì yóu warriors and step knights They were summoned and assembled on the cāo field. There are more than 300 people who can be selected by Richard. As usual, Richard walks in front of everyone and asks them about their skills, family and specialties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process lasted for more than an hour. The spectator of Faschi, like the original Nyris and Agamemnon, was also incompetent for Richard. Lundi was shocked by patience and meticulousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard finally picked out twenty-six people, including seventeen zì yóu fighters. Their common feature is that they have the four configurations necessary for the knights, but they are not the most talented people, and the carrying capacity can only be qualified. Half of the people in the game are limited to fifteen levels. Even if they reach the end and get the best results, they will only become the knights of the sharp construction, with the power to close to the ordinary naked sanctuary of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for an army, this is the most suitable backbone. If the power is stronger, close to or even reach the sanctuary, they will become difficult to command, such as the thirteen knights of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard asked the old butler to remove the spare armor weapons from the family warehouse and equip everyone with complete equipment. There is still a day to return to Faro. If the craftsmen on the floating island work overtime, they will have time to modify the unsuitable places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Gordon’s study, he finally disposed of what should be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a piece of magic paper and carefully wrote down the things and people to go to Faro on the line above to make a final confirmation. Seeing the supplies on this list, Richard already knows roughly how much he will earn when he returns to Faro. This is entirely profiteering, and it is even faster than the profit he made for the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of a set of wild barriers is less than 200,000 gold coins, but the overall effect is stronger than the ordinary second-order knights, so the official price is also about In a million or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement, the royal family will provide Richard with about five sets of materials, that is, nearly one million gold coins in exchange for a set of wild barriers. Therefore, the success rate of the builders determines the profit margin. In the case of materials other than the agreed-upon, the Royal will be recovered at a slightly lower market price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high success rate of Richard can guarantee the cost of a set of less than 200,000. On the surface, the Royal Builder's income seems to be less than directly auctioning the structure. However, the real benefits of this position are identity, privilege, status, and countless rare materials that are not available at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, in the hands of Richard, even if it is for the royal family, it can make crazy profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Richard is eager to return to Noland is because the trans-planet trade is the source of real profits. Only with the support of such huge profits, his strength and power can expand as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the revenue is always positive or negative. In addition to many gains in this return, Richard also harvested an enemy who was also a royal builder, Luno. In the more than a decade of his role as a royal builder, Luno has accumulated a great deal of wealth, supporting his research, his students and the forces gathered around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some forces can use interests to differentiate or draw together, the long-standing entanglement is not only dependent on the gold coins, it takes a lot of time, and the most lacking time for Richard is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many things to do, but the time of alternating seven sè is constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Richard’s biggest advantage is that he is now earning profits several times or even ten times faster than Lunault’s, when wealth and power are accumulated. There is no need to worry about Luno or anyone else. Not only does Richard's success rate be much higher than that of Luno, but the high success rate also means a significant reduction in the time required to draw the assembly. According to the information provided by Nyris, Richard estimates that he is drawing half of the second-order structure roughly half or less of Luno's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency is also the source of profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is immersed in calculating the proceeds of the plane’s journey and extrapolating the amount of power that can be translated into it, and how much should be retained to earn more. Getting the most out of a particular point in time is a complex issue, especially if you need to consider so many factors, even with Richard's ability, the calculation time needs to be measured in hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time in the old butler's office, Coco stood up in uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is wearing a gold-rimmed pair of glasses, and is carefully reading a piece of paper full of dense numbers. After a while, he finished the last line, then wrote a number on it with an ink pen and handed the paper to cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa took it, only took a look at it, you know it is your family's recent income and expenditure details and some important events. The number written by the old butler is the family’s financial deficit in the most recent quarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the big event, Sensi Archimonde, the same brother of Coco, does not currently hold any position in the Archimonde family. Always living in the knight's collar. Two months ago, he tried to grab the daughter of a local civilian farmer and eventually succeeded, and in the process, the parents of the girl were seriously injured. The case is being heard in the local aristocratic circuit court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pier Archimonde, the father of Coco. With a small territory, the income is meager, even if the salary of the vice captain of the Black Rose Castle Guard is far from enough to support the kind of luxury life he has now, the loss figure is that the three knights can not make up the income. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peel Knight did not go bankrupt because of the huge deficit, and can maintain a luxurious life, the reason is that one from the Akmon family, the exact point is from the song Subsidy. The grant has been paid for a year, several times the income of the Peel Knight. Recently, the quota has been raised once more, and a quarterly payment has been made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grant comes from the cocoa being sent to Faust and entering the companion list. Originally her qualifications were very stubborn, but because of the stable service of the Peel Knight for a long time, she was given some care. After all, the unruly Archimonde is rarely willing to do a position that is not similar to the gatekeeper for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion was originally an obligation for every Archimonde woman, but traditionally only for women who are truly rich in Akmon. With Gordon successfully entering the floating island and gaining a foothold in the private plane, and began to have a stable income, he began to increase the subsidy for his partner and cultivate a large number of stepping knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gordon, the soldiers on the floating island, as well as all women with partners, can receive a quarterly subsidy. The amount of this money may not be a thing for a baron, but it is not a small income for most knights. For Archimonde, who was originally a civilian, this is a huge sum that can completely change the state of family life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
