Windy wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleist broke the boat, used the life-saving close to the legendary burst skills, and went against the wind, finally succeeded in approaching the ventral side of the mother nest, here should be A blind spot for many insects. However, he saw that the pleats on the ventral side of the mother's nest suddenly opened, protruding a row of nozzle-like organs, and then a large piece of pale green liquid sprayed onto him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleist made an earth-shattering scream, like the smooth melting of the smoothie in the sun, the body surface is quickly dissolved, only one of his inner armor The pistol in the hand remains intact in the solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest suddenly turned into a flexible turn in the air, bite Kleist bite, and then swallowed a few mouthfuls. Although its head was blasted, the wound broke open and became a huge mouthpart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snoring of the mother's nest quickly overwhelmed the rest of the battlefield, and the huge body fell into the air and broke into the Noland Warriors. Central formation. Countless weapons hit the mother's nest in the first place, but they were bounced back like they were on the mountain. Only a few generals' weapons can leave some traces on the shiny insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has suddenly breathed a sigh of relief...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All perceptive keen And the veterans who rolled over many times between life and death have subconsciously stepped back. The mother's nest at this time gave them a strong sense of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest spurted in one breath, and suddenly there were numerous cracks on both sides of the body. A short and thick squirting organ stretched out from under the chest and in the folds. Out. Then there was a loud sound like a thunderous bang, a group of gray-green liquid blasted like a cannonball, bombarded around the soldiers, a Norland warrior was directly blasted, only strong officers can put their feet Nail into the ground. However, they discovered that the nightmare is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the gray-green liquids quickly evaporate in the air, turning into dense fog of large groups, gradually spreading around. There is strong corrosion and highly toxic properties in the dense fog, and almost no one can stand. And those soldiers who were directly sprayed by the venom, even the armor will be instantly eroded, and the flesh and blood below will continue to emit green smoke and quickly melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the mother's nest created a blank area in the center of Noland's formation, and Raymond could no longer successfully command the soldiers under his command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked into the distance, where hundreds of feather snakes were desperately trying to hit a big magician, so that he could not make it out, hurricane and Lightning continued to flash in a small space, constantly blasting on the magic shield of the Magister's mentor. From time to time, the light and the land were bizarre, but full of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the big magician around Raymond on the one hand to protect Raymond, on the other hand, to constantly resist the mental impact of the mother's nest, it seems embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest awkwardly moved a few times in the battle, after adjusting the direction, it rushed to Raymond's foothold. It spouts out the acid that the Sanctuary does not dare to contaminate, and where it rushes, there will be a large toxic mist, and even where the hen’s nest passes, the poisonous mist will remain for a long time, which makes it impossible. Stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is finally relieved that the biggest weakness of the Brood is the fear of the Magister. Magic power is more likely to break its armor than physical power. As long as there are more than three magic mentors teamed up, the huge female nest can't be dodged, and it will inevitably be hit hard. After the insects were blasted, the ordinary strong also had the ability to kill the mother's nest. This is why Richard did not dare to let the mother's nest play at the beginning of the war. Now that the big magician of the Raymond side is divided, the mother's nest becomes the reaper of the ordinary warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is tilted to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha mobilizes the final magic, so that his voice can resound through the battlefield again: "Raymond, you crazy! You want all the soldiers of Noland Are you buried for your ambition and madness? Surrender! You are struggling again, and it is still the end of the army! I have thirty-six riders in my hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the minds of the Nolanders, the deterrent of the knights is much larger than the mother's nest, because they do not understand what the mother's nest is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond couldn’t easily avoid the acid that fell down on his head, and fell heavily on the ground, all with plasma mud. The big magician flew down from the air, and picked up Raymond. However, the mother's nest was shot by an acid. The big magician had a mental shock at this moment. With Raymond escaped from the acid range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, under the continuous pursuit of the mother's nest, Raymond has been unable to command the army at all, so that the overall battlefield situation has been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the shouts of Richard, Raymond had a strong color on his face, ready to fight in the end, but suddenly looked up, but suddenly stopped. The great magister who had just pushed him out, the face is no longer calm and firm, but a hint of fear, embarrassment and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When faced with the Faroese indigenous, all Norland fighters were able to die, because they knew that they were not killed or killed after being captured. There is no kindness in the plane war. For the indigenous people, the intruder is a heresy, that is, the devil spokesperson, and it is going to be on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is not an indigenous person of Faro, he is a Norand, or a giant leader of Faustian, and he has a plane leading to Noland. Portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the current lack of high-end powers under Richard’s hands, regardless of the Sanctuary or the Magister, as long as they can prove their loyalty, I’m sure that Richard will not only Retained, and will be reused. With hope for life, who is willing to fight blood? After all, this is the war between Joseph and Archimonde, the war between Richard and Raymond, the war of family warriors connected to the family blood, the wars of family members who are related to the rise and fall of the family, but not They are wars of being employed by the family or just being employed by the strong of this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an angry and painful call from not far away. The gray-haired old man leaped into the sky and hung a long line of blood behind him. . But he didn't jump too much, and he fell to the ground again, obviously hurting very much. As soon as he landed, he was surrounded by groups of knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in gray clothing got rid of the Duke of Glasgow and the Duke of the Wolf in the most critical moment, and rushed into the battlefield to stop and go, like going in and out. The unmanned Archimonde of the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the quality of the candidate knights provided by Agamemnon is extremely high, no worse than the knights who have already experienced battles. I am not afraid of death. The ability to suit the wild barriers can often save their lives at critical times. Gray-haired veterans often have four or five swords to kill a knight, but during this time, he himself has to add one or two wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the gray-haired old man screamed unwillingly, and was smashed by a warrior with a knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he fell in the dust, he was unable to stand up, the body strength was relaxed, and the wounds in the body could no longer be gathered and began to surge. Blood. The old man gasped like a fish that was thrown ashore. At this moment, the mud in his side suddenly jumped out of the figure and threw himself on him, and a filthy blade pierced the old man's heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted and waved his elbows, hitting the attacker's waist ribs. But the feeling at the elbow is extremely weird, and it is not like hitting someone. At this moment, a strong suction suddenly appeared from his heart, and the essence of his life was constantly sucked away. There are a few vague voices in the throat of the old man, and they will not move any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man who once killed the three gods of the god of war and the blood of the gods in the body to escape from the wild is the first of Raymond’s Strong. At this moment, he died in an enemy who could not figure out what race it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a constant flow of force from the blade to the body, and the twilight suddenly shakes all over the body, his face is strange, then he looks up to the sky and makes a sound from the depths of his throat. Is it an extreme joy or a cry of pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the old man in gray is almost at the same time known to many powerful players on the battlefield. The Faro side is naturally a morale, but the Norland side is grayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond’s vision flashed a pale golden light, which is the brilliance of the magic, but it seems so familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magician around him recognized the source of the brilliance of the divine power, and said with a smile: "Rimon, how did you see it? It is eternal." The priest of the Dragon Temple is casting magic. Richard has been completely rooted in Faro, and he even dared to let the eternal and timeless dragons openly fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the last straw that overwhelmed the camel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond has gathered the greatest strength, exhausted political wisdom, mobilized the power of all allies, and sent the army to Faro at great cost. surface. However, Richard’s hidden strength far exceeds his imagination, from the siege of the portal, and the unexpectedly distant departure of the transmission site, to thirty-five knights, hundreds of dangerous feather snakes, equipped The humanoid knights with the fighting spirit and strength are above the elite of Noland, and the last is the mother's nest of a huge war behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this plane, how many secrets did Richard hide? How did he let the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple fight side by side with the gods of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder suddenly felt tired, very tired, he slowly closed his eyes and said tiredly: "We lost. It is time to end the war." Richard is right, can't let these loyal warriors shed the last drop of blood for me. I believe that Richard will give the surrendered soldiers a chance to survive. Master, help me the last time, I need my voice as a warrior. We heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s magical light flashed, his voice resounded to the battlefield for the last time: “The heroic Noland warriors, you have proved your courage and Dignity. Now, it is no longer necessary to continue fighting. Your commander, Raymond Joseph, will give you the final order. I command you to lay down your arms and surrender to Richard Archimonde."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This command spreads with the sound in all directions, and many of the soldiers who are still in the fight are quietly slowing down the movements of the hands, and then, one after another Noland warriors In the hesitation, he stopped the killing and slowly put down the weapons in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magister also exhausted the magic, he held the weak Raymond, standing quietly in the middle of the battlefield. Around them, there was not even a Noland warrior who could stand. The huge mother nest stopped at more than ten meters and looked at them with contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
