			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of cleaning up the battlefield is very heavy, and the knights in the battle have put a corpse Dragged outside the base and unloaded the equipment on the corpse. Richard began to warn the warriors of the prisoners. The content of his questions was very detailed, from geography to religion to customs, and even the baron’s character would be involved. Every time the review is made, Richard will record the information on a few pages of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the base is cleared, it is close to dusk. Hundreds of corpses were piled up in the open space outside the base, and the aroma of food began to flow in the forward base. The sand has woke up from meditation, but when she walked into the pub, she saw that Richard was still interrogating a soldier, and a thick stack of records had been placed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard is full of tiredness, his eyes are still clear, and the records on paper are neat and beautiful, and there is no such thing as scribble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand sand sat next to Richard and said seriously: "You should rest, the magician without magic is not as good as the warrior."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the sky and said, "There are two last people. When I ask, I will go eat." He patted the thick record next to him and said, "These information. It's more important than my magic. We know almost nothing about this plane, and we don't know what it is waiting for us tomorrow. I need to figure out a clue as soon as possible to decide what to do next. We will destroy this battle. More than one-third of the elite of the Baron Fossa, especially the five fighting jazz, died three. In a short time, I believe he did not dare to attack again, the remaining strength, now only enough for him to defend himself The core territory. So I have to restore the magic, and it is time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Li sighed and said: "Just just now, I realized that I made a big mistake. I should chase it immediately at the end of the battle. The deserters, and took the temper to take down the town of Osfa at the foot of the mountain. There are horses left by the knights, at least dozens of superior horses! This is a great fortune and an increase in our strength. But now, those deserters are sure Already returned to Osfa and took away all the horses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee, you can't make no mistakes. In fact, you are here. The performance in the battle can be called the best general. Don't be too demanding, you are less than sixteen years old." Although the sand is still faint, but the tone is very gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at his head and said with a smile: "This is a completely strange plane, facing a powerful enemy that has never been seen before, and The god of this plane also lowered the gods, detailing the position where we appeared. And what about us? Even if we don’t even know how to come here, now there is nothing but a little basic material. The original advance team members They all disappeared in the torrent of time, and the elite warriors died three in the first attack. And now they don’t know whether they can domesticate the locals to fight for us. There is no room for making mistakes!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand hand is placed on Richard's hand, slowly and gently said: "Calm, Richard. You can't squeeze yourself like this, you are the leader of all of us, this is not to say But the fact that you have the most powerful lethality and the builder, and don't forget that you also have the god of eternal and time dragons. My mother and my nest appear here, which is the proof of the gods. As for the god of courage, I think it only Predicting the position of the portal when we enter the plane, the abnormal fluctuations of the space are traceable, and it is impossible to know our future movements. If the god is strong enough, then the waiting for us is not a high jazz. Finally, Richard, if you have something wrong, everyone who has a contract with you can't live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This responsibility seems to be a bit too big." Li sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is looking at his eyes seriously and says, "This is your choice, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and smiled and finally returned to his face and said, "I know what to do. The magic material I brought this time is enough for four structures. Later, I Add a decoration to you. The magic increase, according to the existing materials on hand, only this structure is suitable for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. But I will first To deal with those bodies, you should call me two knights and ten captives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ire promised, called two step knights Then, I ordered the names of the ten captives and asked them to follow the sand to deal with the body. Most of the prisoners have been examined, and Richard’s powerful memory has kept all of their information in mind. The prisoners are ordinary warriors, and the injuries are lighter. Most importantly, the attitude is relatively docile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just arranged everything, Gangde strode in and shouted: "Head! Open the meal, fill the stomach and say it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also smelled a thick food scent and immediately felt very hungry. However, he still tried the final prisoners before he followed Gangde to a small building that was temporarily converted into a restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first floor hall, there is a scent everywhere, and three free riders, water splashes and Oral are sitting around the table, one person A large bowl in front of him is eating and gorging. As soon as he entered the hall, Richard saw that the ogre tiramisu was actually in the kitchen and forced something in a cauldron. It seems that the food that everyone eats is actually cooked by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde also gave Richard a big bowl and smiled and said: "Hey, you two ogres have a good kitchen. Art, a pot of meat is cooked to be much better than the things in the training camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral snorted and said: "The meat is only I used to eat a lot. But this time it’s really good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral once turned around in several big nobles, naturally trying There are countless foods. Even he feels good, that is naturally good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ogre who was busy in the kitchen roared to Gangde: "Small man! I have a name, don't always be a ogres." The ogre called me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Ok, my fault!" Gangde raised his hands and said, "I am willing to ask for mercy:" I know that you are called a three-pointer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a three-pointed angry voice coming out of the door: "I am a three-pointer, and he is called Tiramisu! Little man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed and boring into the restaurant, staring angrily at Gangde, there is something to be done. Richard had to stand up and stop the ogre and said, "Okay! Gangde is not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Ben wanted to say that Gangde was not interested However, when I looked back, I saw that the face of Gangde’s thief was clearly deliberate. At first it was that Richard did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde saw it and laughed a few times and said, "Okay, I admit that I was deliberate. I will call your name in the future, but you I can't call me a little one again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
