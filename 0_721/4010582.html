			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tree of life stops again, Richard gets up and pulls Opened the door of the tree house, this is the first time he got out of bed after he was injured, but his pale face still reveals his injury. As soon as the door is opened, there is a short knife stabbing in. It was a guardian elf hunter. He wanted to rush into the tree house, but he didn't expect the door to open suddenly, but he reacted very quickly. No matter how much, he stabbed it in first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has taken a step forward and has already left the tree house from the hunter’s side, while his right hand flicks, taking a piece of film and pulling it out from the back of the hunter. A long arrow, backhand inserted into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter's body fell from the tree of life, and Richard looked around, but saw that the tree of life was already on the battlefield, and from time to time someone screamed and fell into the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original war has already burned to the tree of life, and Richard thought, picking up a cold arrow that was shot, and inserted it into a slang hunter. The heart, then pushed him down the tree. During this time, all of Richard’s thoughts were fighting the gray gas left in the body. The strength of the laws contained in these gray gases was above the initial expectations of Richard. It was the last point of residual gray gas, but it could not be eradicated. The injury was difficult to recover. I didn't expect to be disturbed this day. The original situation has been in danger to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in the tree of life, and the team was handed over to help him. His speed was not fast, and there was not much power in his hand. However, he just swayed a thorn, and the slang of the proverbs could not be evaded at all, and they could only watch their own evils run through the sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of a guardian elf falls from the tree of life, and there are still guardian elves in the forest, and the knights are not far from the tree of life. Divided into several teams, and is being smashed with a group of tree people. There is an extraordinarily tall war tree in the war tree. The tree is full of wounds everywhere, but it is still imposing. Every whip is made, it will make the knights How many scars are added, this ancient war tree is close to the legendary level. Under the protection of the forest will, the real strength has crossed the threshold of the legend, so that the 50-member knights do not fall, the war is old and difficult. The point is that every time a group of tree people will be activated, although the activation tree is not strong, but the number is large, the war tree can call out about ten activated tree people every time, and ordinary The war tree people have only two trees at a time, and the interval is much longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li looked at the ancient tree of war, he knew that he would put this guy down. I am afraid that at least three or five knights must be built. He then looked into the distance and could feel the gathering in that direction. A lot of strong atmosphere, although invisible, Richard knows that if you look down at the high altitude of the forest, you will be able to see a large forest of walking, which is a terrorist army composed of war trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden slamming in the distance, and Richard immediately felt the breath of the tree of life under his feet as a tremor, and Li looked at him and immediately saw a guardian elf. With a tomahawk, I was cutting the tree of life at a glance. Just a click, it was a small branch that was cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart sank slightly, speeding up to the guardian elf, grabbing a short knife of a guardian elf on the road, stabbing him Then throw it back, the short knife is like a fish, swims silently for dozens of meters, and then falls into the back of the guardian elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a hunter staring at Richard, but a hunter rushed up, but they all turned into corpses and fell down the tree of life. They saw that Richard was weak. Powerless, there is no tyrannical atmosphere, so it is rushed one by one. I thought that I could solve Richard once, but I didn’t expect Richard to just solve an hunter with an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movements of Richard are extremely simple, and they will bring up the afterimages of the film, but these extremely simple attacks are unstoppable, one by one. Can see that his key is broken, but Richard can not kill faster, but also has no ability to cast high-level magic, the magic that he can use at this moment is very small, full of magical armed forces to provide explosive power, to be called The horrible fighting art kills the enemy, and now Richard can't even make everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tsunami-like roar in the distance. The ancient tree of war suffered numerous wounds and finally fell down. The ancient trees of war fell down. Planting trees is just a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of tweet in the depths of the forest. The guardian elves received the signal and retreated like a tide. The tree of life started again. Richard did not return to the tree house to recover. Instead, wrinkling his eyebrows and looking back and forth at the wound of the tree of life. The guardian elves not only attacked the tree of life, but also attacked the body of the tree of life. After a lap, Richard saw at least hundreds of wounds. In the case of the tree of life, these are only minor injuries, but there are a lot of accumulations. This attack has hundreds of wounds. The next attack can be hundreds, and next time it may be thousands, not many times will be life. The tree causes irreversible damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest camps in the distance are still chasing. In recent waves, there have not been many big Druids and Sanctuary hunters. They are both careful and not close to the formation of the knights. The guardian elves are well aware of With the knight's power, the Cavaliers can kill the Sanctuary level opponents once they are volleyed. Now the Tree of Life has enough power to resist the forest will, and it will turn around as the home of the Eternal Night Elf and the Construction Knight, but when time If you grow longer, the consumption caused by migration will accumulate to a certain extent, and the damage you receive will increase. The scope of life tree will be smaller and smaller. When the tree of life cannot resist the will of the forest, proverbs like elders The important person will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice leaped to the tree of life at this time, and quickly came to Richard, the short hair of the female god of war was even more red, because it was covered with Blood, at the crucial moment of the battle, she also had to rush to the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Ellie looked at each other and saw the worries in her eyes, and lowered the voice and said, "Now let the guardian elves attack the life." Tree, I am afraid there is no way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't contact the base city to support it?" Ellie asked with the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "If we can walk alive within 300 kilometers of the base city, there will be hope."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked dark and immediately returned to normal, said coldly: "There is nothing to lose a tree of life. There is now seven Alliance tribes on the proverb side, that is It’s said that there are eight trees of life, plus a tree of the world, it’s ours sooner or later, but if it’s not Melin’s, we’re safe now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp In the last sentence, Ellie is almost squeezed out of her teeth. Ellie has been leading for a long time. Soon after the migration, after a few trips with the chasing guardian elves, she I know that if you leave for a few days, there will be not so many things. Even if Richard does not negotiate with the proverbs, he will not worry about the feelings of the Eternal Elfs. If you push the village directly to the road, there will be more hope. Now she knows how hard it is to get the majority of the time, and if it’s not Mei Lin’s sneak attack Inspect, Richard can go back to the base city alone, call the army and followers to meet the tree of the night, and under the full pressure of the will of the forest, only Richard can distinguish the direction in the forest, which is not much different from the specific strength. Relationship, but the mastery of the rules of the plane, such as the current strength of Tiramisu may not be under Richard, but the ogre almost no knowledge of the rules of the Greenson plane, as lost in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Melin's knife is equivalent to smashing a tree of life, plus many life of the knight, so Ellie simply hated her the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can understand her thoughts and reach out and pat her shoulders and say, "This is over, don't worry, I still think, The person who hurts me is not her, but another person, but now, you need to consider the emergency plan. Once we are caught up by the forest camp, we may have to give up the tree of life, have my holy unicorn, should Can support near the base city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice nodded and said, "I know what to do." After that, she jumped down the tree of life. The regrouping of the knights has gone. Just after a big battle, there are five costume knights killed, four of them died under the ancient trees of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Ellie, what Richard wanted to say, but held back, just sighed, he understood what Ellie wanted to do, The limited scope of the sacred unicorn can be protected. Even if you try your best, you can only help a few hundred people to resist the will of the forest. The magical rider of the knight is huge, so that fewer people can be brought. Half of the elves in the entire Yongyue tribe can't take it away. With Ellie's character, all the knights will definitely be taken away, and then look at the gap to be able to hold a few night elves. Who can leave in the Yongye tribe, and Ellie is not going to manage it. She wants the Yongye tribe to kill a bloody river in order to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the tree house and sat on the bed, but could not enter the state of meditation. He began to recall what he had done to the Yongye tribe, among them. There are many errors that can be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is my heart too soft." Richard could not help thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life is struggling, it is getting closer and closer to the forward base, and the speed is getting slower and slower. Later, standing under the tree of life can I feel that the earth is shaking slightly. This tremor is not from the tree of life, but from afar. There are a large number of war trees in the place that are coming at full speed. Every night elf becomes silent. They know the forest camp. The horror, and now it is near to the shock that can be felt when the ancient trees of war are marching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction is within reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the endless battle has become the best anesthetic, so that people can not think about the fate of coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
