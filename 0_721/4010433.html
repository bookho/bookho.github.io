			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is absolutely soulful, but that is characteristic of it Exaggerated words, there is a structure that will really produce its own soul. Some of the fifth-order structures are actually called souls, but those who seal the powerful souls in the structure, or in the structure Adding enough divinity to produce a soul-like effect is completely different from life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know, the true soul, that is the realm of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in front of this life is utterly stunned, stunned, bloody like a wave, as if roaring, it seems like taking the soul of Richard to take off It seems to have a feeling of resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked closely at the floating blood, and wanted to reach out to get the costume, but found that he was hesitant at this moment, and even a little afraid The layers of blood and light are surging, thick and solid, and the depths are hidden to the door of another world, constantly passing from the darkness or strong, or concealed trombone roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin sweat began to ooze from Richard’s forehead, and his firm will and wisdom talent told him that it was not produced after the murder was too rich. Illusion, he does not understand how this life will become like this, which is not explained by any magic theory he has learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forced himself to calm down and play back the whole process of making this life in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of life is getting more and more intense, and the roaring sound has gradually become clear from vagueness. Such obvious changes have forced Richard to speed up. The process of recall and analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was nervously recalling, the demon lying in the corner suddenly snorted, woke up, struggling to climb, now at Li Inspecting the instinct, it is not a threat, but it is absolutely troublesome, it will interfere with the process of recall analysis, so Richard kicked a box of magic, just on the head of the devil, and smashed it. I fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scene of lightning is replayed in the consciousness of Richard, suddenly fixed on a picture, this is the return of Richard Chass, the pen to draw In the last process, when he raised the magic pen, a few drops of blood splashed on the tip of the pen, mixed with the magic dye, and at that time, Richard’s chest was boiling, not paying attention to this small Oh, so there is a perfection of this momentum, but the material has brought in the seal of impurities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life has never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trajectories of the drops of blood were also clearly traced back, and it was Richard’s own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard slowly extended to life, but the heart was repeatedly fighting. The effect of this life was amazing and powerful, so strong that he could not Abandoning, but the structure has obviously changed. Under his analysis, he discovered several new abilities that cannot be known at all. For example, the obvious world-like atmosphere in the depths of the blood, it is so powerful that Richard is scared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil climbed up again at this time, it will not choose an appropriate time to wake up, Richard has no mood at this time and it wastes time, just 跺The lower foot, let the room tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cry, a metal can at the top of the wall shelf swayed and fell, and Dangdang right on the head of the demon, once again It fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard finally puts his life on the shackles. Only in this way, his analytical ability can better analyze the structure of this structure. What kind of variation has occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the whole four lives of Richard’s arms were suddenly all lit up, and each of them overflowed with a blood line, which was associated with that life. The changed life immediately violently burned, and instantly turned into two groups of blood, not into the arms of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked. He didn’t expect that just a simple touch action inspired the structure and actually loaded himself onto himself. He continuously checked his body inside. In the case, I found that there was no abnormality, which only slightly lowered my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s strange that Richard didn’t find a new life. He’s still four superimposed lives on his forearm, and there’s no fifth. Traces, but the four lives have produced some changes, no longer as sharp as before, but become a bit deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you compare the original life to a sharp dagger, then the new life is a heavy machete, but the blade is in the blood There are more rust spots under the dip, although the sharpness is not as good as before, but it makes people look more chilling, and the power of the chopper is more than the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s heart moved slowly, driving his life to death. His physical strength was absorbed by life faster than he was. Then Richard saw that his fingertips had become bright red, with life. The driving force of the cockroach, the bright red on the fingertips quickly spread to the palm of the hand. At this moment, the hand of Richard is just like the one that has just been fished out of the blood, and the red color continues to spread, and the wrists begin to be divided into numerous complicated and complicated. The pattern, all the way up, until it extends to Richard's upper arm, this stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has put his hands in front of his eyes. For a moment, he couldn’t believe that this is his own hand. These hands are long and stable, and now they are more glamorous and magnificent. There was a faint red light on his fingertips, and there was always an impulse to tear something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly reached out and reached the workbench. The workbench made of hard oak was easily penetrated like a cheese, and then the place where the hole was worn was It began to break and decay, turned into gray-black sawdust, sprinkled a pile on the ground, and the hole continued to expand. In the blink of an eye, the entire workbench disappeared in front of Richard and became a pile of burning things. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the effect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at his hand in a blank way, and for a moment he couldn’t believe that the insertion would cause such terrible damage, but the truth is that the pile on the ground Yu Yu and a variety of materials scattered in the ground reminded Richard that everything that just happened was not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a rush of footsteps outside the courtyard. Several people went straight to the courtyard of Richard. They stopped at the gate of the courtyard, although the courtyard wall It has collapsed everywhere. The so-called half-frame of the courtyard door has long been in vain, but these people are not willing to take a step and show great respect for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "General Richard, what kind of body do you have to deal with today?" The headed person called out outside the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every day, they will take away one or two of the bodies of the Dakso Das strong from Richard, because the place where Richard lives is from the gate. It’s too close, over the wall, across a block of Richard’s small courtyard, and now almost uninhabited in the city’s defense zone, there are only white nights, Richard and two other madmen, Richard’s courtyard and white nights. Lawrence is close to the target, so the goal is very obvious, so there will always be Daq Sodas people who rush into the city. Of course, so far, the visit has become a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is busy with the construction, naturally, there is no need to do small things like collecting materials, so the killing Dax Sodas strong will be handed over to the marshal, and the materials collected will naturally be clear. Deduct the one that should be handed in, and the rest will be converted into gold coins, magic materials or sacrifices, and will be recorded on the account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took back his hands, fixed his mind, responded with a sigh, and then walked around the house, Dakso Das, who came to visit today. He was so extravagant that he found four bodies and threw them out of the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside people rang a sigh of condolences. I didn’t expect that one day’s effort would kill four Dakso Das people, presumably already At the peak, however, another person immediately replied with a louder voice. He saw the feat of Richard and the white night out of the fortress and the robbing of the comrades' body from the teeth of the Daksodars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all right?" The strong leader, as usual, asked, this is a guest sentence, but Richard suddenly stunned and turned to look at the house. Corner, where there is still a living thing lying down, the devil does not know when he has woke up, is curling up in the corner, watching Richard with desperate eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the absolute battlefield for more than a year, the demon who died in the hands of Richard has at least two digits. He sees that this is a possibility that he is not yet fully adult. The devil, with a pair of red, but quite clear eyes, although his expression is fierce, but the depths of the pupil are all frightened and desperate, not the same as other Dax Sodas, the more injured, the more It is a fierce fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of Richard, an idea suddenly emerged. Is it true that the Dakosodas have been unable to support them, even those who have not yet grown up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's Master, is that all right?" The outside person repeated it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, Richard replied: "No, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, we will come back this time tomorrow. If you have any needs, please let me know." The strong man said with respect, he greeted his men and went down the next block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Permanent glory' is always running, the burning fireball sprinkles light into every corner that can be illuminated, and makes the day and night become real In fact, even the original day and night changes that were not obvious disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
