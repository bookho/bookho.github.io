			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to the ransacked town of Jovan, Osfa Obviously much more fortunate, this town, which is closest to the mountains and intruder bases, has never been visited. The focus of the two traffic movements in the town of Jovan is different. The main income of Richard is from the manor of the High Jazz and the Knights Camp. The tax collected from the town is only meaning. The income of the Baron army is all from Jovan, so now the people in the town have some unclear who hate more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the meaning of Richard to bypass Osfa. He thought carefully, and repeatedly played the map repeatedly, before deciding to let go of this most threatening supply point, and then directly into the heart of the town of Jovan, it was successful, and initially reached a number of Strategic objectives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another point of view, the immovable Osfa may also give the enemy an illusion that they have already left the forward base and choose another nest. nest. Otherwise, there is no reason not to pull out the nail in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the night, Richard led the troops around a big circle and marched toward the mountains. When the day is bright, they will reach the edge of the mountain. There is only one village on this route, and it is easy to hide whereabouts. Needless to say, the lead-in fighters who are familiar with the terrain are the ones who lead the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dawn arrived, the team had left the town of Jovan for 30 kilometers and crossed a sparse forest to the small lake next to the foothills. . The team will take a break here and open up a temporary camp. As for the next step, there is only one prototype in Richard's mind. There is no complete plan and I need to wait for the news of Marvin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lake is small, the water is very clear, and the calm lake is like a mirror made of sapphire. Several mountain streams converge in the river not far away, and eventually they are injected into the lake. The lakeside is a grassy meadow, and the horses have untied the reins, and the experienced soldiers graze with drinking water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two carriages are also parked by the lake. This is the last place where the carriage can reach. It is a steep mountain and it is difficult to pass even the horse. . When the women and children who had bumped for one night came down from the carriage, they were pale and uneasy, and they almost stood still. Some of the young ladies, who were somewhat beautiful, fainted at any time, but when they found out that they were helping two horrible ogres, they immediately screamed and became more spiritual than anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a powerful and rapidly cultivating intellectual race, the ogre also exists in this plane, and because of the high-profile recipe, it belongs to One of the monsters that are familiar to both men and women. After a period of confusion and screaming, the captive women and children were rushed together, and they sat down safely, waiting for the soldiers to build camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed to help the soldiers to cut trees, Tiramisu set up a cauldron, ready to cook his best meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked for a shade of trees, spread out the map on the grass, and continued to study the surrounding situation. At this moment, his consciousness suddenly fluctuated, and the sound of the mother's nest sounded: "Master, found a place in the goblin camp, the number is about two hundred, ready to clean up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, pay attention to your own safety." Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes? This kind of combat is low, but the creatures that are incomparably strong in their ability to reproduce and adapt to the environment often appear in all planes. If there is a goblin in this plane, it means that the similarity with Noland is further enhanced. Moreover, as far as the observations of the surrounding environment are observed these days, the food on this continent is more abundant than Noland, and the number of various biological populations is also more abundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
