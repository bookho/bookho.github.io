			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you create so many magic rides?" Richard couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your construction knight needs a magic ride, I created a batch of spares in advance. This magic ride adds extra strength and life, and is given Their primary intelligence. I believe they will be qualified riders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now accepted the maverick’s maverick, in fact, A mother's nest that can be judged on its own is actually more important, because Richard will not be longer and longer in Faro's time, and it is difficult to continuously update the instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of magic rides is actually a little more, even if there is more than one month of buffer time, Richard actually only needs twenty horses is enough. So he smiled and said: "But the number of magic rides is really more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not much, master." The mother said, then raised A proposal that shocked Richard: "You can take the magic ride back to Noland for sale. Compare the information of the knights you gave me. I think the current magic ride is at least compared to the common ride of the second-order knight. It has obvious advantages. It has an overwhelming advantage for the ordinary first-order knight mount. You can sell a good price, and then remember to assign the magic crystal that you exchanged to me. The analysis of abilities requires a lot of magic crystals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, I know." In the face of a too smart mother's nest, Richard has some headaches. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this batch of thirty-headed magic rides, five of them are specially sold for sale. I have extra landscaping for them to see It's taller, stronger, and fierce, but in fact there is no substantial improvement in ability. In addition, the vitality of these magical rides seems to be stronger than that for your own use, but in fact their lives are only between four and six years. When time is up, they will die with various symptoms. The standard life of your own magic ride is ten years. If you encounter a knight on the battlefield using the magic ride, you can use your unicorn. Let those magic rides die immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very speechless, and the nest is now more than just clever, in an ordinary magic ride. It is possible to lay down so many traps and it seems that insidiousness is more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me the information of various family resolutions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the release, a huge amount of information was sent. Richard carefully browsed the data, and then saw that the racial resolution of more than 100% is human, dwarf, goblin, caveman, etc., a total of twelve. And the number of races with resolutions is as many as hundreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians, dwarves, orcs and elves that Richard is very concerned about have reached 100%, and the elves have even reached 115%. Now the hen's nest has been re-optimized and the resolution is 115%. This means that the genie creates a genie power of 1.15 times that of the normal genie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the data of the elves, Richard found that the race was unexpectedly weak. The average elf level is only seven, only slightly stronger than humans. In this way, even if the mother's nest creates an eleven-level elf shooter, the number will be greatly limited due to the increase in capacity. With the ability of the seventh-order parent nest, only two can be created each day, which is completely worth the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very disappointed. He passed the elf column and continued to look down, but suddenly saw a green elf! Richard remembered that he had sent people to the bodies of the Green Elf to Faro. He just wanted to see what the Brood could figure out and increase the resolution of the Elf race. I did not expect the Green Sen Elf to be a brand new species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson Elf has a poor resolution of only 2%. However, from the known data, the green genie's racial abilities are far above the Faro's elves. Initial judgment of the mother nest, the average level of the Green Sens should be at level 12. This data is even stronger than many of Elland's elf races, probably only under the high elves such as the Silver Moon Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, through the cover of the night, several feather snakes vacated from the military camp, they carried the crows and greens that had just been transported to the Faro plane. The body of the Sen Elf flew to the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a whole hour to browse through the vast amount of information, so he breathed a sigh of relief. After thinking about it, he said to his mother's nest: "Use all the divinity of all your reserves, all to strengthen your own defense and physical resilience. Next we will face a life and death battle, at the most At a critical time, it is possible that you also need to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the ordinary sanctuary is by no means my opponent." The mother's nest replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was a little relieved and said with a smile: "But this time it must be a group of sanctuaries, or Noland’s standard. Well, in During this month, you will all create a feather snake and be able to squirt the poisonous mist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, the poisonous fog will make the power of the feather snake Falling, they have no way to kill the enemy at once. Strong enemies can even die after a week of poisoning, and they can live if they have a priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laughed and said: "This time our opponents have everything, there is no sacred officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan the Great official assured him, although the Faro plane The coordinates were leaked, but the plane number in the temple was definitely not a problem. That is to say, even if the coordinates of the other party's portal are directed to Faro's time lighthouse, the temporary passage constructed cannot legally use the function of the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor and the priests are absolutely not willing to pass through the plane channel without the lighthouse of the time. The true god brand will give the ectopic face a bright enough guide, God. Under the penalty, the source of faith burns, even the pope of powerful power is hard to escape. The only exception is the priest of the eternal and time dragon, but even they dare not easily set foot in the temporary passage without the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already ready to assemble a heavy battle with the enemy to fight a tough time lighthouse battle, and Philen brought the intruder to transfer the door. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the entire oasis city boiled up, and a team of soldiers left Oasis City in an orderly manner, heading to Richard’s scheduled battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom also mobilized and formed a coalition under the call of the royal family, ready to pass through the Principality of the White Rock and the other three principalities. Passage, go to the Baroque Kingdom to participate in the war. Although the number of this coalition is not many, but the lineup is quite luxurious, the Masters Association sent five of the ten great magisters to join the army. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Richard accepted the goddess of the three goddesses and prepared to fight with the invaders, many aristocrats in the Sequoia Kingdom immediately changed their minds. The troops that were originally prepared to join the royal expeditionary army were transferred back and applied to join the team of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard and the nobles worked together more than once, so the nobles were very aware of Richard’s requirements for the officers and command. The two vertical wars have shown that the troops will not only win more victories under Richard, but also have much less casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
