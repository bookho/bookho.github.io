			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several elf shooters surround the death knight's cheekbones, kneel, carefully After checking for a while, he said, "It has been completely wiped out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Druids came from the direction of the tree of life, one of them asked: “Can you be sure that it saw the tree of life?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall elf shooter said: “It must have seen the tree of life, I am sure, watching At the moment of the tree of life, it has a clear emotional reaction. It is not known whether it is possible to pass the position of the tree of life back to the invader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elder Druid nodded and asked one of the old Druids around him: "The green wind elder, you have fought with the invaders, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old Druid is the last green wind escaped in the last war, and the most radical representative of the Green Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Wind looked at the death knight and said: "The intruders are very embarrassed and have many means that we have never heard of. They have sent a lot of undead creatures. Exploring the forest, there must be means to explore through these evil things, just as we can place our soul on the flying eagle that the icon is formed. So I think we should follow the original plan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Druid, who looks the oldest, said slowly: "This is the best! If the intruders dare to come here, then the sons of the forest will definitely take them all. Stay, as the price of destroying the forest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind is shocked and happy, busy asking: "Will the great son of the forest come? Which forest son? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid said: "The news that the tree of life just sent me, the revenge spear will arrive tomorrow morning."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind flashed a trace of viciousness and said: "Great! The son of the forest is willing to intervene, the intruder will I will not be able to leave the forest. At that time, I will plant a row of eater trees and then hang them all on the eater tree. Let them know the cost of destroying the forest!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the scorpion tree, even a few Green Sen elf shooters showed a hint of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And outside the base city, Richard also appeared next to the summoning circle, watching Sandrue sweating and controlling the summoning circle. The body will tremble from time to time. This is another sign that the undead is destroyed. Every dead soul will die, and Sandru will be hit once. He now equals the soul connection with each undead through the summoning circle. When needed, the undead will send everything he sees to Sandro, seeing everything in the eyes of the undead, will be seen by the Necromancer. However, in this way, there is a bridge between the undead and Sandru, and when the undead is hit, Sandru will also be hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the destruction of the death knight was centered, and the undead were quickly destroyed, and Sandro was repeatedly hit. However, the Necromancer clenched his teeth and said that he would not give up control of the summoning circle. Every time he insists on it for a while, he will collect more information about the Green Sen. After a while, even Agamemnon was moved. The power of the Necromancer's will and soul is undoubted at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard are very strong in terms of soul and will. I didn’t expect him to be a necromancer from the ectopic face. A powerful soul. The soul and the will are inseparable and integral. If the soul is weak and the will is strong, then Sandru’s insistence is like suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard said: "Sandru, yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead mage is full of sweat, his eyes are bloodshot, but still insert his hands Magical images, trying to stabilize the magic of input. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can still hold on for a while, Master!" Sandro's voice has been completely hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns, just want to order the Necromancer to stop, and the sand flowing beside him suddenly raises his hand, and a sacred glory falls on Sander! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the audience, the audience was shocked, and even Sander himself was scared to death. The most feared by the Necromancer is the magic, and any god's magic is afraid. For the creatures, the magical energy of the big complement is placed on the undead as a deadly poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after Sandre’s shock, he discovered that the magical energy of the sands did not burn his undead as expected, but was completely isolated from the undead. Do not interfere with each other and do not touch each other. However, the effect of the magic is still apparent. The periphery of Sandro's soul began to flash amber, and the impact of the soul hit by this layer was blocked by this layer of amber, and the necromancer was obviously a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul guardian is a very common and widely used magical technique, mainly used to prevent such things as death, death, banshee and the like. A spell with a dead effect. However, this magical blessing to the undead master who is best at such spells, but it seems unspeakable irony and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the people looking at the sand are already shocked. The ability to bless the demon to the Necromancer, the oracle is really omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Sandro’s magic will be exhausted and he has to stop the control of the summoning circle. Deep in the forest, the undead, who were still moving forward straight, suddenly fell into stagnation, and after a while began to wandering in accordance with instinct without purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru took a short break and stood up again to start casting. There is a huge magic light curtain in front of him, and the light curtain is a huge tree of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few green awns in the light curtain, which quickly flies, and then the picture trembles violently, then dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-release it again!" said Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru re-directed the picture that the death knight saw and settled on the tree of life. Nyris carefully distinguished for a long time and decided to say: "Yes, it must be the tree of life! Where is the position, can you be sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru Nodded, used magic images to simulate the extent of the forest, and then marked a striking red dot in it, saying: "It can be determined that the death knight is the tree of life seen here, 240 km from the base city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked aside and said: "The other party must have been alert. Now the raid is meaningless. We take a rest and start tomorrow morning, tomorrow in the forest. In the camp, the next morning attacked the tree of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris frowned: "Those Green Sens have lost a tree of life, this time again. Now, I will definitely do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and punched his fist, saying: "So we are concentrating this time, pushing it in the past! Even green The Sen Elf wants to ambush us, and we flatten him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris eyes brightened: "That can be another hard battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has a small mouth and said: "You will not be afraid of this defeat, can I be afraid?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahaha smiled and said: "Last time I won!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris said: "If I can Let go of the use of vindictive, you will lose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon said faintly: "Winning and losing half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese almost jumped up: "How is it possible??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The duel." Agamemnon said a word that didn't end. Nyris immediately remembered the duel between Richard and Little Mensa, and the powerful blood-stained lightning! The lightning can't be evaded at all. If it falls on his head, Nyris will be seriously injured if he does not die. He can do his best to fight for life, and the same is true for the royal sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Agamemnon will say that the two sides are fighting hard, and now they win and lose two points. Although Richard’s sacrifice is costly, it also has the power corresponding to the price. In particular, Richard is now able to use seven levels of magic, a chain of lightning that adds sacrifice, spell penetration, and power through the fate of the Twins. Even the Sanctuary is on the helm of the half. It can be said that the current Richard is already a guy who will have some headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris snorted and went back to battle to prepare, instead of tangling and Richard's duel who won the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, a large team set off from the base city and went straight to the tree of life that was discovered. The size of this team has reached 500, all of which are composed of elites of level 10 and above, and everyone is armed to the teeth, and the supply is abundant to the point of horrible. In the base city, Richard left dozens of low-level mages, and with the help of three magic towers, even if the indigenous people took the emptiness to attack the city, they could not beat the base city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard used the illusion of the soldiers, so that the Green Sen Elf was defeated in a row, even the tree of life was robbed of a living. He does not believe that the Green Sen Elves dare to attack the base city. Who knows if this is another trap set by Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred soldiers marched in the forest for a day and then camped at night. Unlike last time, this night there were many green elves coming to the night, but they eventually lost a few bodies, but they found nothing. There are not a few strong men who are good at jungle night fighting, including Scherr, the sanctuary. However, the result of counting the night battles, but the top pick is the twilight, this result is very unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard originally wanted to catch a few captives to torture, but because of the super-level of the twilight, he only caught a seriously injured Green Sen. Because the twilight of the hand never leaves alive, especially for the Green Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Green Forest Elf is extremely determined, and the soul is protected by a mysterious force. When the Necromancer wants to cast a spell on his search for soul memory, The elf screamed, and the soul was broken directly, and died, so that Richard did not get any information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
