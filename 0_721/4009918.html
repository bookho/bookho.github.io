			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hooked a wolf head with a magic pen and stopped at the north route of Richard In front of it, then move the rest of the wolf head, respectively, from the East and West, blocking the road in both directions, while leaving only one unit in the south, slowly following the north of Richard. Saranwell himself is also in this unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north, at the junction of the blood-stained land and the Iron Triangle Empire, three sly marks have been placed. They formed a pocket and waited for Richard to get in. The closer to the destination, the fewer marching routes are available. Sometimes, victory seems to be within reach, and overturning is also within one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranville looked at the whole picture before giving the order and suddenly frowned. On the map, Richard’s past marching line formed a series of complex S-shaped shapes. Although he seemed to be trying to escape to the north, he is now 30 kilometers northward than the original starting point of the battle, but it is still eastward. Run more than two hundred kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this line, Saranwell’s heart floated a bad feeling: "No! This guy doesn’t want to go north, the real purpose is I want to consume my strength in the sports battle? Oops! The number of casualties is a bit too big. These people are not the soldiers of the empire! This kind of casualties will inevitably make those guys timid and will not let go. The speed is decided!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the map and began to re-examine the battlefield situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magic clock in the carriage sounded a few crisp bells, and the young female mage reminded him that the lunch time had arrived. So he stopped thinking, put down the magic pen, and got off the carriage with the two female assistants. The team has stopped and waits for Saranwell to board another carriage before moving on. The white linen tablecloth has been placed on the dining table in the carriage, and the sumptuous lunch is served in sterling silver tableware and placed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This carriage is actually a simple dining car! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few carriages also include a rest car for sleeping and meditation, as well as a number of trucks for delivery, and two for the chef’s maid. Living caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranville’s lunch was eaten for two hours before returning to the office car. Lunch time is also the time for him to think and meet, so it is not a waste of time. But as soon as I got back to the office car, the new information made him immediately lock his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally heading north, but suddenly turned to the east, defeated a cavalry unit in the east, and went away, temporarily lost the trail. . The battle was fierce and fierce. The troops who had more than five hundred rides killed nearly one hundred and fifty rides and were completely defeated instead of taking the initiative to retreat. Therefore, they were not able to arrange a detective ride to smuggle Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, on the battlefield, the follow-up reinforcements only found the bodies of the eleven men, most of them slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the east... Is his real purpose to return to the Sequoia Kingdom?" Salenwell was somewhat uncertain. In the news he has mastered, the earliest trace of Richard’s appearance is the border of the Sequoia Kingdom. Generally speaking, it is indeed necessary to prevent Richard from escaping to the mainland first, but everyone also knows the origins of these people in the blood-stained land. It must not be true to see. Moreover, from the very beginning, the intent of Richard's north was very obvious, and Allenwell believed that it was not disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the battle record of this battle made him feel incredible, able to kill more than 150 experienced cavalry in a short battle of ten minutes, which is simply impossible according to the combat effectiveness of the Richards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Saranwell finally made up his mind to see Richard’s battle, and told the young female assistant to prepare the horse and the magic scroll, and let the accompanying In the guardian knight, fifty elite knights were drawn, and he immediately rushed to the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this decision attracted the euphemism of the two female mages. They think that in the case of insufficient defensive power, it is unsuitable for him to commit a crime, and this hunting was originally his temporary intention. Seeing the hunter, he took command from the red Cossack. Now it has been delayed for a long time because of the pursuit of Richard. If there is any danger for this incident, then they will be executed after returning to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their view, as one of the possible heirs of the future of the empire, the importance of Salenville is higher than that of a thief group that does not know it at all. Thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort captain also stood on the side of two female mage, his attitude is more determined, bluntly is the key moment for the throne, the Imperial secret forces have gone south, Don't be better off the branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort captain was a close confidant with Saronville for many years, so the Master began to hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two horses came from afar as if they were flying, they sent two pieces of information, so that the calm and calm Saarwell also wrinkled Frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An intelligence claim that the secret army of the Iron Triangle Empire has arrived in the Sequoia Kingdom, and joins the private army of the two Marquis of the Sequoia Kingdom and the Temple of the Spirit of the Spirit. It consists of an elite army of 2,000 people, including two hundred Knights of the Temple, two hundred imperial knights, and more than 10 priests. The troops have been completed and they are waiting for him to take over the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the latest emergency report, which said that the black face of the ectopic demon has broken the oasis of dusk, slaughtered more than two thousand people, and established A servant army of more than 3,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand people!" Salenwell smiled mockingly and said: "It seems that our friends from afar have sent to all active people." A weapon. Ok, let me see the map first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the big map, marked the position where his troops met, and then looked Looking at the location of the oasis at dusk, I finally sighed and told the team to turn to the secret troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now in the north of the blood-stained land. He wants to rush to the confined confluence point within three days and must leave immediately. Once the time of the division is exceeded, the political enemy will seize the opportunity to attack the accusation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell reluctantly looked at the densely marked mark in the northern part of the blood-stained land, and sighed deeply again. Those marks represent a suffocating battle, and there are times when he makes a big surprise and the incredible results of each battle. The wolves he sent were biting on the prey, only causing little damage to the prey, but each time they broke their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha...get alive! Wait for a chance, let me know what a strategic advantage is, hehe!" He shook his head. In the eyes of Salenville, Richard is now a genius general, but not a real commander. And he himself is the lord, even the emperor, who is above the commander. Only the latter still needs hard work and certain luck. After all, the Iron Triangle Imperial Emperor is not too long, and there are already more than 70 princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
