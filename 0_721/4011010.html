			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small adjustment made without face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the strong guys pay for the points battlefield, the less likely they will leave. They always feel that they have earned enough, and there is nothing they want to redeem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registration fee is charged, which naturally makes Richard earn another. But this is a trivial matter, and the new list is the top priority. Unsurprisingly, there is another heavy cargo in this list: the fifth-order construction of petrochemical gaze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the instructions, you can know the value of this fifth-order structure, and the 3500 redemption points are equally sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme was stunned when he saw this list. He naturally guessed that this petrified gaze had a relationship with the Medusa head that he had exchanged. What he didn't think of was the time when Richard turned the material into a construction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he doesn’t make a framed layman, he knows the basic process. This requires processing the material, requires parsing rules, needs to condense the magical soul, and needs to draw. Drawing is not necessarily successful, every link can be wrong, and there are too many examples of ruining a whole package with one mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, Richard is still fighting the Reaper. Taking these factors into consideration, Romney roughly estimated the time spent by Richard on the construction of this structure: twenty days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an incredible number, but it seems that the only identity of the architect of Richard Nalander seems to be miraculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a big magician took a photo of Romne and asked, "How come here?" There is something you want in this list. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme returned to God and said, "No. I just think...His Royal Highness is too great." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this new petrochemical gaze? Of course, His Highness, Richard, is amazing, and it still needs you to say it. Don't forget the Highness of His Royal Highness. Who is the teacher, that is the Highness of Su Hailun! So it is normal for the assembly of the Highness. You are not a Master. I don’t know that Deep Blue has become the first holy place of all the Masters in the mainland. Countless young talented wizards have broken their heads. Think of dark blue to learn! Don't say anything else, just in the alchemy class, there are hundreds of rare materials that can be used for refining! What a rare opportunity, oh, you are not a mage, and you said I don't understand. If I had such a learning opportunity, I would have risen to the 20th level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the inexhaustible magister, Romney is only the only Nono. Of course, he knows that he must not say the things of Medusa's head, and he can't make the guess of his heart public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the big magister to finish, the absent-minded Roma said: "His Royal Highness is really amazing!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician only felt that the explanations he had just made were in vain. He took a forehead and sighed: "Are you not nonsense? Is it not great for Your Royal Highness? Is it now? Found?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Roma to nod and force it: “Really found now!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big magician shouted, I don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme suddenly said: "I want to join Archimonde and follow His Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician was shocked and almost jumped up and said, "Are you crazy?! If you join now, you have to fight the reaper! That is the reaper, we are not legendary, It’s already very difficult to kill the devil here. Although Archimonde’s pension is very high, don’t you really want your family to get this pension?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The big magician’s words not only did not persuade Romney, but let him light his eyes: “I have already decided! Even if I die, it’s no big deal. But if I can survive this war without dying In the future, Noland’s history will inevitably leave my name!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister is staring at Romney and saying, “You really "It's crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not crazy! Go with me too!" Romney instead dragged the Magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister hurried to break free and shouted: "I don't want to go crazy with you! Don't go, say nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome looked at him eagerly and said, "We are good friends, I will not harm you. I think this may be the last chance, miss this opportunity, I just want to sign a magical slavery contract with His Royal Highness, and there is no chance! Let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" The big magician said that he was arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romney looked at the great magister very, very regrettable, and finally turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the back of Roma, the big magician suddenly felt a flustered, and muttered: "It’s not like what the guy said, Have you missed a chance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately remembered the horror of the reaper, and the rumors of the death and injury on the battlefield of Faro points. The upper hand, I finally looked at Roma. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard is in the semi-planet star laboratory, using the ancient experimental bench to analyze the parts removed from the reaper. On the bench is the construction of a small fighter, and now the details are gradually being improved. As the progress of the analysis progressed, a weak link began to appear on the fighter plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic bell suddenly sounds when the structure diagram is about to be perfected. This is a signal that someone is summoning Richard, which is a relatively important level. Richard immediately stopped the analysis, left the semi-level, and returned to his own palace in Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the palace of the palace, Roma is standing nervously, waiting for the fate of the verdict. He couldn't restrain his inner tension and simply walked to the floor-to-ceiling window and wanted to calm himself with the view from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scene outside the window caught his attention. In the distance, we can see that there are two huge transmission arrays. From the perspective of scale and light, it must be the array of planes transmitted between planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what surprised Roma was that it was not the army waiting for the transfer, but the civilians of the brigade. Looking at the civilians once into the transmission array, Romney could not help but stunned. Of course, he knows the cost of transferring between planes. Even if Richard strengthens the channel to the highest level, the transmission cost will not be less than one hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These civilians send once, that is, tens of thousands of gold coins are gone. The queues waiting to be transmitted are long, at least tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome looked at God, and suddenly he heard the voice of Richard: "That is the newly built portal, the two that lead to me." Private planes. Through them, my people here will withdraw to those two planes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Romney looked back at Richard, he was shocked. During the period, Ai Ai said: "His Royal Highness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out Referring to the sofa, he smiled and said, "Sit down. I heard that you intend to be one of my followers? You should know what it means at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme has the courage to say: "I know. To sign a magic contract, I have to fight the Reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep smiling and say, "It is very likely to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard nodded and said, "Well, my time is precious. You give me a reason, why should I be my follower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Because..." Romney kept thinking about the reason, suddenly there was a surge of blood, saying: "I know that you are a very, very amazing person, so I want to follow your footsteps, but also Leave your own mark in history "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard's gaze, Romne gnawed his teeth again: "I know that you can make a holy costume within twenty days! Even design And condensing the magical soul, so...so I have this idea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words are exported, Roma is like a collapse. Kneel on the sofa and pant out loud. The strength of the whole body has been lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally nodded and said, "I think this is also the reason. But you can say it, this is good. In my place, honest. People will definitely get rewards. So I can give you this opportunity, but there will be no preferential treatment in the battle, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome's teeth "I understand! It was a bit tricky to get this opportunity. The battle with the Reaper is my test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a magical slave scroll, He handed it to Romney and said, "This war is indeed a test, but I hope that each of you can live to the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme Take the magic slavery reel, open it, then bite your teeth and sign your name on it. From this moment on, he bid farewell to the past, and he has embarked on a road full of thorns but full of sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
