			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare opportunity, after the fall of the Elven Wang Ting of the Everlasting Forest The high elf lost the last base in the human territory. In addition to his own mother, Richard has not seen the second silver moon elf, and his knowledge of his blood, Richard can only rely on the various collections in the dark blue. The books of the Elven Empire were borrowed, but the true inheritance was carefully collected and not circulated, or even there was no written record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said with pride: "In the five world trees of my elf's blood, the magic star world tree has risen to the fifth order, and awakened the real name. Saron, in addition, the other four world trees have reached the fourth order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of Richard is not without reason, there is still Noland Many elves survive, and the dark blue also stores a lot of information about the elves. Most elves, like humans, can't awaken the blood power in their lifetime. Most of the elves who can awaken the blood power can only activate a world tree. This is a good warrior or a magician. You can join the regular army during the Elven Empire. The middle and lower ranks of the officers who can activate the two world trees are the lower-level sacrifices of the temple. The requirements of the high elves are to activate the three world trees. It is the minimum standard. Such people will be senior officers in the regular army or intermediate sacrifices and masters. This is the watershed dividing the high elves and ordinary elves. The high elves are the aristocratic classes of the Elven Empire. Their blood Excellent, awakening the family tree of the world's three talent often, and if a family awakening blood elf forces are not enough, that means the family is about to decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are different from human beings. Their blood power is incomparably pure. They are basically all kinds of world trees, so from the time of the Elven Empire, the blood force is detected. The method has been quite complete. Even in the late period of the empire, even special detection magic was invented. It is also a lot of detection equipment capable of detecting part of the blood potential. There is rarely a problem of talent burial, and human beings are more like a hodgepodge. Awakened with a variety of blood, almost all of Norland's slightly more powerful races can be related to humans, and humans are eclectic, not only a strong race, but also the blood of weak races awakened a lot, these foreign abilities Whether it is strong or weak, it can always play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, quantitative changes will always cause qualitative changes, as well as blood types, just because humans awaken more kinds of blood, so almost always in any environment Finding the right talents, under those famous people, as long as there is a skillful person who can use it well, over time, it will cause the human territory to expand, and occupy half of the Noland continent. Interestingly, when it comes to When it comes to race, humans always like to treat the Barbados barbarians as their own, and the barbarians never admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Li Wake up all five world trees, and he was enough to become a member of the royal family during the Elven Empire. Of course, the Silver Moon Elves were originally one of the royal families among the high elves, but like Richard, they were able to put five worlds. It is rare to see all the trees evolved to the fourth order. If you return to the period of the Elven Empire, Richard can at least mix a general, and his men can command thousands of miscellaneous soldiers, or three hundred elves to reload the guards, but the higher. The elf is extremely exclusive. If Richard really returns to the Elven Empire, he will be arrested and then smothered with a venom. The reason is that he has the blood of human beings, and his blood is enough. He became the defendant in the imperial court, and then publicly pronounced the sentence and was buried under the world tree to become the nutrients of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the era of the Elven Empire is already a past tense, its power and brilliance are unquestionable. Until today, none of the six empire of Noland has been able to reach A small part of the strength of the Elven Empire during the glory days, so whenever he thought he could be among the royals during the Elven Empire, Richard was quite proud of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a little surprised: "Five life trees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, illusion Stars, moon power, life, nature and elements." Richard answered with certainty and in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 Nodded and said: "You can evolve five life trees to the fourth order, and the magic star has evolved a fifth-order real name. It is really not easy." But how could it be five life trees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Li, and said, "It’s not five. It should be a few."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand up, don't resist, let me see it first." He said, waving a natural spell on Richard, this green energy into the body Immediately activated all the blood power of Richard's elves, so on top of his head, there were five leafy trees of life, and the star-studded fantasy tree was particularly eye-catching, half the height of the other four trees. Its canopy has no solid branches and leaves, all of which consist of beautiful and mysterious stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 After a while, I sighed and said, “It’s really five life trees, oh...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a bit incomprehensible, but his disappointment was obvious. The problem is that Richard feels that he has not much room for improvement. Is it necessary to evolve the other four life trees to five? Stage, all awaken the real name to make her satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the doubts of Richard, smiled and said: "Whether, anyway, my strength is not much, there is nothing to waste, let me see my blood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sturdy and pure natural force emerges from the body of the cockroach, gathers on top of her head, and finally condenses into an image, but there is only one world tree on the top of the cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the world tree became clearer, Richard was shocked. The world tree was so tall and tall, twice as tall as Richard’s magic star. The majesty and momentum that it exudes is far above the magic star, not to mention the other tree of life. This kind of magic that detects and displays the blood of the elf shows the image completely standard, which means more powerful. The blood of the blood will appear in the larger world tree at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what really shocked Richard was that the world tree trunks of the world are showing the color of pale gold, and the texture is like metal. This is not a simple image. It means that the nature of the power of this world tree is fundamentally different from that of Richard. When he saw the golden world tree, Richard realized that it was not a slip of the tongue, and that his five small trees really should be called. life Tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 sighed and said: "I and Elani are the blood of the golden world tree, and Ilani’s blood is more pure than me, when we When she showed the talented world tree together, her world tree was taller and the color was pure golden yellow, but I didn’t expect that you were like other silver moon elves, and the five trees of life were awakened, perhaps I asked too much. It is quite good to be able to evolve all five life trees to this extent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed comfort rather than praise, Richard Looking at the golden world tree, I observed that there are five large branches in the golden world tree, which represent five different blood powers. The five life trees of my own are on the body, just five. The branches are just around the corner, and at the center of the Golden World tree there is a branch that grows straight up, and the whole body is brilliant gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 sighed again and said: "Only the blood of the golden world tree can become the great elf king, or the great sacrifice of the temple of the moon, originally seen You, I still want to... still want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See you didn’t say it, Richard asked: "Hey, what do you want me to do, though Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 smiled and said, "I want you to go to the green continent, go to the elf empire there, become one of the big elf kings." Bring those guys out of enoutment, pride and hatred, but this is just my delusion, don't take it seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
