			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee laughed, shook his head, let go of the sand, and came to the table , began to carefully examine a piece of animal skin on the table. It was a cut animal skin with a complete magical array drawn on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Are you ready for work?" The sand does not seem to be ready to let go of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s left hand was gently stroking over the hide, and through the extremely sharp touch of the fingertips, the tiniest shackles of the magical array could not escape him. Perception. While making the final inspection, he said: "Yes, this is the construction for the Gangde, the primary strength. Although it is only the initial level of construction, it is very suitable for Gangde. With his power of the earth, completely You can give the enemy a very big surprise during the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This does not seem to be an ordinary primary force." Liu Sha suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was amazed, but he was used to the brilliance of the sand, so he explained: "This structure of the primary power has changed. When it is needed, it will be stimulated. The instantaneous power increase can exceed 50%. The shortcoming is that it requires vindictiveness, and the continuous consumption is double that of ordinary primary strength. Even with the physical strength of Gangde, it is estimated that it will last for up to five minutes in the excited state. But in the battle, with the power of his earth, this structure can make his combat power surge instantly, and the enemy with the same strength is likely to be killed by him during the double outbreak."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds somewhat similar to your bloodline burst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "It’s indeed from Inspired by the outbreak, but my blood ability should not only be an outbreak, but the ability to break out seems to continue to be strengthened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This construct... ..." The sand touches the image that has become a work of art. The animal skin, seems to think of something, more and more surprised. "I have never heard of such a structure, and can be combined with the ability of talent. Richard, you made a very great thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not so exaggerated?" Richard said with a smile. "Compared with the primary strength, this structure is only a marginal increase, but the cost is also a significant increase in consumption. Perhaps passive improvement has become The active outbreak is also a change, but the meaning does not seem to be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand broke his head and said, "No, it’s not that simple. If you think of this structure as What is an ability? It is almost no different from the bursting of your blood. The only difference is that the increase is not as strong as your outburst. However, how many people in the world can have the ability to carry blood? But relatively capable of carrying the structure There are a lot of people. I heard that the ability to simulate the ability of the bleeding pulse is at least third, and you have achieved the third-order ability with a first-order configuration. Richard, have you ever thought about it, use one The ability to simulate the third-order construction If you can do ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Richard body startled, then the flow of sand in front of him opened up a unprecedented way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all the third-order structures flowed through his heart. At this moment, the extremely solid foundation of the cultivation of the deep blue five-year high-intensity learning played a role, and numerous problems were instantly solved one by one, so Richard discovered that even more than half of the third-order structure can be reduced in performance. For the cost, simulate it with a first-order construction! Even individual fourth-order configurations can handle this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, another new fuzzy idea, such as lightning, passed through Richard's heart. He seemed to have grasped something, but it seemed to have no gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha..." Liusha had just called out, and Richard immediately raised his hand and made her quiet. And he is staring out the window, but the focus of the line of sight has not been known. His brain is running at a constant speed, trying to capture the inspiration that has just passed away, but the content that needs to be considered is so huge, even Richard, who has a talent for wisdom, begins to feel a sharp headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the headache was about to split, Richard suddenly caught the inspiration! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you have to do a standard build? The idea of ​​most builders is to make a standard assembly, and then based on the standard structure, according to the different physical conditions of the object, design the so-called construction program. Standard construction is a standard, in fact, because after thousands of years of perfection, they are actually a very mature design, achieving a considerable degree of stability, performance, applicability and cost. balance. It can be said that the mass-produced knight can be the most extreme embodiment of the standard structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the standard assembly is not entirely suitable for everyone's requirements. Any strong person has different qualities, different abilities, and the higher the level, the more so. Therefore, in the real high-ranking strong, it is difficult for the standard assembly to fully exert their combat effectiveness. Therefore, the real masters of the decoration will tailor a set of construction schemes according to the characteristics of each of the strong ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pattern can be science, but more art. If the standard construction is scientific, then the tailor-made construction scheme is art. The heights of the great constructors are distinguished by artistic standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Richard realized that why Deep Blue had a large number of art subjects such as paintings in his tailor-made curriculum design. After the most rigorous and open-minded art training, Richard discovered that it was not just a road but a brand new world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art is a soul, the real construction plan may be one, maybe a few, no matter how many structures are composed, and regardless of these structures Whether it is a few orders, they should be a complete whole with the object that accepts the structure, have the same theme, the same soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at the sand, and said seriously: "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Liu Sha seriously looked at Richard's eyes, his face slowly piled up with a smile. This time it is no longer a shallow smile, but more and more bright and bright. Until then, Richard discovered that the most beautiful time of the drifting sand was when she smiled happily. This moment of flowing sand, glamorous is not a square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you should thank me." Liu Sha smiled and gently tapped Richard's chest with his finger and said, "In fact, you have very Talent is also very talented, and even has many valuable qualities. But your character is very problematic, you are very introverted, very persistent, and very proud, but on the other hand it is very sensitive and fragile. When I even think that you are more like a poet, I will collect my heart all day and let it immerse in melancholy and sorrow, as if all the people in the plane hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face is slightly red, and he angered: “Flowing sand!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand vomited and spit out his tongue, and quickly said: Ok, okay, I won’t say it. In fact, what you have always lacked is self-confidence!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
