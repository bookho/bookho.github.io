			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly, master!" The elf poet suddenly took out the short sword, a Pulling up the hair of a waitress on the ground, lifting her life, and then taking a short sword to pat her face with a blurred makeup, just as she barely smiled, the short sword suddenly cut, so her Hands fly out of the body immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s screams immediately sounded, and Richard’s face was slightly indifferent. He said, “Oral! What are you doing? You have to cut this. The guy's finger! Not the woman's hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet took the hair of the hostess, turned her to Richard, and then shook it twice, one quite A small, magical scroll was smashed out of her bra. Before he could wait for it to fall into the blood, Oral reached out and copied it to Richard. Just looking at it, Richard knew that it was a warning scroll, and the use was to let a specific magic clock ring when it was torn open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small game that has been circulated among the upper aristocrats. It is similar to a magic toy, but it is quite practical. I didn’t expect the waitress in this bar to hide one. It seems that her status is not simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, this woman wants to secretly report. If you want to escape, you have to chop your feet, then the chopper who wants to pass the message should be right." Pull to defend himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave me alone, come over and do what you should do!" Richard said coldly. The Elf poet is very clever, has loyalty and a magical slavery contract guarantee, but as the nature gradually reveals, it has become less and less flattering. But he is an indispensable role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bartender pressed firmly on the bar, Oral gracefully wiped the blood on the dagger and asked, "Master, be quick. Is it still slow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to let him speak," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gangde has replaced him as a bartender, so Richard can find a bottle of real good wine on the wine cabinet and pour himself for himself. Take a cup, then lean on the bar and wait for the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral looked at the bartender's finger and said to Gangde: "Use your axe."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral’s eyelids turned over and said, “Because it’s rough enough!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Gangde loves to listen to, and he handed over the giant axe and said, "Be careful, this thing is heavy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet snorted and raised a big axe, it was very helpful. As a nine-level bard, although he can't use a heavy axe, it's not a problem to pick it up. However, it is one thing to pick it up. It is another thing to use it flexibly. As for the big guy to cut a finger, the difficulty is multiplied, not to mention the elf poet’s desire to do it. The root finger is to be cut in seven or eight times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the first attempt was an accident. The big axe was a little bit off, and it was erratic. As a result, the barista index finger was used according to the weight of the axe itself. The last quarter is completely smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender screamed and even broke away from the hand of Gangde holding his mouth!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet was sweating, and he was struggling to carry a giant axe. He was dissatisfied and screamed: "What the ghost is! Now this finger can only be cut again. I want to say something, I will finish it and say it! Nobody now. I want to hear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said! I said everything!" The bartender collapsed completely. He finally recognized a reality. The people in front of him were sinister. Nothing is worse than Stick and Red Gosack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the elf poet is shaking with the hand of the giant axe, the axe blade may fall at any time, and the bartender immediately says everything he knows at the fastest speed. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Cossack is the largest slave trade group in the entire blood-stained place. There are naturally slave camps in the blue water oasis, and there is more than one, but more than one. The three big seven small and a total of ten camps, the limit can accommodate 30,000 slaves. There are always thousands of slaves in custody. In order to take care of such a large number of slaves, the Red Cossack placed a 300-strong escort in the local area. This is truly elite, not a peripheral team like Redwood Hook. But the real home base of the Red Cossacks is not here, but on the shore of the Moon Bay, more than a hundred kilometers away from the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Stick, it is a pivotal force in the Blue Water Oasis, with more than 200 cavalry soldiers and more than 400 soldiers. The main business of Shuangtoulong is to protect the order of the blue water oasis together with the other five forces. These six so-called forces are actually six organized armed forces, occasionally as mercenaries, and more often part-time robbers in the distance. The six forces that maintain the order of the blue water oasis are counted together as one party. There are two votes in the Oasis Parliament. The representative of the Human Sequoia Kingdom has four votes. The representative of the Marquis Anrik has one vote. As for the remaining ten votes. All of them belong to the major slave trade groups, and these ten seats are also the most frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis Parliament still has some authority. After all, the booming trade requires a relatively stable environment. However, when it comes to key benefits, off-site solutions that cannot be resolved at the venue are also common. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, according to the bartender, the two-headed dragon, Dick, has a strength of fourteen, and there are more than a dozen captains under the 12th level. The most powerful person in the entire blue water oasis is the plenipotentiary of the Marquis of Allek, the 16th-level Sanctuary Swordsman Luofu. Because of the existence of Luofu, it is also an important reason why the Marquis's Allek can occupy a vote in the Oasis Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bartender was here, the door of the bar was suddenly knocked open, and several drunks sang songs into the bar. But the bloody scene in the bar, the constant screams and screams immediately made their wines wake up three points. When their eyes touched a few of them and sat down, looking at the eyes of the people here, the hangover was already awake, and immediately nodded, and said with a smile: "Wrong, wrong!" The bar, then close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha picked up the glass, took a sip, threw the glass aside and said, "Yes. Prepare for the next fight!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the men got up, Olal took the bartender and asked, "What about this guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's put it!" Richard swayed and walked outside the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral’s hand was loose, and the bartender immediately fell to the ground, as if the next moment would faint. But when he stared at Richard's back, his eyes showed a trace of extreme grievance. Almost everyone followed Richard to leave the bar, including the sand that had never been moved, but the bartender always felt that something was wrong. He suddenly remembered that he did not see the beautiful but extremely vicious elf. He suddenly turned his head and looked back. The pupils reflected the reflection of the elf poet waving the short sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
