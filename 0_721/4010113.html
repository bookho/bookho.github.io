			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue water oasis city is already in chaos, countless people are running around, The road is full of carriages. People who keep getting news want to escape from Oasis City. Although there is no danger in the bloody land, the vast and complex terrain is the best defense. Escaped into the depths of the blood-stained land, that is, 100,000 troops have been unable to search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has stood in the blue water oasis city, his face is ugly, and the imperial cavalry that gradually unfolded outside the city has begun to take shape. At the end of the line of sight, there are also thousands of troops are coming. The two cavalry squads that arrived in advance totaled eight thousand cavalry, and now they are divided into two thousand, which are wrapped in the flank of Lanshui Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the two legions is only a few kilometers away from Oasis City. In the last section, the soldiers have slowed down and regained their strength to meet The upcoming war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around Richard, the aristocratic generals were pale, and some even began to tremble uncontrollably. The Emperor’s group is posing in a position of indiscriminate attack. Obviously, there is no fear of relying on one's own strength to counter all the power of Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and licked the stiff short hair on his chin, looking around for a week and said, "Remember the iron wall and magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocrats have a glimpse of the fierce battle of the Cracked Rock Canyon. But that was also the classic battle of Richard to show the control of the terrorist field and the magical killing power. After the war, all the nobles were full of confidence in Richard. At this moment, Richard recalled the campaign, and the nobles suddenly felt courage and confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took all the reactions of the nobles to the bottom of his eyes, so he smiled and said: "This time, let the guys of the Iron Triangle Empire taste the iron wall. And the taste of magic. But first... let me give them a lesson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard suddenly raised his voice and shouted: "Gangde ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head! All are ready! My big axe is already hungry and thirsty!" The ground came with the snoring of Gangde, and the giant The slap of the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles discovered that I did not know when there were hundreds of soldiers gathered inside the gate, including one hundred eagle knights, two hundred humanoid warriors and Two hundred throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles have some doubts, what do the five hundred fighters want to do, will not want to go out of town? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for them to understand, Richard has taken over the extinct and the nameless knife from the followers, crossed his back, carrying the fate of the twins, striding Going down the city, turning over the horse, then shouting: "Open the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles face each other, does Richard really want to leave the city? Just five hundred warriors, several followers and two holy areas? Although I saw many miracles in the hands of Richard, they still could not believe their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Hemki reacted differently. He suddenly became fascinated by the military. He grabbed a battle axe from a soldier nearby and shouted: "Wait for me! I will go too!" Then he rushed over and didn't understand the guards who yelled behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But eagerly, the Viscount could not find where his horse was. Some of his smart attendants saw that the situation was wrong, and he had long been holding his horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Shim, who was mad at his legs and panting, Richard could not help but laugh, shook his head, reached out and pointed to Him, and said, "Stand!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him really stood still and wanted to wait for Richard's next order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which knows that Richard no longer cares about him, but looks at the city gate that is slowly opening, his face is full of murderousness, and his destiny twins wave forward and shout : "Output!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle-flag knight slowed down the horse, and the five hundred warriors smashed out of the city, welcoming the imperial cavalry almost ten times opposite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general of the Iron Triangle Empire commanding the cavalry was first stunned and immediately furious! This is the most thorough provocation, trampling on the dignity of every true knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was as sinking as a water, but he did not say a word. He just pulled out the sword and went to the army that was weak and weak at any time. So the two cavalry thousands of people rushed out from the two wings, and then added to the high-speed, one left and one right, like a flood to attack Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two steel torrents are about to hit Richard’s weak army, the Syrian army suddenly shines a dazzling glory! So the dozens of fighters and knights in the front row are shining with glory, which is clearly a blessing of high-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial general’s pupils violently contracted, and the flash of the magical radiance in the distance almost dazzled his eyes! How many priests in the team of warriors can release such a large number of brilliant and brilliant magic? This extravagance to the inexhaustible magic is enough to raise the level of the opposite team to two levels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the numerous national wars he has participated in, he has never seen such a squandering magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the head of the city, Philun, Fermi and Xiyou were stunned, and Zhang’s mouth could not be closed for a long time. Flowing sand and Iowa wave every time, there will always be a large piece of sacred glory, it seems that the power is never exhausted, and the same magic, regardless of the extent of the addition or scope of action, far beyond their peers. Only Clark looks a bit normal, but that is also compared to the sand. If you compare these priests with Philen, you don’t know how far they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry on both sides looked at the array of Richard, but the team of Richard had changed shape during the high-speed march, revealing that it was originally in the center of the square. The heavy-duty infantry formed a sturdy line of defense against the enemy on one side and the fragile rib to the enemy on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Cavalry General suddenly felt a little bad, but it was too late to make another order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange howling in the air, which filled the eardrums in an instant, and even overwhelmed the thunderous horseshoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ash-splitting venomous bone blade flew out neatly, attacking the cavalry from the ribs. Flutter! After a dull scream, the Pioneer’s hundred rides all fell, one left! The rigorous front of the stormtroopers immediately appeared a thorny gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up cavalrymen could hardly believe their eyes, and they were subconsciously pulling their horses. The horses were long and the front hooves rose high. The rear cavalry are still rushing at high speed. In order to avoid the front comrades, they have to forcibly turn, so the formation of the cavalry is suddenly chaotic. Although there is no large-scale collision and trampling, local commotion is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more poisonous bone blades appeared in the sky, forming two black clouds, almost connected together. The distribution of the bone edges in the dark clouds is evenly terrible, so the lethality is evenly distributed in the coverage of the black clouds. In other words, every corner of the black cloud is a deadly area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three rounds of bones in the past, the right side of the cavalry has only seven hundred rides left, the foremost, and the most elite three hundred cavalry have fallen . The storm-like blow finally made the empire's proud cavalry shocked, and the morale instantly fell to the bottom. In the face of two hundred singular throwing soldiers, the remaining cavalry squadrons slanted and slanted from the enemy and rushed to the Eagles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry on the left has slammed into the heavy shield of the humanoid warrior! In the face of heavy infantry with blessings, these cavalry only slammed the opponent's front line slightly into the inside, and they could not enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front row of knights flew out of the battle and fell into Richard's front. The only ending of these cavalry is death. This group of knights was not a full-loaded knight who was born specifically for the rushing, but it was not a good result for the high-end heavy infantry armed with teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, both sides entered a state of entanglement, but the situation once again made the Imperial General stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole hundred humanoid warriors suddenly flashed out of the battle, slammed into the stalled cavalry, and then the sword fell in the hand, and immediately splashed a piece of blood in front of them. wave! They slammed into the shield and crashed. When the sword fell, a row of cavalry screamed and fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swords in the hands of these humanoid warriors are all shining with magical light, sharp and unparalleled, and a sword goes down, the lock of the cavalry suddenly cut like a cream. The flesh and blood of the armor is not even a glimpse. Even if the cavalry are blocked by weapons, in addition to the heaviest heavy weapons, the other will be all two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are enchanted weapons?!" The Imperial General screamed out! His eyesight is excellent, and he can see that the humanoid warriors are not only possessing enchanted weapons, but the quality is not even worse than his sabre! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These humanoid warriors are up to nine levels. In the face of five-level opponents, they have an overwhelming advantage. Now there are also magical blessings and equipment. It is unbelievable to be luxurious. In the end, the Imperial Cavalry was as easy to cut as cheese in front of the humanoid warrior armed with teeth. The hundred enchanted swords that Richard has retained have finally played their due role at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword and the ** are colliding, the blood is shooting, the minced meat and the stump are flying. However, this is only the beginning, because the feast of magic has just begun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of Richard’s hands is constantly waving, and the fire wall is ignited in the Imperial Cavalry. The magical fire of the raging once cooked the fearless orcs, not at all. The cavalry can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from a high altitude, you can see that these walls of fire just form a circle, just surrounding Richard’s troops. When the Imperial Knight wants to attack Richard's square, he needs to go through the sea of ​​fire first, and then he will fight against the humanoid warriors of the complete incarnation war machine under the flames of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of many Imperial Cavalry is to simply jump to the middle of Richard’s forces, and the melee is better than being burned to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the two fireballs coming from afar, the magician of the Iron Triangle Empire finally shot. One fireball broke out in the middle of Richard's troops, and the other fireball was not ignorant of the way Iya used to deflect the direction. It exploded in the middle of the Imperial Cavalry and ignited several cavalry. The fireballs that are blown up in the crowds are completely resistant to the warriors who are almost resistant to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
