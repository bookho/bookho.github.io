			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has fixed his mind and only read the material carefully from the beginning, only to find out It is not a brand new seed, sharing the soul with the mother nest, but it also needs to absorb nutrients and divine growth, and the ability to create combat units is only two-thirds of the maternal body. Its biggest advantage is that it can be placed in other planes, even if it is only two-thirds of the maternal body, it is also a great weapon for the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the ‘a little price’ mentioned in the mother’s nest is actually only 10,000 magic crystals and five hundred units of divinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard directly ignored this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing to be happy about is that the nest will arrive at the seventh order. When Richard returns to Faro again, it is estimated that he will be successful again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After processing the mother's nest, Richard greeted Gangd in consciousness. A moment later, a mountain-like figure rushed into Richard's residence, and gave him a bear hug, and almost let Richard go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it hard to break free from the bears of Gangde, and look up and down the big man who cast this steel, laughing with a fist on his chest and saying: "When I was away, did you have any trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the rabbits of the Iron Triangle empire slammed a few times! These guys are fine. I always want to put my claws on our business road. Of course, Laozi can't be polite with them! When they come once, I will play with them once. They cut more than 3,000 people before and after, and we have a casualty of about 5,000." De said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind, Richard counted the number of humanoid knights and found that there were only more than one hundred and two hundred, more than one hundred more than the expected damage. Frowning said: "This kind of casualty seems to be playing very hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was embarrassed to scratch his head and said: "I have tried my best. I used to fight with you for the first time, always trying to imitate you, but how to achieve the same result. And the number of rabbits in the Iron Triangle Empire is always a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, who is their commander?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A guy named Wei Lun came up the most, and Saranwell came over once. I was surrounded by him accidentally, his grandmother It’s really hard to play, and the brothers who died in the war are mostly dead there. But this old boy finally let me fight back, oh! Who said that the rabbits in the iron triangle are not afraid of death?” De angrily said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and said: "All of Saranwell was beaten back by you? How many times is his strength?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twice less than."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how did you run him?" asked Li. If the strength is one-on-two, and there is no parent-child unit on hand, Richard would not dare to say that he could defeat Saranwell in a positive confrontation. The secrets of Richard’s battlefield are actually two. One is the super-strength of the mother-wing arms, and the other is that the mother’s nest and followers can be commanded as an arm. The second article is not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde snorted and said: "The old boy dared to play handsome when he was fighting. He stood on the roof of the car as he used to, and he was more conspicuous. So I don’t care so much, bring a team of knights. Just killing him in the direction of him! Don’t cut the old boy, Laozi is not ready to come back alive! The rabbit scorpion of the Iron Triangle Empire is not hit, only after a few punches, they penetrate their formation, then The old boy saw the situation is not good, and he ran straight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished listening, half a day, and finally patted Gangde’s shoulder and sighed: When you meet you, it is also unfortunate. "This is simply killing the enemy one thousand self-destruction of the hundred hundred tactics. Saranwell obviously has not done the same thing with Gangde, even if the result of the bloody battle is 80%. It was destroyed, but Salenwell did not dare to gamble on the final luck. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, Richard and Saranwell were in a bloody battle in Oasis City. As a result, after Richard left Faro, Salenwell again Was defeated by Gangde with quite unreasonable tactics. The empire of the Iron Triangle Empire does have a lot of talents, but it seems that luck is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the time and said: "Gangde, to recruit a full cavalry, about two thousand people. Since I am back, we simply Go to the Iron Triangle Empire and take a turn and learn from them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes lit up and shouted loudly, then asked, "Did you go now?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Which is so fast! Don't worry, prepare enough. We will start again the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Gangde went to the military camp together, and he had to see for himself what his army is like now. Just walking halfway, I saw Iraq and Russia rushing in. The battle god officer's light is much darker than before, but it has become more stable and heavy, and his body is faintly smothered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped and looked up and down Io, and said with some surprise: "I have to break through again? Fast enough!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle priest did not pay attention to Richard, his eyes crossed him directly, and fell on the sand, smiling and said: "You are finally back!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha sighed and felt that something was going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Richard took a step and inserted it between Iowo and quicksand and said, "When can she come back, now I have the final say! How? Like, the fifteenth-level grand priest, let's find a place to cut the sacred fighting technique?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy to accompany!" Io immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat priest seems to have completely forgotten the original purpose of rushing, and first walked to an empty barracks next to him. Looking at the back of the fighting priest, Liu Sha always felt that he had a taste of conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the battle of the priest into the barracks, and his smile also had a hint of conspiracy. Originally, Richard's understanding of the sacred fighting technique was far less than that of Io, but now it is different. Richard’s second consciousness has been inferior to the sacred fighting techniques all the time. After such a long period of time, it has gradually merged and merged with it. After learning and combining with the experience of the field, Richard believes that it will definitely give Iraq a big Surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the barracks was heavily closed, and both the sand and Gangde were stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door closed, there was a sudden exclamation from Io, followed by a series of ping-pong and heavy objects, and the entire barracks trembled. After that, the world returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed open and Richard came out from inside. In the future, the sect of the sacred sorcerer is ruined at the moment, his face is bruised, and one eye is swollen and completely inseparable. Seeing the sand and Gangde, Richard grinned. However, his mouth was also high and swollen, so the smile touched the wound, and the pain was so cold that the smile became distorted and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Iowa did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde immediately called: "Head! What about the kid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a smile, he pointed his finger at the back and said, “It’s faint inside!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is gnashing, and several consecutive healings are thrown on Richard, right These skin injuries are really wasteful. Richard smiled very proudly and pointed it to the room and said, "There is still a guy there, give him a treatment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not give! This guy can play so, let him treat himself!" Flowing sand anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha laughed, smashed through the sand, regardless of Gangde, and took a kiss on her lips. However, the bruises on Li’s mouth have not disappeared, and the result of being too hard is to breathe in the next moment. As a result, the drifting sand is both annoyance and heartache. The magical technique throws several pieces on Richard's body as well as the divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After such an episode, Richard could not go to the military camp immediately. Even if there is a magical effect, the injury still needs a little time to recover, and the bruised look of the wolf is not good in front of the army. In his heart, Richard said to Gangde: "You are going to prepare, I need to take a break!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde smiled and couldn’t speak Weird, laughing and sanding, shy and angry, looking at the face, scared him to turn around immediately. When Gangde left, the sand was discovered, and it seemed that there was only her and Richard on the scene. This is very bad. Sure enough, Richard directly hugged her up, regardless of her struggles and protests, she found her own residence, and then kicked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, a roaring barracks suddenly sounded the roar of Iowo: "Richard! You are a mean and shameless guy!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard leaned back on the floor, spread into a large shape, and gasped. He now feels much harder than the fight with Iraq and Russia. The sand was squatting beside Richard, gently licking his chest with his fingers and snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the official fighting techniques, or the highest level of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand lazily asked: "How did you knock down Iraq and Russia? It is much faster than I thought!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy feels that his fighting skills are much more powerful than me, so he rushed up at the beginning to get a quick fix..." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then he was stunned by me!" Smile is innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand was shocked and said, "What? He was knocked down when he came up? Then later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Later... um, I just charged some interest." Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
