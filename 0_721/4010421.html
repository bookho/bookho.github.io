Io answered, while secretly Raised the vigilance against Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the body of the day is placed in a metal long plaque, escorted by the four costume knights to the top of the temple, star Already suspended and waiting there, the star swallowed the metal long scorpion, and then let the four knights climb onto their bodies, then slowly lifted off, gracefully turned around in the air, and quickly went to The speed of the star can only fly from the northern end of Shulan to the south end, and then return the body to Noland, and then transfer the Faro by Noland. The real order is to give the star, as long as When it comes to Faro, the star will hand over the body to the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is very fast, no matter what state it is in day by day, Richard is not prepared to leave any chance for her, as for those seriously injured in rest In the field, Richard was only the first to be guarded by the guards. After he had finished dealing with the holy city, he could see if he could surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other separation areas in the Shenen District are enclosed behind metal doors. These metal doors are one meter thick, as seen from the isolated doors of the first two areas. And both sides are covered with mysterious lines. Richard raises his hand and fires a fireball, bombarding it on the isolation door. This is a fireball that has specially improved its power, but the fire waves spread along those lines and spread throughout the isolation door. In this way, the power of the fireball technique is scattered to the surface of the entire isolation door, and it does not cause any damage to the isolation door. Richard's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, raising a hand and a lightning bolt on the isolation door. This time it is hitting The corner of the door, but the result is that the power of lightning is instantly dispersed, and the entire isolation door is covered with electric sparks. Of course, the seven-level lightning does not cause any damage to the isolation door. Therefore, it is the nine-level magic. It may not be able to shake the isolation door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tiramisu." Li cried back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at me." The ogre replied, and he strode forward and ran to the front of the isolation door, his body flashing red, epic The level warhammer is heavily attached to the isolation door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only listening to a loud bang, Tiramisu’s giant hammer slammed back and almost smashed into himself, and the huge sound made the strength weaker. The people in front of the eyes were almost black and vomited, and the ogre himself stepped back a few big steps. Both of them had blood overflowing. The hammer of the giant hammer in his hand was obviously bent, and the hammers constantly burst out of various magical sparks. This epic hammer is actually destroyed like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu was dizzy and shocked. He shook his two heads hard, and couldn’t help but sit down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Tiramisu’s full blow. The power of the single is close to the legendary strongman’s shot. Richard’s gaze immediately falls on the isolation door. However, it was found that there was only one bowl-shaped pit on the facade, and the entire door showed no signs of deformation. The isolation of the door was sturdy and thus imaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu has struggled to stand up at this time, the ogre eyes are red, looked at the damaged hammer, and immediately angrily Roaring, reaching out and grabbing a warhammer from a nearby knight, he wanted to rush to the isolation door again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Richard drank the tiramisu, who had already red eyes, and said, "Let's put it here first, and have a chance to say it later." We are now going to the underground energy zone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu angered: "Hey, give me a few more chances, I don't believe it can't be removed. This ghost thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "I just want to see how strong this thing is, if you dare to open the door, then the whole The temple may fly to the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre was shocked and scratched his head and said, "There is such a powerful, what is that magic? Array, how have I never heard of such a terrible magical array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe some kind of crystal explosion, who knows." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, this place is eccentric everywhere, even a door is hard to this extent, and most of the guys who made this place are even more powerful. Means." The ogre muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha actually knows this exactly, and the Three Gods do have some concealment, but Naiyou has found what they need from their memories. The Shulan people learned from the deciphered words that if there is no correct method, but violently cracking into the closed area of ​​the temple, it is possible to trigger the self-destruction device of the entire temple. Sturdy, the Shulans can't imagine what kind of power can destroy the entire temple, even the legendary magic can't do this, but since this passage is left by the builders of the temple, and still The extremely eye-catching warning fonts are printed throughout the shrine, so it is certainly not an empty intimidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard and the followers left the Shennen District, they suddenly came out of the metal wall, and it was a day-to-day, but she was just a vain shadow, and she almost looked at it. Unclear, the edge of the soul is still continually resounding. She looks at the direction in which Li and others are leaving. The face is full of resentment, but she does not dare to follow Richard. The scream has already smashed her, and almost let her annihilate her soul. As long as there is a place where she is quiet, she will never dare to approach her in the state of her soul. If she is discovered by Naiyou, she will definitely become a nephew. Quiet playthings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking day by day, going backwards and not entering the metal wall, there is a left-behind knight in the distance, but it is not Discover her movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Licha group went down the spiral ladder to the lower hall, and then a narrow passage of the apse down all the way through a half-open The gate came to a semi-empty platform, including Richard. Everyone was shocked by the sights. This is a completely unimaginable hall. There is a huge and far-reaching space. Without the pressure, the whole hall has no Sulawian style attached. It is all its original style. The mechanical arm hanging from the dome is still inserted in the round table, and it is still rotating slowly. The light in the hall is dim. A few bright red lights that are constantly flashing, there is only a little red light in the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are metal, pipelines and huge machinery everywhere, and for a time, Richard and others have forgotten where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step forward and found that the platform that was out to midair was actually closed, separated from the energy hall by a transparent thing. The railings on the platform have the same eye-catching warning signs that remind people not to try to break this transparent barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see this underground energy hall, even the most unruly followers are stunned. This is an image that they can’t understand at all. But you can deeply feel the greatness and glory of the race that created this hall. It is just such a powerful race. Where is it now, why did they create these miraculous halls and abandon it here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped the transparent barrier in front of his eyes, with a few tiny lightning bolts on his fingertips. These lightnings climbed over the barrier and had no effect. The magical resistance of these transparent barriers is even stronger than the isolation door, completely to the point of magic immunity, and the warning text left on this platform is slightly different from other places, according to the estimates of the Shulan people. Perhaps a higher level of warning means that once this barrier is destroyed by brute force, it is likely to trigger a more powerful disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
