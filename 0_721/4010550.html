The arrow pointed at Richard and said: “External, you can try to resist.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Melin to stop, Richard sneered: "Do you dare to shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter Captain I couldn’t hold it anymore, and the hand that controlled the string was loose. The long arrow slammed out of the string and went straight to Richard’s shoulder. Although the shoulder was not deadly, the long arrow of the guardian elf was huge. It is seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is also very surprised that the hunter captain actually puts the arrow, it seems that he must leave himself, and Richard’s chest suddenly burst into violent turmoil. There was a three-sided electric shield that fluttered around, and then one side of the body had already passed the arrow, and one step had already reached the hunter captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter captain instinctively reached for the short sword, while the crossbow blocked Richard, but his movements were only half, and the Richard in front suddenly became blurred. And then slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The afterimage,." The hunter captain’s heart just floated on the idea, and suddenly there was a strong force behind him, and the whole person flew off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the long hair of the hunter captain and rushed at full speed. In an instant, he rushed under a big tree dozens of meters away, screaming and grabbing The head of the hunter captain went to the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the hunter, the hunter’s captain’s head half of the head fell into the trunk, and the blood immediately flowed down, and Richard turned back and popped several dark colored balls. For the fear of the aura, a group of hunters who have not yet reacted to blast, and several consecutive fear attacks, the Elf hunters resisted the first, and can not resist the second wave, the latter three waves of fear are completely Wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard snorted, and the ability of the Aoba hunter to resist fear was far beyond his expectation, indicating that the hunter’s will was not firm. Richard stopped paying attention to the elf hunters who screamed everywhere. Two steps to the side of Mei Lin, a woman who was still holding the forest in the daze, dragged her to the depths of Lin Hai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing out for several kilometers, Melin found the opportunity to call it up: "Hey, you, what are you doing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard did not slow down, and he ran and said, "Escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline struggled: "Why do you want to escape?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman of the forest is struggling with strength, but Richard has added a force in his hand and can still drag her to run, saying: "We Don't escape, don't stay and talk to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course, but it was before the Aoba Elf put the arrow, now I am not in the mood to reason with them, and these guys obviously have no reason to speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Minline struggled again: "Wait a minute, Aoba is very important. This misunderstanding needs to be explained. This is the only possible ally of our Yongyao tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Yes . "Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is speechless, what happened at the Presbyterian Church is still vivid, which is what the allies did, and ran for a few kilometers, Melin suddenly realized Come, I have been dragged and run by Richard. The struggles in the middle are all ineffective. The power of Richard seems to be endless. She was shocked. As a daughter of the forest, Mei Lin is in all aspects of Lin Hai. The ability will be enhanced, and Richard is Druid, she is a hunter after all, how much power is better than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Richard, Melin felt that Richard seemed to be a fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is actually simple. Richard was originally a physique, and the magical armed forces gave him the sacredness of his sanctuary level. In addition, he mastered some rules. The ability of Richard to gain in Lin Hai is far above Mei Lin. Several advantages are superimposed. What the daughter of the forest is naturally a drag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men ran forward for a while, and Richard broke the silence and said: "Aoba has made a similar request to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know." Mei Lin produced a sentence, she knew that she had left her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "This is not difficult to guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melin sigh He said, "It’s all for the blood of our everlasting tribe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of ignorant guys thought they could get it this way. Everlasting blood." Richard commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline glimpsed and asked, "Can't you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not entirely impossible , but the chances are very low. If you want to get out of the forest, you won't increase your chances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin looked at Richard doubtfully and asked: " How do you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guess." Richard intends to perfuse the past, so he opened the topic: "Why do tribes value the son of the forest so much, except you There is no other special point in the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin hesitated and said, "This is the promotion of the tree of life, the forest. The son of the forest means the favor of the forest and the world tree. The more the number of children in a tribe's forest, the less the number of natural enemies that the tree of life encounters in the promotion, and the number of our guardian elves does not grow fast, so life The reduction of the natural enemies of the tree is the key to the success of the promotion. When the tree of life enters the late stage of maturity, the guardian elves must have at least The son of a forest, the tree of life is likely to become a complete body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and stopped, saying: "This way, I understand, We seem to have got rid of the chase, we can take a break..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Licha just fell, and Melin suddenly stood up and shouted: "The people of the Aoba tribe are chasing, and there are Fenglu, I can feel their breath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face changed, saying: “Yes Come kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melin smiled and shook her head and said, "No, it must be chasing me. Aoba is no longer scrupulous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we fled "When finished, not waiting for Melin to agree, Richard chose a direction, rushed into the forest, and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Melin stunned and chose a different direction and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few kilometers away, Feng Lu was on the ground, looked at the traces, and felt the smell of the wind, pointing to the direction of Mei Lin’s escape, saying "She is in this direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a vague sense between the sons of the forest, and the presence of each other can be felt within a certain distance, so the maple dew is After chasing Mei Lin’s best choice, there are two elders of the Aoba tribe behind him. One of them said, “What about the outsider?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feng Lukou said: "No matter who he is, it is very important to catch Meilin. It is still very easy to catch an outsider in Linhai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s voice rang behind them: “Don’t catch, I’m not here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were shocked, but when they looked back, they only saw A very dazzling glare, the three people flashed in front of each other, and nothing could be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind, this is magic, not Druid's natural spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maple dew instantly stimulated the natural protection and removed all the unfavorable effects of the body, but after restoring sight, what was seen was a sprinkled piece of oil Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maple scorpion, the ironwood wand in his hand waved like a wind, desperately blocking the knives of Richard’s tidal water, but his body was still brought out. A few small wounds, but the reason he was able to withstand a wave of attacks was that Richard was circling around the three people, and the elf knife in his hand slashed them like a squally shower, killing three green leaves at one time. The elders are in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are all sanctuary standards, with three-to-one, and they have survived a round of attack by Richard, and Feng Lu roared: "outsiders, blue The leaf tribe will never let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound, Fenglu seized an opportunity and suddenly turned into a forest violent giant bear, howling When the person stood up and raised the small palm of the car, he took it to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
