For example, this sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard reached out and caught the long sword thrown, as opposed to At the age, his movements can be called quite agile. The long sword is in the hand, and the old master looks at it carefully. The unpleasantness caused by the attitude of Richard is suddenly swept away. He carefully touched Jianfeng with his hands, and the blazing color in his eyes became thicker and thicker. This long sword was one of the enchanted swords that Richard brought with him, and he gave him a hand. In the eyes of Kalimi, the long sword in the hand from the material to the caster, and even the enchantment of the craft, are all on the top. Moreover, the engraved patterns are simple and generous, full of sturdy momentum, and are not the taste that ordinary craftsmen can possess. Only the great magician with profound knowledge and artistic attainment will produce such a work under his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it, his mouth hangs with a touch of sarcasm. Noland's magical civilization is far ahead of Faro, and Richard has obtained the royal sword of the royal family. He is placed in Faro, and he is the master of the masterpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master finally gave a long breath and said: "This magic sword is of excellent quality. If it is sold to the Masters Association, we will... The price of a gold coin is acquired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" Although Richard had a hunch, Kalimi’s greed still exceeded his imagination. If this magic sword is made in Faro, the cost of two thousand gold coins is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalimi seems to feel too overwhelmed and said: "Don’t worry, I haven’t finished it yet! As compensation for your contribution, you will become A distinguished silver robe mage of the Masters Association. In the entire Masters Association, the status of the silver robe mage is also very noble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Richard’s face finally Disappeared, coldly asked: "I really can't think of who gave you the right to run on my site to collect my taxes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle-aged Master stood up and said loudly: "Richard! Don't forget that you are also a mage. As long as you are a mage, you must obey the command of the Masters Association! Do you want to defy the command of the Masters Association?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his beard on his chin and said with a sneer: "Order? If I say no?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged Master’s face suddenly cooled down, and sullenly said: “Then you are a sinner! Let’s take a trip with us. The elders of the Masters Association will decide your charges!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage Association?" Richard suddenly felt that he did not know what to say, in order to fully express his ridicule. In the end, he only said such a sentence: "You These greedy, stupid and crazy guys want me to obey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence is exported, Richard is also deeply aware of its hollowness. The inheritance of dark blue in magic is profound and profound, and it will be a hundred thousand miles in the monks. Even Luofu has turned his eyes straight. Hem is a look that hates iron and steel. If it is not the shadow that Richard has left for him. Really strong, he wants to be alone in the shirt, and the opposite Master. The loud reputation of the unicorn Viscount is not just by getting in bed with a woman. Leading, killing, and screaming, he feels that he can do everything now. Although sensible tells Viscount Heim, it is best not to fall out of such a big thing as the Masters Association, but the Viscount has never been a species of intellectual action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head! It’s useless to deal with these guys!" Viscount Hem was very euphemistic. He can't be stupid enough to tell Richard that you are not the opponent of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mage jumped up and his fingers quickly poked at Richard’s nose and screamed: “Do you dare to insult the Masters Association?! You want to be with the kingdom. Are the three noble masters right? Now, I declare in the name of the Masters Association that all your enchanted weapons are being levied. And you, yourself, will be pierced by the magical veins, imprisoned magic, and you must not use magic for life! Come! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors in the house screamed and pulled out the sword and pointed at Richard. The silver robe mages also stood up and were always ready to go. Luo Fu snorted heavily, and the faint temperament of his body showed his power as a sanctuary. In this way, the people of the Masters Association did not dare to do it at the moment, but the silver robe mage stared at Luo Fu's eyes were not good. Obviously, a sanctuary can’t scare them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard thoughtfully, stroking the short beard, he suddenly said to Felimi: "Your teacher, you know why I am standing here, etc. Are you ten minutes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falmi’s body sat up straight, the turbid gaze became sharp, and he snorted, waiting for Richard’s Below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not speak, but suddenly waved his left fist and punched the face of a middle-aged mage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a squeaky bone in the room, the middle-aged mage flew out like a rag doll, and the blood squirted from the completely collapsed nose. Come out and leave a bunch of shiny blood beads in the air. The middle-aged mage was like a savage superintendent, and his body flew a few meters, hitting the wall heavily, and then slowly slipped to the ground. He was piled on the ground like a rag pocket, and he had already been unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the Master of Noland’s stunned for such a punch, and the Faro’s mage doesn’t need to say anything. Kalimi has a high weight and a strong magic, but he has not been on the battlefield for more than a decade, and his reaction has been several times slower than his youth. So that Richard took a punch and he reacted after half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fist hits the middle-aged mage, Richard’s knuckles are still squeaky, slowly recovering his fists, and he breathes a sigh of relief, saying: This is much more painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalimi stared at Richard, the rest of the silver robe mage was like a sculpture, and could not believe himself for a time. s eyes. Richard gave the answer to his question: "Actually, the reason I just waited for you for ten minutes was just to wait for the soldiers under my command to come over. Come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of Richard, the wooden partition wall was suddenly opened by several large holes from the outside, one by one wrapped in the heavy armor, and the person holding the shield holding the axe poured into the room. They smashed the axe and immediately knocked down the warriors of the Masters Association and controlled the scene. The heavy armored samurai did not have any preferential treatment for the silver robe mage. The heavy shield swept the face and immediately took the spells with various accents back to the mage of the mage, but pressed the dizzy mage masters On the ground, the neck is covered with a sharp axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalimi, who only has a golden robe, is safe and sound, because he is self-confident, has been sitting, not doing it. Falimi is old, but not confused, he is also very clear that once he moves, it must be the end of the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master’s face changed a bit, suddenly stood up, pointed to Richard, said gloomyly: “There is never a person who is an enemy of the Master Association. Have a good end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
