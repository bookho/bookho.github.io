			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top third floor of the deep blue is the exclusive area of ​​Su Helun ,employees only. If you want to enter, the magic wandering between the layers has the equivalent of a fifteenth-level warrior, and they will attack all invaders that are not recorded in the magic core. As long as you can win these battles, challenge a dozen magician, and finally knock down Su Hailun, you can arbitrarily rob the legendary Master's nest. At least in theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage is a person who likes the sense of space, so she has a huge space. At this point in the corner of the exclusive area, echoing the intermittent screams. In the gloomy and long corridors, the screams reverberate, leaving the uninformed people creepy. The informed minority is completely another reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini appeared from the end of the corridor and walked quickly. After all, she was still a girl, her rushing pace, her tight lips, her slightly eyebrows, and her slightly tight body seemed to be ready to dodge, and she did not like the darkness of the corridor. However, this area is based on the theme of darkness, gloom, and dampness. It is always the right decision of His Highness Su Hailun, so no one dares to raise an objection. At this time, a vague scream was heard again in the corridor. Minnie recognized the voice, and a sneer appeared at the mouth and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the dark area, there is a prison area of ​​more than ten large and small prisons with different functions. In the center of a cell, Randolph was lifted high on the armor and the clothes were stripped. A prisoner on the upper body was waving a five-meter-long whip and took a look at Randolph. On the body. The jailer is a black man. The muscles of the knot are covered with grease, reflecting the tired light. The corners of the leather shorts are worn out. The top is also stained with large dark brown stains. I don't know who or what creature's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can ignore the violence and bloody observations in front of you, you will find that the jailer is extraordinary, the long whip shakes the complex trajectory in the air, creaks, and then takes The horror of the whistling wind fell on Randolph's white buttocks, leaving a reddish scar on the slap of the two sides. The bruises are high and swollen, but they are not broken, so that they will not be hurt too much, and they can double the pain. The jailer stood four meters away, waving a five-meter long whip. The whip marks left by the whip on Randolph's white buttocks were evenly distributed, almost filled with empty space that could be filled in, but occasionally there were streaks. But it is not broken. From a distance, it seems to be a Fauvist abstract painting, filled with countless messy color blocks and lines, but showing an indescribable beauty. This skill is already in full swing. If the jailer is put outside, he can be regarded as a strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randolph’s ass has been swollen, tears on his face, nose and saliva, and handsome faces twisted and twisted. As an outstanding child of an ancient aristocratic family, Randolph is also not lacking in courage and patience. However, there are many penalties in the dark areas for the purgatory demon, the abyss devil, the various dragon-like subspecies, and the mixed-race orc, the polar gray dwarves and other powerful ethnic preparations, humans, especially the magicians who are not strong in strength. For these penalized masters, it is simply a bowl of white water, and there is no smell in drinking. For example, the jailer who slammed Randolph, using only the simplest whipping, has already caused his will to collapse. It is important to know that the cell that hangs Randolph is large in size, with a total of 16 sets of instruments in the possession, and the jailer can skillfully use nine of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the whiplash, Randolph’s convulsions did not stop, and even the coma could not be done in the past. The violent pain hits, there is no peak and trough, there is no pause for a moment, and the impact of the rational dam along the edge, as if the next moment will go to the despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wounds were concentrated on the butt that Minnie had reminded him to focus on, so the huge humiliation almost made Randolph go crazy, but fortunately he was also a strong-willed person, until the end did not completely collapse. However, when the whipping was over, he had no strength to feel shame again. In the process of torture, things that even made him embarrassed happened. He only hopes that this matter will not be passed on. If he reaches Su Hailun's ear, his apprentice position will not be guaranteed. At the thought of being kicked out of the dark blue life, Randolph suddenly felt a deep chill, and he didn't even dare to imagine what to do in the future. From the high to the top, the drop is not something that everyone can afford. Now, Randolph finally discovered that what makes him different is not his appearance or talent, but the title of Su Hailun disciple and his family background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, fear and confession swallowed Randolph’s heart and made him even forget to curse Minnie’s ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Su Hailun’s favorite lounge, a black skin slave more than 2 meters tall is bowing his body with a huge golden round bowl on his back. It is full of all kinds of fresh and rare fruits, some of which are rich and full of luster of attractive entrances, others are strange and strange colors, all kinds of forests, many are not produced this season, there are many The product of the ectopic surface. In the top of the crystal cup, there are a few treasures that are usually guarded by super-order Warcraft. I am afraid that there are dozens of kilograms of this large pot of fruit. It is Su Hailun’s snack today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black skin slaves took a heavy step, walked along the gravel-paved path, and then passed through a beautiful foliage of trees, and then through the vast On the lawn, I saw a few tables and chairs placed beside the small lake. Compared with the eye-catching fruits and containers, the furniture is simple in line, and the decoration is pure color, unpretentious, but at first glance, people can immediately feel a sense of comfort and relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen is leaning on the soft couch lazily, throwing fruit into his mouth. There is a same golden fruit bowl next to it, and it has already bottomed out. The black slave put the fruit bowl down, took the old one, and returned along the original road. It is said to be a leisure hall, but the area of ​​this area is more than one thousand square meters, which is equipped with a complete ecological and heating system, just like being in the most comfortable mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five or six great magisters are surrounding the soft couch of Su Helun and report on important events since this time. According to the division of importance from high to low, recent events are mainly financial balance, Randolph and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great magister describes the income and expenditure of the entire dark blue in winter in a simple and fast language. Before he finished, one is being thrown to Su Helun The huge cherries of the small mouth suddenly stopped in the air, and then the eyes of Su Helun’s bright and unparalleled eyes were fixed on the body of the big magister, and the power of the dragon was cast out instantly, so that all the great magisters present were present. Some are not standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you say? We lost money last season?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This financial The big magician's race is very different. It is actually the deadly enemy of mankind: the polar gray dwarf. There are very few magical talents in the gray dwarf, and there are only a handful of people who can cultivate to the level of the big magician. However, the gray dwarfs are rich in money and fine nature, which is suitable for the management of accounts. He immediately bowed his head in a slightly squatting posture, avoiding the direct vision of the legendary mage, and carefully replied: "Yes! But the loss is not large, less than 600,000 imperial gold coins...."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun immediately interrupted him: "That is also a loss! I remember that I just robbed a few dragons in the middle of last year, and I still have some harvest into the dark blue operation. In the middle. How can I lose money? Did you find out why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason has been found, but..." The Grey Dwarf Magister has some vomiting and swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say!" Su Hailun's voice increased again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf gnawed his teeth and said, "The reason is that you have been in a good mood for a while..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherry continues its flight and disappears into the depths of Su Hailun's mouth. The legendary mage wrinkled a nice little eyebrow and looked thoughtfully. After a while, he slowly said: "But for some time, my mood may be better. This is first released, said the latter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another human magician immediately took a step and said: "I have already given Randolph punishment according to your instructions. Now you should see how it should be. Disposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your suggestion?" Su Hailun lazily played with a water splash in his hand, some of which were of little interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human sorcerer said: "His talent is still quite good, the overall rating is excellent, and he is the son of the Duke of Solam, the sacred priest, Crewe Master Si has also confirmed his talent as a builder, so my suggestion is to retain his apprenticeship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage snorted and said: That Cruise is also very self-proclaimed to be a master? And he actually added a prefix to the name of his own name! Leave it alone, this old guy sees when the person is allowed! We already have a future structure Installed, this kind of thing that can't be kept up, no need to cultivate, waste resources! We lost a lot of money in the last season! In this case, according to the original decision, send Randolph back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is the son of the Duke of Soram after all..." The human magician carefully reminded him. Even in the sacred dynasty of the strong, the Duke of Soram is also a big and important figure. The Duke himself also has three prominent titles, including the Dragon Slayer, the Troll Terminator and the Purgatory Hunter. It is only a step away from the legend and can enter the legendary realm at any time. If the two sides really turn hostile, the Duke of Soram will not lose to Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun waved his hand impatiently and interrupted him, saying: "Randolph is the son of Soram, but Soram is not the only one. Son! And in addition to Randolph's mother, Soram's remaining eleven wives will be on our side! So, I remember that Soram's son has two talents, not too much. I am embarrassed. I will give this self-funded apprenticeship priority to them. As long as Soram takes half of the original sponsorship fee, he can get the quota."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "With this sponsorship fee, Deep Blue will not lose money?" Su Hailun turned to the gray dwarf, his face is full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf quickly calculated it, frowning said: "Only to guarantee the spring. Because your next mood will definitely get better and better."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is serious this time, the small hand is caught in the fruit bowl, but he forgot to throw it into his mouth. She was indulging, tangled, and finally said with some pain: "My mood... This... I can't control it. What should I do now? The dragons are already very poor. I have just visited them one by one last year. Now go again. There is definitely nothing to gain. And the more they move farther and farther, the harder it is to find one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to add another self-funded apprenticeship? The gray dwarf tried to suggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
