			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the course is still a philosophy of magic, the difference is that the lecturer is Riley, the 17th-level magician is also 'a guy in this magic tower'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riley is tall and thin, wearing fine gold silk magic glasses, all over the body are meticulously meticulous, savvy eyes seem to be able to see through the world. When he stood on the podium, the classroom was still silent. The 17th-level great magician is not far from the magician. Maybe the golden level is never possible, maybe it is a night. Compared with the 16th-level magician, the extra eight-level magic spell position can make the battle result between the two irreversible. The relationship between the three eight-level magic and the two eight-level magic can be calculated by the ten-year-old child. There is no statistical difference in the spell level between the seven levels and the following levels of magic. Although the advantage of the magic below seven is not big, but it is also an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Riley first arrived at the 17th level, his demeanor became perfect on certain things, and he would never care. The living conditions of the prairie hamsters no longer hang the Kamchatka wild boar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When standing in the center of the podium, Riley’s feelings have always been good. At least at this time, in this enclosed space, he is supreme and controls everything. If you can't think of a woman named Su Hailun, it will be even more perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryley’s voice is soft but not slight, and it sounds at the same volume in everyone’s ear: “Everything has a foundation, just like the world’s architecture is at the origin. Above, and the planes and rules are mutually dependent. We, both humans and other races, live above the plane. Although we are weak, we are not humble. There are no two identical souls in the world, and there is no Two identical people. What is the meaning of our existence, to understand the world, to become stronger, and to obtain more resources, which is equivalent to freedom. Our world is the world dominated by the strong, our law It is the rule made by the strong. It has an indistinguishable distance from the derivative rule of the plane, but it can determine the fate of most of us. As a weak, you do not need to violate the derivative rules, as long as it violates the law, It’s enough to destroy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who attended the class mostly nodded, and some of the older mages were more touched. Compared with most of the students in the course yesterday, they were almost infused with mental energy. Today's lectures have some interactive reactions. Seeing the good response, Riley smiled a little, and said calmly: "Only the magician can feel the derivative rules, and instead of the legendary realm, it is impossible to understand the basic rules of the plane. For you and me, How many people can reach the realm of the Magister? Even if it is a genius, how many are falling in the middle? The composition of the world, the rules of the plane, I can also tell you, but this is meaningless to you. The world of magic can happen, the premise is to have powerful power. What does power come from? From the understanding of itself, the use of the environment. In fact, everyone is complex, want to fully understand themselves, It is likely to be a lifelong task. Therefore, if you want to improve your strength, you need to be down-to-earth and start from knowing yourself. From the bottom up, you can master the fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riley waved a magical image of the human body in front of him. He pointed to the various parts of the image and began to talk about the core content: "Power is not complicated, but it is not as simple as a few spells. Although three levels of magic must be stronger than two, you can't ignore other factors. In general, a person's strength can be decomposed into four major parts: attributes, equipment, skills, and blood. In fact, there is a fifth part, wisdom! This is the biggest difference between individuals, and only the part that you can grasp. I won't explain it in detail here. Then let's start with the attributes and talk about what is mental power..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This class has a huge harvest. For the first time, it is known that spiritual power is derived from the power of the soul, and magic is the source of power for magic. The martial artists mainly rely on the cultivation of ** power, while the clergymen borrow the power of faith. However, after each occupation enters the legendary stage, it is more or less the power of the rules. The size of the rules can determine the level of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the course, the handsome Riley summed up: "Don’t be greedy for unrealistic things, be down to earth, be on the road of strength. Stepping up the stairs, this is what you need to do. If you don't say anything, the promotion will bring longer life, and you will have more possibilities to pursue more powerful forces. So see yourself and understand. Environment, allocating resources, maximizing the power of the individual. The more the path of the strong is, the more important it is to take a step forward. The actual gap between the seventeenth level magician and the sixteenth level, It’s not as small as people think.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just memorized two completely opposite ways of thinking, and he has to think carefully in the future. On the three-day course, Master Phil proposed several new ways of thinking. For example, the master draws a circle in the air with a line in the middle, so the left is red and the right is blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mystery of the world is endless. And can we know all the mysteries? This is a basic point of divergence. Some people think that can, many magicians They can all fall into this category. Others think it is impossible. They often think that only the gods can do this, so believers and clergy are mostly in this category."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A line of Phil Masters is separated from the center of the circle, half to the left and right. This of course does not mean which kind of person is more. Phil means that he does not evaluate the two ways which are more correct. It is just an introduction from a neutral point of view. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After describing the inconsistency of the world or the infinite division, Phil Masters also talked about a dozen other points. Like Richard, most people don't understand very well. And their biggest doubt is, what is the use of these things? Can't grow magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one will really tell the doubts. Phil is a 18th-level magister, and it looks like he is not much different from the 17th-level great magician. Seriously, the Magister and the 17th-level Master are just a spell level that differs by a level 9 magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nine-level spell, only this.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So not only did anyone dare to question Phil, but they listened very seriously to their ears. Being able to listen to the magician's lectures, there may not be one of the ten mages who can have such luck, although the content of the lecture seems to be somewhat...unrealistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, after the face of Theodore stood on the stage, the first thing was to draw a circle like Phil Master, then in the middle A line is drawn, the only difference is the position of the line. The red that represents the unknown is almost the vast majority, and the blue becomes a thin one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world is so subtle, we can't know everything, only God can know everything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Afterwards, Richard knew that Theodore was not a mage, but a very powerful divine master, and the level was roughly equivalent to the 16th and 7th level mages. Dark blue is the world of magicians. It is strange to have a magician. It is even more strange that Theodore does not have only one kind of faith. He also believes in three gods, and the three beliefs do not interfere with each other. This allows him to issue three different systems of magical skills, far more powerful than the ordinary level of the same level. However, Richard seriously thought about it and combined the information he had seen. He found that he wanted to have three different beliefs at the same time. The only way is to deceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
