Now there are only ... more than 10,000 people. I will follow the agreement with you to go to Lanshui Oasis City. But now, I hope to take them some way. Once I meet Danger, I will take the messenger to leave first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that this is the final elegy of Saranwell in the end of the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper appears in the Northeast Gulf, and the Iron Triangle Empire can be said to be the first to bear the brunt. After the three wave attacks of the Reaper, the Iron Triangle Empire, except for some remote towns in the western border area, all the survivors, there are only more than 10,000 people in the Cold Iron Throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Triangle Empire, once populous, has fewer than 300,000 people. The emperor, the emperor of Allen, has existed in name only. Even if the reaper is finally driven out of Faro, there will be no more countries like the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire population of Faro has been cut in half, and hundreds of millions of people have become the energy and raw materials for the reaper. If it were not for the deep red kingdom of Richard and the turbulent land of the mother's nest that blocked the reaper, I am afraid that the mechanical beetle of the Reaper has already covered the entire continent, destroying all life that can be eliminated, and digging all the resources that can be excavated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the battle with Salonville was put down, and Richard received statistics on the casualties of these battles. At the forefront of the data is the casualties of the strong, Richard saw a familiar name: twilight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色 is the first special unit of the nest. She was created with the soul fragments of Sinclair, so it can always be seen as the shadow of a crazy girl with a dark past. After several times of processing and modulation by the mother nest, the strength of the twilight has also steadily increased until it enters the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the mother's nest creation, although she also has a soul, Richard always ignores her intentionally or unintentionally. Now, in retrospect, Twilight does have a lot of delicate thoughts, but unfortunately, when Richard's memory reveals these details one by one, her name has become gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight is placed on the battlefield No. 2, and there are many other strong players on the 2nd battlefield. These strong people survived because they retreated early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the twilight has not retreated, she may have seen the Reaper start to turn to Richard’s No. 1 battlefield, or because of the mother’s nest Not afraid of death. Specifically, because of what, at the moment it is no longer important, because her name has become gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the three-year-old, sand, to the current Fasqi, twilight, one by one, the name gradually faded away from Richard. Richard’s strength is getting stronger and stronger, but he is becoming more and more lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put down the casualty statistics and the list of deaths, and the heart was actually a time. Once again, he began to doubt his own battle with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now tens of thousands of people every day through the plane transmission channel to the Golden Valley and Green Forest. But from a numerical point of view, Richard is the survivor of less than 10 million people who have exchanged hundreds of thousands of the most elite fighters. From the perspective of combat power, this is undoubtedly wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro also has the mother's nest, but even if it hits now, Richard does not know whether he will win. If he can't win, he will lose his mother. nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard suddenly got up and didn’t know if he was really wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether it is right or wrong, the war will continue. Next, Richard began to refine the essence of the embers, make the structure, reorganize the line of defense, organize anti-reconnaissance of the victims, help the mother nest to develop new combat units, and so on, and every day there is nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bad news is that because the casualties in this wave of reapers are too high, the strong players began to refuse to participate in Faro's points battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving strongmen mostly withdrew from Faro, leaving the strong powers in the hands of Richard with three legends and a dozen sanctuaries. Fortunately, there are a few fifth-order structures in the point redemption system that can maintain attractiveness. Otherwise, Archimonde's war machine will really collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has long been in the expectation of Richard and the faceless, still managed to cope calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sometimes goes to a turbulent place to exchange data about the reaper with the mother's nest. Richard has completely resolved the reconnaissance volatility of the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the analysis results, the newly created combat unit of the Brood covers a new layer of thick skin. This kind of crispy thick skin has not much defense, but it can absorb the reconnaissance fluctuations of the Reaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest immediately made a number of reconnaissance beasts with new results and sent them to the area where the reaper was. This time the beasts were not discovered by the reapers, they even swaggered over the reaper's head and were not found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the flying beast successfully crossed the fog wall and saw the full picture of the Reaper base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seashore of dozens of square kilometers has all become the base of the reaper. Each of the buildings with different styles and coldness is running at full speed, constantly spitting out parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These parts are brought together in a special building under the traction of the force field. After passing through one factory, the parts become parts and then become functional components. In the end, it became a fighter and a land unit with different functions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these fighters and marine units are obviously not capable of moving, but are being towed to the sea. There is a sloping metal column on the sea. From this metal column, a little white light is constantly emitted, and it falls on the built fighters and marine units. Fighters and marine units that are shot into white light will gradually gain mobility and then go to their respective positions to wait for orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the beast saw it, Richard and the mother's nest also saw it. Li Biao raised his eyebrows and immediately knew that the embers from the metal column were embers. Through this magical substance, the Reaper's unit has the ability to fight. I just don't know how much remains of the embers in the metal mother ship in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the base of the Reaper with his eyebrows. As long as the mother ship was killed, the Reaper was doomed to failure. However, the scene that the Beast saw next made Richard immediately dismissed the thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In several squares in the base, there are densely packed fighters, and other squares are a war elephant and a spider warrior, and a few A kind of fighting machine that cannot be called out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are obviously activated by the essence of the embers. As far as these strengths are concerned, it is indeed very dangerous for Richard to be alone. If he is not careful, he will stay there forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother’s nest felt the thought of Richard and said: “Master, the best way is to slowly consume it with the reaper. As long as we continue to destroy the wreckage, they The essence of the embers that depend on survival will be less and less. One day we will win. If you attack their mother ship now, my calculation results will not exceed 20%."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed hard and nodded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the flying beast suddenly came a picture. A group of mechanical beetles were dragging the wreckage of several henry combat units to the beach. That is a few brains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These brains were not made into flesh and blood, but were sent to a special building on the beach. Seeing this special building, Richard’s mind suddenly floated an idea, which is the research institution of the Reaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the mother's nest also said: "This is the reaper's laboratory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don't know why, the sound of the mother's nest reveals some panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that it is a laboratory, it is entirely intuitive, how can the hen know, and so sure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the flying beast is fixed in that laboratory. After a while, a group of palm-sized special miniature fighters suddenly flew out of the lab. They are not armed, but they are constantly emitting bursts of special volatility and flying to the south as fast as lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They emit a signal similar to the summoned signal. When the signal is perceived by the flying beast, it is also known to both Richard and the mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of information is actually an order: "Destruction No. 013, immediately accept the mother ship order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After this order, there is also a piece of information that is difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately communicated with the ancestor’s consciousness and asked, “Your number is 13?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The mother's nest was silent for a moment and said, "Yes, master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you want to accept the instructions of the mother ship?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of saying this, Richard’s heart was quite uneasy. If the mother's nest is really related to the reaper and obeys the Reaper's orders, then he will immediately withdraw all followers from Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in the army where Faro survives, the parent nest unit has occupied an absolute main position, and the mother nest itself is equivalent to an extremely powerful legendary powerhouse. It is even clearer that Richard’s mother’s nest, which has the power of hundreds of millions of people, is simply killing. As long as it is willing, sooner or later, the entire Faro will become its food, no one can stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I am not prepared to accept its instructions, although this can be difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you have a way to not accept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I have completed the soul, now I have full independent thinking ability, and I have the ability to refuse the Reaper. My order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an answer that made Richard very surprised. He immediately asked: "If you have not executed the soul, you cannot refuse. Reaper's instructions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It's like I couldn't refuse your order at the time. But the Reaper's authority is still there. Above you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Raymond soul to complete the plan, there will be no current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the reaper has compiled the mother's nest, then Faro will inevitably fall. It is now that Richard is not willing to fight against the mother's nest in a turbulent place. Thousands of god warriors around the nest can be more difficult than a thousand small fighters. It is a pity that the strongest of these gods is to deal with the soul, so it is useless in the war with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can only be attributed to fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean, mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
