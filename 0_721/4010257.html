The Zonghu, which is sacred by the blood, recovers naturally faster than the healing of the great priest. And those chains seem to be ordinary, in fact, the power of God's punishment is added, and the damage caused can only be recovered naturally. It is not something that the priest can treat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls slowly, shrouded in the magnificent city of Baroque. Wangcheng was built on the mountain. The palace has a glorious golden wall. It has a history of more than a thousand years. The generations of kings have been built and become the scale of today's cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black robe, the black-haired shawl of the Zonghu appeared at the entrance of the palace, and lighted the waist to the guards, and walked straight into the gate. The guards apparently got the news, they were silent, only a young guard could not understand, and said: "Who?? The palace is also you can sneak..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t finish a sentence, he was stunned by the older guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk nonsense! Don't you want to live?" The captain whispered in the ear of the young guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards screamed twice and suddenly stopped struggling. The captain suddenly felt that his hands were warm, and he looked down and looked at it with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young guard suddenly spewed blood all over the body, and the body was instantly covered with countless blood lines, then broken into hundreds of pieces of meat, pieces rolled Fall to the ground. The guardian captain stayed in the same place, staring at the pile of pieces of meat that were still creeping, covered with the blood of the young guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows when Zonghu is moving, and he doesn’t know how he is going. The black robe black hair, the figure that gradually drifted away, seems so grand at this moment, his shadow is huge enough to cover the entire king city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, in a quiet and quiet courtyard, there is a warm light. One beautiful maid shuttles in and out. In the living room on one side, a young and beautiful woman is sitting in front of the dressing table and removing makeup with the help of the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sorrow in her eyebrows, and the maid next to him said, "You don't have to worry, you will win if you play this battle." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is of course." The young queen smiled and said that only the smile was very stubborn. Somehow, looking at herself in the mirror, she always felt that it was covered with a layer of black air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a loud noise in the courtyard, and the closed door suddenly detached from the door frame, slamming two times and falling in the center of the courtyard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black robe with a black face and a beautiful face that does not resemble the mortal color of Zonghu came in. The maids who ran out of the temple immediately screamed and screamed and called the guard. But let them call their throats, the entire palace is quiet, no warriors appear, as if they are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu took out the gold waist card and threw it in the center of the courtyard. All the maids immediately booed. The young man, such as the devil's incarnation, walked straight into the living room and stared at the pale face, but the proud queen stood on the steps of the main hall. He suddenly smiled and said, "Are you the one that Arnold claims to be the most loved woman?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the Queen! Who are you?" The young queen tried to straighten her body, even though Zong Hu’s eyes fell on her body, making her feel as acupunctured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zong Hu’s hand slowly extended to the Queen’s chest, and the eyes screamed with a strange and gloomy flame, saying, “Who is not important to me, what is important is that you are mine now!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s palace suddenly screams and screams, echoing in the night sky of the palace, for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another palace, a favorite who was very much loved by Arnold was put on the costume of the maid, and his face was pale and rushed out to the palace. When the screams came from far away, she almost fell and fell! She steadily breathed and ran outside the palace more quickly. She was born in an ancient family, and her family was deeply rooted in the blood of the kingdom. Therefore, she got news earlier than the Queen. She also knows what happened in the past and already knows what will happen in the last few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a court warrior suddenly came out of the darkness and stopped in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out! Do you know who I am?" Screaming, but even in the case of hysteria, she also desperately lowered her volume. I am afraid that I will be heard by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court warrior was expressionless and said coldly: "The command of His Majesty, no one in the harem can leave his palace this week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, this is... the order of your majesty?" She suddenly tried to smile, revealing her most beautiful side, and took a string of precious gemstone bracelets from her arms and stuffed them into the hands of the court warrior. She said, "What is your name? As long as you let the road go, I You will never forget yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The command of your majesty, no one in the harem can leave his palace this week." The court warrior repeated Once again, the order is mechanical, just like magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet the face gradually dim, lost soul, turned and walked inside the palace. She knows that in his former position, the devil will never let go of himself. After suffering from her suffering, even if she can survive, Arnold will never ask her again. All the glory and luxury will go with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, she actually felt that the wind that was blowing was full of despair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same starry sky, some people are desperate, some are angry, some are prepared to fight, and some are indulgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods of heaven, and the eyes of all living beings, concentrated on Baroque for a time, concentrating on the land that is about to usher in destruction and rebirth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war, someone will sacrifice and someone will grow up. Some people will bloom brightly, but most people will be obscured, and they will become a stepping stone for heroes with flesh and bones. Regardless of the final battle situation, in the new epic, only the hero will be sung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Faro, the forest, spring and hunting goddess of the three goddesses came together to seek advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard is at the most urgent moment, he knows that the power of the three goddesses is weak, but he still met the priests in the first place. No matter how weak the gods are, the three goddesses are the most orthodox true gods of Faro. With them behind, Richard is equivalent to wearing a layer of the best protective color, which can be safely mixed in the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is less than a year since the second war of the longitudinal line. The ranks of the three goddess grand priests have each been promoted to the first level, showing that the god is Zhenglong. This is a reward for their ability to advance their faith in the territory of Richard, but from another perspective, the distress of the three goddesses can also be seen, and hundreds of new believers in the district can make them so excited. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after listening to the three goddess of the great gods, Richard’s eyebrows began to be locked, then he opened up, and finally, although the calmness did not reveal too much clue, But it is also obvious that the mood is pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean that the intruder will appear in the Baroque Kingdom, after about a month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen must nod his head: "At least one month! When the gods jointly release the gods, they will also try to stop the invaders from entering the world, thus giving the guards enough time. So we have some time to prepare "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big surprise for Richard. I didn't expect the guy who invaded the Faro plane to really arrive a month later. It seems that the interference of the gods in this plane is one of the important reasons for the “lost time” when the plane is transmitted. Another surprise is the location of the invaders in the shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroque Kingdom? If Richard is not mistaken, there is the old nest of the goddess Ludreis! As a god of powerful divine power, the invaders appearing in their own nests will be prepared for a grand welcoming ceremony anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the map, spread it out on the table, and began to study the location of the Baroque Kingdom. He didn't notice that the flowing sand had a smug smile and a sorrowful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard looked up and looked at the three big priests looking forward to him and asked: "The three goddesses mean..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen said: "I got the goddess of the goddess yesterday. Our three goddess churches are meager, but this is a world war, so we will not back down, nor fear. Sacrifice, will go all out to this defense war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "The greatness of the goddess is impressive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren’s tone turned softly and euphemistically said: "The goddess’ determination is great, but our strength is very limited. So, we want to ask you Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? What can I do?" Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are now the king of the gods, and there is another formidable army under us. We are not far from the Baroque Kingdom, if you are willing to send troops, Contributing to the whole world, the goddess will not forget your achievements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha caressed the short beard and looked serious The map, sinking, said: "This matter... need to think about it. After all, there are too many enemies around me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Gods and the Aristocratic Private Army Sending troops is a tradition of Faro's plane. The invader's wreckage is the priest's best sacrifice for the true God's favor, and the nobility can also get a series of benefits from the gods to the artifact. However, the goddess and the priesthood of the three goddesses are not very good, so the attraction is not so good. In the traditional intruder war, the more powerful the temple, the more able to unite to the powerful aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren, Fermi, and Xiyou turn to persuade, but Richard is not moving, not to mention the soldiers. The last three priests looked at each other and had to leave without help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
