			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon's joy is justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five knights, even if they are all first-class knights made of first-stage modular inserts, mean at least one hundred pieces. Dispersed into three years, the average is made into nearly three pieces per month. However, the success rate of the magic pattern is not 100%, even if the big builder has a certain chance of failure. Ordinary builders have an average success rate of only one-third in the manufacture of first-order magic patterns, and the average large builder has half to one-third chance of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the manufacturing time of a first-order construction varies from one month to five or six days, it is not free to compress. In the time of making the decoration, in fact, many of them are spent checking the error of the hand-drawn magic array, and then correcting it. The probability of a bias error depends on the accuracy of the drawing, which is the core requirement of the builder. And this is the strongest point of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average time for the drawing of the first-order construction is less than seven days, and the probability of failure is only between 10% and 20%. From this data, it is close. The level of the sacred architect. But who is the sacred architect on the mainland who will be bored to draw the first-order structure? This is also the reason why Richard's occasional super-level performance of the high degree of fitness, high rate of addition, the plug-in price that can be used for composite construction is so expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower failure probability, shorter drawing time, the same material can be made in two or even three parts, which is made for occasional production All the structures can be sold at market prices, which obviously means an incredible profit rate, which is the real reason why Richard has recorded millions of gold coins in the past year or more. It is because of these experiences that Richard dared to join the ranks of the battles early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by Gordon, the plane battle is by the military. Although the strength of individual force is important, it is not a decisive factor, unless it is owned by Su Helun. You can turn heads-up into a group of terrorists. Ten first-order knights, plus the income from selling the best composites, are enough to create a small core force to explore low-risk low-level planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane system is vast and endless, and no one knows how much there is, nor what happens in the unknown plane. Every once in a while, I will hear a lucky one discovering a valuable mineral treasure in the low-level plane. There will also be rumors that a bad lucker has paid a heavy price to capture a high-level plane, but found that it is actually poor. The tragic story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a comfortable laugh, Gordon began to think and indulged for a long time before saying: "Since you have such talent, many things must be done in advance. Before I actually enter the plane, I will equip you with the necessary equipment, and you also need to go to our Archimonde family base to choose a few personal defenders. Then, you have to specify one who also has the Archimonde lineage. Your partner, if you have looked at it, it is ok to want two or three. This is your unique special right. Then you have to try to make a real knight, no need, one can I will provide you with the selection of the knight's candidates, mounts and materials. When these things are all done, I can almost prepare the sacrifices for you, and you can enter the Eternal Dragon Hall, the Dragon of Eternity and Time. Sacrifice to see what kind of care can be given to the Dragon God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee wrote down a few things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon thought about it and said: "The woman of Su Helun still owes me a favor. She promised to help me once in the ceremony of the Eternal Dragon Hall. But I am not in desperate need of the eternal dragon temple, I will use this opportunity on you! I will write a letter to her to see what help can come. Well, there is nothing else, you live. The place should be packed too. You can move freely on this floating island. All the places are open to you, or you can walk to the lower part of the floating world, but remember to be careful, we are now in the floating world. The enemies are like a lot of hair. But as long as it is in the public area, there should be no big problem. The old guys are very jealous. I really dare to go down with you, my son. I don’t know how to sneak into the secluded chick. Place to go, hahaha.” Gordon stopped the laughter and cleared his throat in the calm and undulating eyes of Richard. “Finally, spend more time to see your sisters, they have a lot of People are still on this floating island, as long as it is The fact that people who have a partner, you can specify "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Richard frowned and said, "Is this thing temporarily released?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon laughed again, but his tone was arrogant and said: "No, This is a task that every Archimonde must complete. And the partner is actually not binding on you, you can treat this as a kind of ... continue the work of the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not Archimonde," Richard said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't abandon the blood, it's a part of your soul, and it's the same as Archimonde." Moreover, I feel that you are not qualified to refuse this obligation now." Gordon is very calm this time, not as excited as Richard. Richard is silent, as Gotton said, he is indeed not qualified to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his home, Richard threw himself directly into the bed and looked up at the ceiling above his head. This meeting with Gordon is not as pleasant as any previous one. But any meeting, no matter what the situation, is impossible to be happy. As long as you see Gotton, Richard’s former home will appear in front of him. In fact, he always had a doubt in his heart, that is why mothers lived in Rutherland Village for ten years? Why would you rather burn yourself than go to see your father? Now that I have had so many experiences, I think back to my childhood memories. Richard knows that my mother is also deeply in love with Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where Richard is contradictory, and it is also the reason why he struggles repeatedly, but accepts many support from Gordon. Today, Richard finally knows the true meaning of his mother's wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilane, actually still wants to be with Gordon, just in another way, a way that is almost impossible to achieve. Her pride is not in any of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ancient traditions of Archimonde passed through the heart, and Richard suddenly touched his heart. Through these three traditions, he seems to have seen the scenes of Archimonde fighting in flames and blood in the past millennium. People continue to fall, and people continue to stand up. The ancient and mysterious blood is awakened in the fire and battle, and the first cry of new life is passed down. It is struggle, it is struggle, it is unyielding. The blood of Archimonde, like the volcano in the family cemetery, is erupting without a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of tombstones on the volcano is so low because only Archimonde, who has awakened the blood, is qualified to finally sleep in the family cemetery. At the top of the list, the six Akmonds who have their real names should be the heroes of the other side. Although they have not recorded any of their deeds on the tombstone, the real name can already explain everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already outside, through the long, tall windows, you can see the night sky of the fourth string of blue moon hanging here, blue The moonlight splashed down and dyed the trees and mountains outside the window into a faint blue. The long knife without a sheath is placed on the edge of the bed, and the blade of the blade reflects the blue moonlight. The faint star-shaped light jumps in the secluded blade, and the beauty is like a dream. The blood of the silver moon elf in the body of Richard also woke up in the day, and began to sense the monthly force of the blue moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Richard is particularly sensitive to the blue moon, and when Gordon is showing that the secret sword is broken, he never reverts and resolutely decides. The beautiful and staunch, but suddenly let him have a feeling of seeing his mother. Father said that this sword was used by my mother. Then, under what circumstances will the mother use this sword that is in the same shape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
