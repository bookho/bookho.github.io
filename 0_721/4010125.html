No matter where the sages inside are sacred, in the presence of a sanctuary strongman and a powerful family viscount, there is always some convergence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the suite on the top floor of the hotel, Richard looked at the environment inside the suite, his face finally gloomy, and his own short hair. This action has become a habit, so that he can suppress the temper in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suite has been re-arranged and placed on seven chairs, five of which have already been seated by a magician. Only the largest chair in the middle and the chair on the far edge of the right hand are still empty. These wizards are all older, and the magic fluctuations are strong and weak, but they are all between ten and twelve. They wear the Master's Gown and do their best in luxury. They are decorated with a complex and magical array, but Richard himself is the master of the magic circle. Big Magister can compare. So at a glance, he saw that the magic array on these mage robes had almost no use. Of course, if you barely look for it, you can still find two uses. One is to be able to attach magical fluctuations to the Master's Gown, and let people recognize the identity of their great magician. The other one is that these silver patterns are indeed elegant and luxurious decorations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, there are several golden armored warriors standing on the wall, and the armor style is also the theme of complexity, exquisiteness and luxury. These warriors should be the guards of the mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Richard silent is that there are only seven chairs in the entire hall, no seats for Richard, and even less for Richard. Prepare the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, but the site of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the three men came in, the last thin old magician in the left hand lifted his eyelids. When his eyes swept over Luofu, he could not help but Oh, I’ve just sat a little straighter, but the respect for the Sanctuary Swordsman is nothing more than that. The old magician looked at Richard again. After confirming Richard's age and his magical fluctuations, his eyes flashed a hint of hatred. The old magician seems to have five or sixty appearances, but the magic is only ten, which is obviously deeply stimulated by the rank and age of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician looked at Richard with his eyes obliquely, and asked coldly: "Is Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Richard, this place is my territory." Richard replied faintly. He is not in a hurry to make trouble, but wants to see what these mage who are suddenly emerging want to do. If there is something happening, Richard doesn't mind going to kill them all. The five old mages sat so close together that a fireball was enough to reimburse them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician nodded and said arrogantly: "Well, Master Kalimi wants to see you, you are standing here waiting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, even the faces of Luofu and Heim have changed. Luofu said that it was just a gloomy face. The sacred strongman is not very eager. However, the fat face of Him has begun to be distorted. The Viscount used to be a character who ran across the Sequoia Kingdom. However, it was the overbearing who directly robbed him, and Richard had also taught it. Looking at the whole kingdom, few people can concede Him, except for the fierce women like Countess Ekaterina. Of course, in the heart of Him, the horror of Richard is second only to the countess. But what Him is really dare to do now is just a curse. The mammoth of the Mage Association is that the king also has to be polite. Heim relied on his own special blood, and he decided that these wizards would not really take him. But if he wants to move the Masters Association, it is even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he had a thick mouth on his lips, Richard suddenly raised his hand to stop him, and then said faintly: "Okay, then I will wait a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard really stood in the middle of the hall and waited safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the case, but the opposite Masters are uneasy. The temperature in the hall seems to be gradually decreasing, and the two immortal old masters have played a few chills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study window inside, the old magician standing in a golden robe. His hair is almost full of baldness, and only a thin white hair around the bright skull. His face was full of fat, and there were several obvious old spots on it. Next to the old magician, stood a middle-aged mage, wearing a silver-colored robes like the outside wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians are standing in front of the window, staring blankly at a group of humanoid warriors that are lined up in the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged magician suddenly raised his hand and said with excitement: "Look, Master Kalimi! Look at the soldiers! All they hold in their hands Magic sword, hey, my god! The magical brilliance is so dazzling, it must be a fine-level enchanted sword. This level of magic equipment is me, and one of the most refined one month. And now I see How many?... At least eighty soldiers, that is, eighty excellent swords. And so on, they have shields on their backs! The gods are on, those shields are also enchanting equipment!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old sorcerer’s turbid eyes also have a radiance, the pupil reflects the radiance of magic, and the face reveals a trace of greed that cannot be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged magician suddenly looked awkward and said: "To collect taxes! Be sure to collect taxes! All enchanting equipment must be transferred through the Masters Association. Master The association is the ultimate destination for all mages!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalime nodded slowly and said, "This is a good statement. The Masters Association is the ultimate of all Masters." We should set up a bridge for the Master to communicate with the world, and the Masters only need to advance on the path of magic. These enchanting equipment are too dangerous for an ordinary Master and need to be mastered by the Masters Association. Let the wise men master their uses and whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your decision is too wise!" The middle-aged mage praised and excitedly held his hands. Said: "So many enchanting equipment, if franchised by the Masters Association, will increase our annual income by 30%. But that Richard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalimi said in a cry: "Give him a position as a silver robe mage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mage said, "Silver robe mage? This is the top of the Masters Association. He seems to be less than twenty years old! And we all struggled on the magical road for more than 20 years. For the Masters Association, I have also contributed more than ten years of youth. In addition, six of the mages who want to promote the silver robe this year are almost sixty years old. If the position of the silver robe is given to Richard, then these are highly respected. What do the old wizards think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is indeed a problem, but if I remember correctly, they just barely reached the tenth level? Richard has At the 12th level, the magic is one level higher than you," Kalimi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, silver robe is a symbol of the noble status of the Master, should be judged by the contribution of the Master Association, the level is not the only standard. If Richard took up A quota, then we have to reject an experienced old mage. I think, give him a silver vest alternate." The middle-aged mage insisted on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
