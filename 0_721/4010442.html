			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today’s extremely bad situation, if Hastings has something wrong That means that Dax Sodas will have a semi-legendary power to be freed, which is an unimaginable nightmare for all Sanctuary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin cough almost to the ground, and finally stood up straight, waved the big magician to push away, said: "I... I am fine, I am just too happy. With this demon study, I can find the weakness of their royal family, I can... I can take revenge..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the last sentence, the legendary Master’s voice turned into a stunned voice. After a long time, he sighed and said, “I have waited for more than 20 years, so long. Time has passed, and the sinister sorcerer should still be alive. No, he was the legendary strongman. How could he die? He just didn’t know that he was still not in the dusk. Hope... you haven’t gone yet. ..." The last sentence has become a whisper of inaudible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting’s past is a mystery, and most of the strong men in the day’s capitals only know that he came here more than 20 years ago. Then I have been centered on the sun and the city. No one can tell his identity and deeds in Noland. He is moody, and he has no reason to speak, and he is guilty, so many people will subconsciously avoid. Hestin was opened, but he was afraid to offend him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this devil is so useful to you, it would be better, then we will go back first. There are still some formalities for this call." The big magister said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting waved impatiently and said, "Leave it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But the two warriors looked at Hastings who seemed to fall at any time, but did not immediately let go of the hand of the young devil, and asked with concern: "His Royal Highness, your current situation does not seem very good, Don't add a few more shackles to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin’s mouth began to sag deeply, coldly: "A devil, I am a little magic." No, I also picked it up, let go, and then gave me a roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two warriors looked at each other and let go, but still kept on guard, one has If he was not right, he planned to take control of the young demon. The black cockroaches were free at first, and some looked around in vain. The twins suddenly flashed through the cold and rushed to Hastings. Hestin made him instinctively feel the fear. So he would rather die than fall into Hastings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage showed a disdainful expression on his face, only a heavy sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young devil heard this snoring, the soul was suddenly slammed, his eyes turned, and he fainted, the warriors of the two marshals were in the same mind. A tearful tear, almost fainted, their faces were pale, and they dared not stop, and hurriedly walked outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall has only a doorway and no door panel. When the three Marshal Guards walked out of the hall, they just passed by with one person. The instructor recognized the young man at a glance and immediately let the road open and greeted with respect: "Master Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is a magician, This big magister has 19th grade, and the magic is far beyond Richard, but he is more respectful to Richard than others, not just because of the identity of Richard, but because he knows clearly Once Richard decides to step over the threshold of the Great Magister, how terrible it is to be able to put the magic on the edge of the Jin Dynasty for more than a year, and look at the entire dusk, not exceeding the number of fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha made a simple greeting to the great magician, which is a return, he is now in a hurry, not much mood in the entertainment, this big magician Originally, I wanted to talk to Richard about the levy of the demon, but Richard had bypassed him in a step and walked into the main hall of Hastings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, it is me, Richard." Richard cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dark and humid voice from Hastings in the depths of the hall: "It turned out that Richard is coming. Do you have anything? If there is nothing important, I I won’t receive you, I have some very important things to do now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are quite welcome, but everyone familiar with the legendary mage knows This is already a very high courtesy. Hastings not only explained the reasons, but also left a living point for Richard. He did not directly drive him out. This kind of courtesy is more important than the identity of Richard’s royal architect. It was Richard's brilliant record. Dax Sodas went to the camp for a battle, and White Nights reinvented the other's legendary powerhouse, while Richard almost cleared the forward camp with hundreds of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle also alarmed the two camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and the White Night are equally dazzling, and Richard is even more eye-catching, because he is not even a big magician, now the young generation of the entire Holy Alliance In the middle, Richard has been regarded as the first candidate for the future legend, so the courtesy of Hasting to Richard is even above the heavenly sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of dusk, what status is false, only the record is king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of this battle, while making Richard’s contribution to the undefeating capital of the day directly jumped into the top ten, has qualified enough to meet in the highest meeting of the fortress Speak up loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to answer, his eyes have been attracted by the light of the magic platform, and the girl lying inside is so familiar, only looking at the outline, I know That is the splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shuihua." Li cried out and ran directly to the magic station. But he only took two steps, and Hastings suddenly stopped in front of Richard. Legendary Master's statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quite violent action made Hasting cough up violently. He finally calmed down and said: "This little guy and you." Is it related, is she your soul guard? Oh, then I have to say that your luck is really good, but if you want her to stand up intact, it is best not to move that magic array. I only completed one-third of the treatment, and at least two treatments were needed to complete the repair of her wounded soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, I apologize later: "You are treating her, sorry, I am reckless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting said with a hoarse voice: "If you really think If I owe it to me, I really need to compensate me. Your builders are very good at home. I am welcome. Two top sacrifices, or a set of three-order custom suits. Flat, you don't owe me anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately said: "No problem, It takes me some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin nodded: "Well, you can do it as soon as possible. I have a big deal in my hand recently, I need a lot. Money, and the guy lying there, I have to prepare a set of special magical experimental equipment for it, at least it must be a limited edition of Dragon Blood Gnome. This kind of thing is getting more and more price in Noland. It’s high.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked down the direction of Hasting’s finger and cried: “Black, how is it here?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hastings said, "Black, this is his name, how do you know his name." Speaking of this, the legendary Master suddenly raised his voice and called out to the temple: "You come in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men of the Marshal Guard heard the sound of entering the hall, and the head of the great magister said to Richard: "Master Richard, we received the news. There is a demon in your dwelling place, and he is found to be the royal family of the devil, so the marshal decided to immediately use it for the study of His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Richard's face immediately sank, sweeping up the three people with cold eyes, slowly said: "This devil is what I caught, I also tamed, you did not even ask me a question. It was directly expropriated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister was stared at by Richard’s gaze, and he even had a chill in the inexplicable, but he still straightened his body. Without retreat, he said: "Master Richard, this is the decision of the marshal. In the capital of the day, the marshal has the right to special time. Requisition of all private property, and you will receive adequate compensation, you should be aware that this expropriation does not require your consent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound is even more chilly: "This demon is still alive. Does that mean that you can enter my home at any time, as long as you like, 'expropriate' my property, even a woman."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister has also aroused arrogance and raised his voice. He said: "Any expropriation is for the day and night, for the entire twilight. Marshal has no selfishness. If you must ask me to give you an answer, then I can give you an answer now, yes, your property, your demon, or even..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even a woman." Richard said the rest of the story for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister once again raised his voice and said, "If she is defined as 'property', then the answer is: yes, but any expropriation will give you Sufficient compensation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, the temple suddenly saw a knife, several cold light with the shadow of death, scratched the deep darkness . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin just wanted to go forward, suddenly his face changed, suddenly stopped in place, there was a magic shield in his body, and he would stab like a ghost. The extinction bounced off, but the magic shield shook. Hastings immediately discovered that there was no power at the extinction of the long knife. He suddenly felt awkward and knew what happened to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
