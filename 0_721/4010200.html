Agamemnon finally glared and said: "Is it strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's weird!" Nyris was stunned and smirked. "You will laugh at this wood, and you will be angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon snorted and stopped making a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, hurry." Richard, the leader of the team, said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team finally calmed down and silently marched through the forest. At the front of the team, Richard shook his head and instigated the unicorn to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting dim, and the night falls slowly on the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the team who are good at scouting find a piece of open space in the forest, and everyone will stop. Everyone does not use tents, sit directly on the ground, or lean on the tree. There are a lot of magicians in the team, and they are free to inspire a few magical flames. They heat the dried meat used for dry food, and even the water that they carry with them is a dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 sits directly on the ground, but this dress is not hers, it is a man’s, and does not bring the necessary supplies like other people. . Richard waved at her, called her over, laid a waterproof poncho on the floor and said to her, "Let's sleep here after eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;黛美 Look at the people around, bite the teeth: "Nothing, I just want to find a place to sit on the line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled and lowered the voice Say: "Have a good rest, don't be able to. You are different from other people. If you have a bad rest, it will affect the performance during the battle. You must know that the performance during the battle is the key."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 nodded, honestly crouched on the tarpaulin, began to try hard to go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at her lying down, so she smiled and found a place to sit down and rest. When everyone finished eating, they all started to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not arrange a vigil. For this team, there is no need to watch the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, everyone turned over, and Richard instigated the unicorn, and directly chose a direction, and went to the depths of the forest. In the forest that could not be separated from the direction, Richard did not hesitate to find the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard have long been accustomed to being in charge of everything, and they know that when Richard does not seek advice, it is absolutely certain. However, the subordinates of Nyris and Agamemnon did not know why Richard was so certain, and they all had some face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard and the elite humanoid knight still maintain a link to the soul, indicating that the humanoid knight is still alive. The connection is very vague, meaning that the distance between the two sides is far beyond the 30-kilometer boundary, but there is no problem in judging the general direction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team did not go far, suddenly it was like crossing an invisible border, and suddenly an invisible hammer of the soul slammed into the consciousness of everyone. Then there was a heavy weight that fell on their souls. People's consciousness began to be dull, their vision was blurred, and the boundary between heaven and earth began to merge, and even maintaining balance became difficult. A few fighters have become embarrassed, not even knowing that they have deviated from the team and are walking deep into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware! This is where I was affected by the will!" Sher reminded loudly. But it can be seen that his status is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blow and suppression of the will and the soul. After the initial heart attack, it is the constant pressure on the soul. At this moment, there is a clear distinction between the will of the people and the strength of the soul. In the traditional view of Noland, the strong will of the soul is always the key to shocking the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon are currently at the 17th level and have not officially stepped into the sanctuary. But they are significantly better affected than Schell and Pamir, and even seem to be stronger than Long Master Lina. Yan Mei also showed a very strong will and a powerful soul, almost comparable to Lina. A strong will is the hallmark of true Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shocking scene appeared at this time, and the followers of Richard showed an incredibly powerful addition to the Oral. Will and soul. Sand, water, twilight and even tiramisu, either condensed or confronted, or the face is painful, but the action is almost completely unaffected! These performances have even been stronger than Nyris and Agamemnon! Even Oral does not look worse than Schell and Pamir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is a truly shocking one. He only frowned slightly, but there was nothing wrong with it. The pressure of the soul that made everyone secretly confront God seemed to be non-existent to him. Only the sand and the water are clear. After resisting the gun of the Troll Superintendent's soul, Richard's soul has become extraordinary and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the forest is heavy, for Richard, just like carrying a normal parcel, the weight is not worth mentioning. But he has nothing to do with nothing. This is a war. Can't he just rush to the nest of the Greenwood Elf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a situation that Richard did not expect at all. Schell said that crossing the 100-kilometer line would be affected by the will, but Richard did not expect the impact to be so great for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was in a dilemma, his unicorn felt his troubles, and the sacred animal that consumed divinity was still on the twilight. The sound of Changchun and Qingyue spread far and wide. Its unicorn tip shines with a soft silver radiance. The silver brilliance is not very bright, but the penetrating power is extremely strong, and it spreads far away, covering the range of tens of meters around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people immediately felt that the soul was relaxed for a while, the original pressure had gone to the tenth, and even the weakest soldiers were able to hurry and fight normally. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris complexed and said, "Is this a holy unicorn? It's amazing, it's really amazing!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four emperors said that they are unicorns, but the eyes are watching Richard, the look is extremely complicated, admirable, shocked, and a little bit blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher, Pamir, two strong self-esteemed, high-spirited people, now looking at Richard's eyes is full of shock and respect. It’s not just for Richard, but the expression of the followers of Richard’s followers has become extremely complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of a strong will and soul, but anyone with knowledge is very clear. That is a necessary condition for becoming a strong person. Although it may not be successful, it does not work without it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is no problem, after all, is the most proud student of the legendary Master Su Hailun in recent years. However, the followers he gathered were also amazingly stunning, showing amazing potential. Although I don't know how far they can go, they can be sure that entering the sanctuary is not their end! Even the weakest Oral is worse than Shel and Pamir. How did such a group of metamorphosis gather under Richard’s position? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher and Pamir have a deeper thought in the blink of an eye. What is Richard? The powerful soul that Richard showed has completely overwhelmed everyone, even on the sand of the gods. Where is his end? Is it a new decade after another ten years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher and Pamir look at each other and understand that there is a song in front of them, and now there is Richard, it seems that the rise of Archimonde is no longer Block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has noticed a slight change in the attitudes of the people, and somewhat understands their minds. However, he just pointed to the front and said, "Go ahead, there is still a long way ahead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this direction, in the direction of Richard’s finger, The Bailusen elves are gathering under an incomparably huge ancient tree to welcome the warriors who have returned from the expedition. A sturdy night leopard rushed to the gathering of elves, and the body shape changed, returning to an old Druid look. He raised the natural staff in his hand and sighed: "We are back! And caught the important person in the invasion of the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are full of joy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring the captives up!" said Druid elders in a majestic manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Elf Warriors came and threw the elite human knight who was tied up by the vines to the ground. Seeing this intruder, many of the elves had red eyes and cursed the invaders in the most vicious language of their lives. Some even raised a short knife and tried to stab a few knives. It took less than two months for Richard to come to the Greenson plane. Most of the elves of this tribe had relatives or people they knew died in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid coughed, and several elf warriors immediately protected the elite human knight and stopped the excited elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid said to the elves: "He is an important person, we exchanged the chips of Zhu Bu, can not be hurt!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the name of Zhu Bu, the elves gradually calmed down, but with a more hateful look, they focused on the humanoid knight who was heavily tied up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a thick and indulgent voice came from the air: "Dear green wind elders, how are my children?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is a very tall war tree, the trunk is several times thicker than the ordinary tree, and the tall and generous canopy barely sees the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid elders said with a deep green wind: "I feel very painful, but they are impossible to escape the invaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient tree of war sighed heavily and said, "I know that my children have gone, and they have no plans to come back. I only hope that their sacrifice will ultimately be valuable. You Go, the elders are waiting for you, and I need to be alone for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind is deep and says: "If you "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the elves, it is a huge, amazing tree with a trunk that is tens of meters thick and from the bottom Looking up, the canopy almost obscured the entire sky! This giant tree has already had the graceful momentum of the Nolan Deer World Tree. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the trunk of the giant tree, the elves built a tree house in the natural tree hole and veins, and connected by the winding road. The green wind follows the passage and goes straight to the top of the Elf village and into a spacious wooden house. In the middle of the tree house, there is an old elf who is too old to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
