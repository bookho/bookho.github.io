This dress is still for Gangde, although it is very memorable."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mark has been extinguished, what should we do next?" "Do you take over his sphere of influence directly, or talk to a few other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not worry, wait, wait for the hammer to come to us." Be careful to seal the structure while placing another set of tools on the table to prepare the plug-in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is the hammer, not the other person?" The sand is not inquiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thunder hammer is the boss." Richard was not disturbed by the conversation, and his hands were precise, fluid, and efficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to talk to Thunder Hammer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily cooperation, you can It’s a deal, it’s just a test of each other,” Richard said. "We are outsiders, and if we want to occupy a place here, we must first look at the movement of the Thunder Hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you just end the Bloodstone Horde, The camp?” The sand was a murderous suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and knocked on her head and said, "What do you do in such a broken place? Just for those few wells? Then, Lei The hammer is a fourteenth-level warrior, and there are hundreds of seven or eight-level half-orc warriors. If he has a few more pieces of equipment, even some special forces similar to the blood, we want to end The bloodstone tribe, even if it is a sneak attack, you have to die a little. How do you say who is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." Flowing sand is always People love and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed her collar and grabbed her collar, but saw her not only raised her chest, but also twitched her lower back, so the robe was automatically loose. The signs of opening. It seems that the sand flow, as she said, will be very cooperative before the special day. However, her cooperation already has the feeling of letting Richard spurt blood. If it is rebellious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of it, Richard almost didn’t control himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally made up his mind to blast the sand, and then continued his work. Gangde's body is large and strong, and the requirements for plug-ins are much lower. After more than two hours, Richard finally completed the plug-in production. At this moment, Oral came to the room of Richard and brought an unexpected message, which was faster than Richard’s expected time. . The Bloodstone tribe has arrived at the hotel and invited Richard to have lunch with the Thunder Hammer at noon tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bunch of half-orcs, quite ceremonial!" After the report, the elf poet also did not forget to despise the group of people who pretend to be nobles but never bathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon the next day, Richard finally saw the leader of the camp and the most powerful warrior in the Stone Fortress of the Bloodstone Tribe, Thunder Hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other half-orcs in the Bloodstone tribe, the Thunder Hammer grows closer to humans, and its body is half shorter than the Orc Warrior. But every muscle that he was exposed to was condensed like steel, and almost all of his hair was shaved, leaving only three half-black and half-white scorpions. From the outside, he has begun to look old, like a 50-something old man. However, because of the hardship and desolateness of the blood-stained land, the people who lived here for a long time are far younger than they seem, so the actual age of the hammer is likely to be just in their early forties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder Hammer and Richard are sitting at the ends of a long table like a real aristocratic lunch. But only this is a bit like aristocratic life. There is only barbecue and spirits on the table. It is a hearty lunch in the blood-stained place, but in the human country, even the banquet held by the Knights is much stronger than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard’s manner is completely impeccable, even if the big aristocrats can’t perform more elegantly at the most formal luncheon than he is. The most difficult thing is that he is relaxed and relaxed. He doesn't mind that there is a gap in the plate, there are cracks on the side of the long table, and even the wine glass is not cleaned, just like being in a real luxury feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is contrary to the ease of appearance on the surface. He used the light of the corner of his eye to carefully observe the half-orc at the other end of the table to accumulate more. The data, while he also did not relax the tight nerves for a moment. The opposite half-orc gave him a very direct and strong sense of danger from beginning to end. If the hammer was attacked regardless of his own safety, then no one behind him could save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the lunch, the Thunderbolt finally spoke up: "Mr. Richard, you are a mage, and there is a mage in the entourage?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Richard nodded and admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder hammer showed a slight excitement on the face, then suppressed it and continued to ask: "I heard that the great magicians are very good at making magic items. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "I am not a great magician, but it is not too far away from that level. As for the magic items you said. Production, the scope of coverage is too broad, you know, no magician can cover all areas. For example, if you refer to the production of magical equipment and accessories, it should belong to the scope of the alchemist. Adding magical effects to existing items is the realm of the Enchanter. If you roughly calculate it, only a large area can be divided into dozens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thunderbolt, I did not think that the field of magic would be so complicated. The Orc race had no magical inheritance. The information obtained by the travellers was also vague. He thought that any magician could make magic equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated, looking at the gentle and elegant smile of the young magician opposite, finally decided to come to the door: "I am 41 this year, I want to exercise It’s very difficult to raise the combat power by one level. So I need magic equipment that can improve my combat power, no matter what it is, as long as it can make my combat power close to fifteen. Can you help me with this?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and said, "It’s not impossible, but such magic equipment requires a lot of magic material, and it will take a long time." He paused a little, and saw that the Thunder hammer made a material gesture that was not a problem, so he continued: "In addition, I also need to know the purpose of your combat effectiveness. This is very important, so that you can be tailored for you. Customize the most suitable way to improve your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
