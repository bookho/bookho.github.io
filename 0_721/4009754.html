			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered one thing, so he bluntly asked: "I The teacher won't leave a shadow for you anymore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible!" Gotton was furious and wanted to stand up, but good. When the ass just lifted up, I woke up, so I sat down and sat down with the tombstone that recorded the real name of the ancestor Archimonde. It seems that there is a possibility of breakage at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the pressure of Richard’s suspicious eyes, Gordon’s face gradually turned to cyan, and finally finally snorted and said: “The shadow is indeed a little bit But it doesn't matter at all! Isn't it money?! You Laozi, I am a good leader, but I have a few good hands. After another hundred and eighty years, I don't believe that I can't get the debt!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rhetoric is heard in Richard’s ear, but how to feel it is a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still wanted to ask a hundred or eighty years, whether it was the time of the plane or the time of Noland, but hesitated a little, would it be Gordon’s blow was too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after meeting with Su Hailun and the mountains and the sea, Richard’s character was also influenced by their subtle influences, such as chasing and slamming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard just wanted to open his mouth, and Gordon’s heart suddenly showed a very bad sense of familiarity, and he felt keenly, so he interrupted immediately. His words, said: "Okay, kid! Don't say useless, forget about the tattered things you learned in the dark blue. I will teach you the real ability to play your own blood power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon stood up and looked at Richard, whose face was uncertain. He sighed and said, "Don’t rush to refuse, I will teach you." Things don't belong to Archimonde, but your mother should teach you. But I don't think you will, so I can only teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mom?" Richard said. He always thought that his mother was just an ordinary magic apprentice. Although he has already made him understand that Ilani’s original identity is not so simple in the dark blue study, he has never reached the level of the big magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon nodded and said, "Yes, your mother was originally a member of the Silver Moon Elf, a goddess of the moon, Alucia. Sacrifice. So you actually have the blood heritage of the Silver Moon Elf. What I want to teach you now is the secret sword that has been handed down from the Moon God Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gordon had a touch on his wrist, and there was already one more than one meter and a half long in the palm. The blade was only four centimeters wide, and the blade was straight and only had a strange weapon on one side. It is not so much a sword, it is better to say that it is a long knife. Gordon gently slammed on the blade, and the long knife immediately gave a long scorn, and the blade was constantly shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, optimistic! This is the secret sword. Broken!" Gotton suddenly stepped forward, the long knife suddenly bounced, pointing straight ahead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A round of blue crescent moon quietly appeared on the head of Gordon, pouring a sparkling blue moonlight on him, so that The blade of the super-long sword also has a touch of blue. The huge body of Gordon is like a mysterious force pushing, suddenly protruding ten meters, and then the blade of the hand is silently spurting forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is beautiful and desolate, the dreamy blue is dyed with the land that Gordon has stepped on, and the power of the fourth string of the blue moon seems to be completely attached to the sword, roaring, even if the front is a dragon. Will also be pierced by the blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, Gordon stood in front of Richard. He has already received the sword, but the blue moon of the fourth string seems to really fall across the space. It is not a projection or an illusion. It is still hanging ten meters above the head of Gotton, and constantly sprinkles the cold moonlight on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorton gently stroked his long knife and said: "This is a sword your mother used in the past, so I remember to be more secure. Others The few swords were only studied in the past few years when I was idle, but I don’t have the blood of the Silver Moon Elf, so I don’t know if it’s right. You should learn first, and then have the opportunity to find a way to improve in the future.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the string moon on the top of Gotton suddenly turned from blue to red, from the blue moon of the fourth string to the red moon of the first string. His momentum has also suddenly increased, the side of the body, the same step forward, the long knife in his hand with a thick blush moonlight, silently squat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that the knife has been riding the army, and you have nowhere to go, this knife is like a thousand troops, and it’s a thunder. With the trajectory of the long knife, the moon in the air pours down, and the sleek red crystals outline a new moon in the space where Gotton dances. This is the elf secret sword corresponding to the first string of red moon: the new moon is killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it is the ring of destiny that the second string of amber is ignited, this is the all-round attack around the ring. The field of the feathers of the fifth string dyed scorpion is an erratic sting, suitable for dealing with fast-moving opponents. The sixth string of silver frosty sand will lead the spiral corridor and launch an endless attack on the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when the moon in the head of Gotton suddenly turned into the blue moon of azure, he suddenly closed his knife and the moonlight poured into the pale His shoulders, like mercury, flowed to the ground, but they spread and spread to a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the moonlight is everywhere, there is a tremendous spread of life, so the volcanic rock that was originally dark black is also dyed with thick green. There was no rock in the volcanic eruption of the crater, but at this time there was a green grass bud from the gap! The secret technique of the third string of Azure Moon: The prayer of the believer is a secret that can restore vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue moonlight with a strong sense of life fades away as the moon slowly disappears, and the hot, hot atmosphere re-rules everything, new The young grass is immediately burnt and burnt, and then turned into ashes. These embers quickly turned from dark gray and finally disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is restored to its original state, as if the change of the six-color string moon was just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This set of secret swords should have the seventh month of the Red Gold, but I can't figure out how to." The long knife was thrown to Richard, and then said: "Which! This knife was taken from an elf country in the ectopic plane, and I will give it to you now. As for the name, you will take it yourself later."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li received a long knife, but he felt unusually light and could not help but be surprised. The blade still has a strong six-string moon, but it makes some things deep in the body of the body begin to sneak. As for the seventh string month, it is the darkest of the seven rounds of the moon. Only a few days in a year will appear quietly. Even if it appears, the dark golden moon is easy to be ignored. Its monthly strength is also the most difficult to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
