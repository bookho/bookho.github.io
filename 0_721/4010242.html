Richard asked weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels very bad!" The black Usa black snake was destroyed, and he suffered a minor injury. He had lost all his patience. He did not expect that Richard, who was unstable in a station, would be so hard. Now all his ideas have been ruined. Don't say that he has set a trap for the mountains and the sea. Now is the only one who is as strong as Baalibali. He has to run away immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa’s big foot just stepped on Richard’s head and pressed his half of his face into the soil, then with crazy hatred Say: "Hurry up for mercy! If I feel good, I will hurry up and let you die so much! Otherwise, I will crush your head a little bit!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of Heusa, there is a weak voice from Richard: "Your feet... really his/mother/smelly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa took a breath and almost subconsciously went down! But he managed to control the bloodthirsty impulses in his heart and replaced them with cruel expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foot, the friction and the squeaking of the sound, let the black Usa excitement and blood flow cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s hand grasped the fate of the crystal plate, but was unable to break it in exchange for a miracle. He just smiled in the bottom of his heart, feeling that the final crystal plate seemed to be extraordinarily hard, and then consciousness gradually sank into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa has just begun to enjoy the process of killing, suddenly there is a strange whistling in the wind, a beast and whip like an oolong across the air, He sucked his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this whip is surprisingly great, that is, a rock can also be crushed, and Black Usa does not dare to harden it, and the current anger is extremely loud. , flashed to the side. The long whip took a lot of air and went straight to Richard. If the whip was taken, it would immediately burst into a vague flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the long whip suddenly turned into a turning point, from the savage to the soft and smart, the whip tip, turned Licha over, and then as soft The palm of his hand smashed the blood and mud on his face, revealing his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa stood ten meters away, slowly took off the giant axe behind him, staring at a tall, barbarian young woman who suddenly appeared, said coldly: Rama Zoya! Do you want to stand on the side of the Noland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian woman named Rama Zhuoya is tall and strong, almost no more common Barbarian men are poor. Her skin is brown, and her life is still beautiful, but what is more impressive is the strong momentum of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Black Usa coldly and said, "What do I have to do, but I can’t take it for you! What are you counting? If not, I am coming. It seems that you still want to kill the appointment of your Highness! When you push the responsibility to Baalibali? You really fool everyone else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa's face is uncertain, vicious, hesitant and unwilling to alternate, and finally only said gloomy: "La Ma Zhuoya, you don't want to talk nonsense! I don't want to kill the appointed person, just want to give He just learned the lesson. But your strength has soared recently, no wonder you dare to intervene in my affairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lama Zhuo spit in disgustingly, and a ten-meter long whip made a series of explosions in the air, saying, "I will intervene, what are you going to do, nigga? Do you want to fight now?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa almost spurts out fire, four huge canine teeth rubbing, biting his teeth: "Now? You can really pick time! Good, I remember Live your challenge, you wait, it will not take long for me to regret you! You better hide from the temple from now on, never come out! Otherwise, once you fall into my hands, I Will make your big ass well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rama Zhuoya face a cold, long whip slamming to black Usa! Black Usa snorted, the giant axe raised, and the long whip hardened a fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a thunderous explosion, Black Usa took a few steps back and Rama Zhuoya stepped back two steps. It seems that Rama Zhuoya has the upper hand, but the strength of the black Usa is greatly damaged. This is actually only a disadvantage, and the strength comparison between the two sides is immediately revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa slowly squats like a beast, clenched a huge axe, his eyes staring at Rama Zhuoya, his eyes gradually revealing fierce light. Rama Zhuoya also showed up in vain, and God was ready to fight. Black Usa's strength is much higher than she expected. It seems that if he didn't know why he was seriously injured for what reason, he was not his opponent. It is now that if life and death are a battle, the results are hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden and awkward voice in the distance: "Black Usa! Rama Zoya! Why are you here too?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is like sounding in their ears, but looking up, the man is still on the horizon, just a little black dot. At the end of his eyesight, a barbarian youth is running at full speed. His movements are not elegant, and there is no rhythm. It is just a sense of power and simplicity. It seems that he is rushing all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eminem!" Black Usa's face changed, then stared at Rama Zhuoya and said: "This time you are lucky!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Black Usa turned around and ran to the far side, the direction is just the opposite of Eminem. Rama Zhuoya did not stop, but took a step back, facing Eminem, his face showed a look of God's alert. But her whiplash of the long whip shivered slightly and looked extremely nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Eminem finally ran to the front of Rama Zoya, wiping his sweat with his sleeves, and panting like a cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amm’s speed doesn’t look fast, at least Black Usa is much faster than him, and he can’t be with Lama Zoya and Baaliba. ratio. But Eminem looked at the back of Black Ossa, but he shook his head regretfully and sighed: "I didn't expect to meet him here. It's a pity. If you change the time, you won't let him run away!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lama Zhuoya began to sweat at the tip of his nose, and the color of tension could not be concealed. She knows that although the speed of Eminem is not very fast, his physical strength is almost endless. If Amu really wants to chase a person, he can run for several days and nights, and it is not surprising to chase tens of thousands of kilometers. If the opponent chased by him does not want to be exhausted, it is best to go back and fight with Amu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amu looked down at Richard and said, "This is the person who agreed? It has already been hurt like this. It seems that I can't challenge him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rama Zhuoya breathed a sigh of relief, and Eminem’s statement has already indicated his position. In fact, the young strongmen who appear here at this time are all similar, and it is difficult to have other possibilities. It’s just that the pressure that Eminem brings to Lama Zhuoya is too great. No one can easily face an opponent who can chase you to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to challenge him too?" Rama Zhuoya couldn't help but confirm it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I also want to see how powerful the appointment of His Highness is." Eminem said a little embarrassed. But he immediately looked at Rama Zoya with a suspicious look and asked, "But what are you doing? Are you not a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense! Of course I am a woman! Rama Zoya was furious, and the long whip was beating on the ground, but she did not dare to really take it out. She suppressed her anger and explained: "You are rushing to challenge him. It is just to let him know how difficult it is to retreat. But after a few years, he may even come back, what is the use? I want the choice of His Royal Highness. The agreed people are not going to go anywhere, anyway, I am also old, it is better to steal back to be my man, and then see what kind of child can be born."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not quite right..." Eminem frowned, rubbing his hands hard, walking around in the same place, thinking about something. After a while, he suddenly took a shot of his head, loudly: "I understand! If he is snatched back to sleep, then his Highness can't ask him any more. If you even have children, then It is equal to completely cutting off all the ideas of His Royal Highness! It is really insidious, and it is really willing to pay the cost! Is this not your idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Ma Zhuoya face The number of moments changed, barely keeping a smile, saying: "Eminem, although you are very powerful, but not everyone can get it. This matter, you still do not care, I am also unable to help." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness will not let you go," Eminem said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness will not tear down our temples. As long as I succeed in giving birth to my children, it will be fine." Lama Zhuo said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amm took a hard look at the traces of the battle left around, and then looked at Richard, who was already in a coma, and sighed and said, "I think, you There is no loss at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rama Zoya screamed, and the anger again rose, saying: "Eminem! If you insult me ​​again, I would rather Death will also fight you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amm does not care about her threat, continue to say: "I am serious. Lama Zoya, you too I look at myself and I’m underestimating this Nolander. I think he’s still less than twenty years old. It seems that the original legend is true. His Highness really looks like a young wizard. After being able to defeat Baalibali The person who hurts Black Usa again is more than enough. You don't want to think about it. He is seven or eight years younger than you, and the strength has reached this level. If he is as big as you, you will not be able to defeat you. Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Ma Zhuoya once again, looking at Richard's gaze became complicated. She approached Richard and leaned over to see if she was too thin for the barbaric standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Emine suddenly shocked his whole body and turned his head to look northeast. His eyes turned full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rama Zhuoya’s reaction was much slower than Eminem. After a moment, he suddenly realized what he was, and turned his head to look northeast, and she The expression was extremely frightened, and even the hair was erected for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has changed direction from northwest to northeast. Then the wind suddenly became bigger, and the long yellow grass was sloping. Looking down from the sky, you can see the long grass that is falling down like a huge wave, rolling in the direction of Eminem and Lama Zoya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
