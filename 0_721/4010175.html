			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the character of the Duke of Peter Peter, he could not stop Becky from going out in the future Looking for a lover, especially a lover, is from the Mensa family. In this case, he will find a way to die after he has given birth to the heir. This is also one of the tacit terms between Mensa and Schumpeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the greatest value of Qi Qi can be said to have been destroyed in the hands of Richard, although this can be said that she deliberately did, but Richard does not deny In this matter, I have gained a lot of money, at least very enjoyable, and the feeling of forcing her to get out of the night and last night is amazing. Even if there was a lot of memory missing last night, Richard could still recall the madness that she couldn't wait to smash her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although accepting Qi Qi will be able to resist her revenge against the next door and Xiong Peter. However, Richard has long been inseparable from these two families. He does not mind adding another hatred. If he is afraid, he will not kill Xiaomensa before, nor will he order Qiqi to take off his clothes as revenge. This is not related to whether she was at the scene or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why hesitating and repeating is actually Richard’s psychological factor. He always felt that since he brought him back, it seems that he is passive in every step, except for forcing her to undress. No, maybe after Richard won the battle for life and death, Qi Qi was ready for the next steps. Otherwise, how can she explain that she wants to go to the ectopic face twice and twice, and just happened to be in her study last night? If the latter result is considered, then the link to redeem the bet is within her plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of a deep-minded woman, but he is very mindful of being depressed in front of a woman. If it wasn’t for Qi Qi’s repeated challenge to Richard’s endurance bottom line, he would have a venting impulse in his heart. Even if he was drunk, Richard might not do anything to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard sighed, and this is the end of the matter. I don’t think it will be useful anymore. He is not a person who has not taken responsibility. It is just a negligible burden to have one more. In fact, the heavy or negative responsibility depends on the weight of the other party in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still early, Richard called a maid and asked her to send a new suit to Qi Qi and walked to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a mess in the study room last night, empty bottles are thrown everywhere, the wine glasses are lying on the floor. The traces of last night's war were still faintly visible on the floor. This study is not allowed by Richard, and ordinary waiters are not allowed to enter at will. So all the traces are still there, and there is a bottle of half empty bottle on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the middle of the study room and shook his head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looked at the desk and vaguely remembered that he had written a lot of things on a piece of paper last night. But now the magic pen is still on the desk, and the piece of paper in memory disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Richard, trying to remember, clearly remember that there is such a piece of paper, but where did it go? The traces in the room indicate that no waiter has come in privately, and if there is a thief, there is no reason to let go of the magic pen on the table, and steal a piece of paper that is just graffiti. As long as some people with magical knowledge can see that the magic pen is at least a legendary item. Moreover, the study of the Archbishop of Archimonde will enter the thief, which was something that the family had never had before in the most difficult time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe really drink too much, haven’t you ever left a graffiti? Richard finally had to think like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came back this time, he left Niris and Agamemnon with information. So when Richard called the waiter to clean the study, the old butler knew that Richard had gotten up, and hurried to give Niris's reply to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is still a few words, but it can be seen from the lines that the four emperors have a good mood recently. He invited Richard to have lunch, and inquired by the way of expectation. A look at the latest configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter, Li knew that the time was still abundant, so he indulged and asked the old housekeeper: "What is Qi Qi?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler smiled and said: "I think she has no threat to Archimonde, so she made her own claim and let her move freely on the floating island. Now look, the family There are a lot of people who like her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "Do you think she has no threat?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. How can an eight-level magician threaten Archimonde?" The old butler's plausible answer made Richard very helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee frowned and said, "But the scope of her activities is too great! Last night..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler smiled and said: "I think she made a major contribution to the Archimonde family last night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard's expression became very weird, saying: "Do you think? Contribution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, contribution!" said the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha couldn’t help but lick his head and know that he couldn’t change the long-established concept of this stubborn and loyal old man. He could only sigh. "Okay! Let's arrange it. I have to meet the four emperors at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the lunch is still in the hotel that can provide many rare ingredients. Still in the first time Richard met the box of Nyris and Agamemnon. Four emperors and Agamemnon have long been waiting, but this time Richard also brought Faschi. This beautiful woman is responsible for carrying the enchant box. The box is worth three million dollars. Even in the floating world, it is inevitable that someone will be red-eyed, take risks, or put a black hand and blame others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is the same as last time, Nyris is still eating and saying, the first time I saw Faschi and Richard of the Four Emperors The same, I was so stunned that I had forgotten to eat things for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon is silent and only responsible for eating. After Richard’s last loss, this time, of course, he will not make the same mistake again. He trained in dark blue, the amount of food and the speed of eating are equally good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men are very unconventional, and there is no chance to leave Fasqi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is as excited as water, constantly rushing to Richard. In this way, Nyris immediately exuded the amazing charm, and even compared Fasqi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi has long been stunned, and Richard’s gaze at Nyris’s burning eyes is also very unnatural, and the frequency of eating is not known. It's a lot slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon suddenly said: "This guy just paid off his debt, so he is overexcited. Don't delay eating!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly became cheerful and continued to bury his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing to talk about is the style of Faschi, so only she suffers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sweeping away the things on the table, the three men began to talk about business, and at this time Faschi only ate half full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard couldn’t see the past, called the waiter, and gave Faschi a table of dishes, so that the big beauty looked better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing Neris smile almost like a swaying face and Agamemnon’s smile, Richard suddenly understood, these two The guys originally intended to do so, so that he had the opportunity to show up in front of Faschi. Of course, the price of this performance is thousands of gold coins. However, for such a beautiful woman with good military strength, this price is nothing, and countless people are willing to have such a good opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some strange feelings. Actually, without knowing it, it seems that he has a tacit understanding with these two guys, but they have not dealt with each other for a few times. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men left Faschi alone to deal with the new table, and began to discuss the business. Faschi sat in his heart and put it down and began to eat. The strong who can cultivate to her level naturally know that these ingredients are good for the body to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for face and dignity, what is it? To put it bluntly, it was the three men who threw those things away first, which caused the situation that she was chewing on her own table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee handed the box to Niris. Nyris opened the magic box and examined each structure in detail. After spending half an hour, he said with a surprise: "The addition of the structure is a little higher than the last time. God, how long is this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "It has been more than four months in the Faro plane." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s only four months!" Nyris screamed exaggeratedly, and leaned back on Richard, saying: "Other constructions." If you want to increase the build-up of the assembly, the time of use must be calculated in five years or even ten years! How long have you been using it, four months. God! I don’t think it will take long before you can do it. It can be used for the best of composite construction! You know, a few years ago, there was an excellent initial agility in an auction. It is completely unimaginable. Its addition rate can actually be higher than the normal initial stage. Agile is even higher, chasing the second-order agile! That structure is simply a legend, and the price is on the spot, which is much more expensive than the three sets you gave me. That is simply a piece of art. Richard! I think that if you continue to progress like this, it is possible to make such a legendary structure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察张I opened my mouth and sent out a few unintentional notes from my throat. Finally I only said one sentence: "I fight for... no retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Nyres took a heavy shot of Richard's shoulder and said with awkwardness: "As a man, how can you be so courageous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the four emperors Angry, but fascinating, eye-flowing, noble and charming coexist, just more women than women! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi is burying his head and eating it, suddenly squirting out a soup!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three men All of her gaze was concentrated on her, and she was so angry and ignorant that she had gently lifted her right foot. With her strength, as long as one foot down, you can wear the floor and let yourself wear to the next level, thus avoiding the sight of these three hateful men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
