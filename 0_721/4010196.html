When I am excited, I will show the old bottom. I can see if you can sleep in the next week."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Black Gold took out the list sent by Richard, at the very top of the list, it was the cracking and improvement of the Faro's dwarf gunpowder formula. On this item, Richard suggested that if he completed it in a Noland month, he would be willing to pay an additional 200,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deducted 50,000 gold coins lost by Black Gold, and he also had 150,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf’s face showed a painful struggle, and finally sighed heavily, took out the income account belonging to the dark blue, and wrote down the fourteen Ten thousand nine hundred and nine hundred this number. While writing, the Grey Dwarf whispered, "Your Highness! Your most loyal financial executive has only one hundred gold coins this month. If you go on like this, your servants will be hungry..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Night’s night is coming again. At dusk, the soldiers all withdrew to the city. The rock that was too late to be transported was thrown on the ground as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenson’s night is especially dangerous, the elves will greatly increase their power in the evening and add a new arrow skill. Their arrows will become as fascinating as ghosts. So when Druid drove the forest to walk, Lina never organized the soldiers to stop, but chose the stupid way to cut off during the day. The arrows of the elves attacked the night, except for the strong men such as Richard and Lina, the ordinary soldiers and officers could not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of arrow is only effective in the forest. Once out of the forest, the power is not as good as the ordinary shooting. If the elf shot to the city is also such a magical arrow, Lina has long been beaten back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest that walks gradually emerges deep in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat in a clearing, inspiring the structure of the forest, sitting calmly. He did not bring the fate of the twins, the weapon was only the nameless elf knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been integrated into the forest, but he carefully did not approach any of the trees in the forest, but chose to sit on a side of the bush on. Trees are the partners of the Green Sen. Who knows which tree that looks inconspicuous is actually the eyes of the Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the distance, the water is crouching on the ground, like a wolf waiting to hunt. Twilight gave up the cloak, dug a shallow pit on the ground and buried himself half. Splash in the training camp has become accustomed to the darkness and the forest, the twilight is also a hidden talent, Richard is confident that they can pass Druid's eyes and ears. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are separated by a few kilometers. Here is the data that Richard found based on the walking forest in a month, and calculated the range of areas where Druid is most likely to hide. At least the area where they may pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon is waiting there in another area where Druid may appear. This guy who is reluctant to say that he is a man has no problem, that is no problem, although Richard has not seen him fully shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a few areas, but there are no suitable candidates. Lina's breath elves are too familiar, and Nyris is good, it is not easy to hold back, especially in recent times, the mind is restless, not suitable for lurking. As for Schell and the great Magister Pamir, they have no talent in hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar in the forest, and an old tree ran across the trees. The forest that walked has appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest under the night, several agile figures are also jumping forward, they leap from one tree to another, pupils under the night Shoot a light green glow. The swept figure cleverly blends with the deep and shallow color of the forest, and the average creature can barely see them by sight alone. The forest under the night is their natural battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat there and did not move. Hunters are most sensitive to moving objects, and are often overlooked for stationary objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been sitting in the forest for a whole few hours. After such a long time, his strange atmosphere has merged with the surrounding environment. Will not be discerned by perception. Now if you want to find out, you can use large-scale detection magic, or just look directly at your eyes. However, Richard himself is a person who perceives excellence. It is clear that the more sensitive the person is, the more often the vision becomes a blind spot, and the eye becomes more a tool for capturing dynamic prey. In extreme cases, even if Richard is sitting at his feet, he will turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, Druids are all keenly aware guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forests that have been walking have left, and after a while, the tremors of the earth have ceased. They walked out of the forest, reached their destination, and laid roots on the blank felled ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is still motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be dead all around, and several shadows in the canopy pass quickly and disappear into the depths of the forest. The elf warriors came and went like the wind, and they were silent. In the night, their actual combat power will be multiplied. Until the elf warrior disappeared for a long time, Richard was still sitting still, breathing became nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another half an hour, Richard suddenly opened his eyes, and his eyes flashed in the night with a dark blue light! A few hundred meters away, a group of flowing shadows suddenly stopped. When it stops, it is almost completely invisible. When moving, it can be seen from the flowing light and shadow that the outline of a cheetah flashes. The cheetah turned his head and glanced in the direction of Richard, and immediately the neck was upright! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its pupil, Richard’s lips were slightly open, and when he read the lip language, it immediately spelled out the words of Richard: “Catch you!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved, and the dark, dark green that had been covered on his body was immediately torn apart. He grinned and showed a white tooth, stood up, raised the long-named elf knife, and strode to the invisible cheetah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheetah was first frightened, then revealed his canine teeth, roaring low and low, his eyes showing extreme hatred. It hesitated a bit, or turned around and ran to the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is already late, a hesitant time is enough for a lot of things to happen. A flash of lightning suddenly pierced the night sky, and when it fell, it was blown up on the cheetah! The cheetah was immediately blown out of the invisible state, and one fell to the ground, and the pain was lingering. He struggled to roll a few laps, and a green light flashed across the body, and the person stood up, then changed shape and turned into a handsome boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the green light flashed, the aftermath of the lightning on the boy has disappeared. He turned back and stared at Richard with great grievances, but his eyes suddenly collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is actually less than a hundred meters away from him, and is flying at an incredible speed, even faster than the Elf Warrior under the night Be quicker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
