			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the emperor has surrounded the 3,000 people of Richard If you look at it from a high altitude, the army of the deep red Principality is like a reef, and the emperor is like a black wave, constantly picking up one after another, slamming on the reef, every wave After the whistling, it will provoke a piece of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emperor, a general is waving a long sword, commanding the soldiers to launch a wave of attacks, just then, one The humanoid knight suddenly rushed out of the front line and slammed into the emperor's squad. In an instant, his body and his majesty horse were penetrated by more than ten weapons, but the humanoid knight seemed to feel no pain at all, still struggling forward. Even with a knife and a gun rushed to the general, smashing a long gun into the general's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humanoid knight has fallen into the encirclement of the emperor’s overlapping stacks, and various weapons are constantly falling and falling, and a piece of flesh and blood is placed on him. Only a few of his body and body became a skeleton, but the humanoid knight was unaware of it, but only focused on turning the rifle in his hand, trying to expand the wound on the chest of the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar scenes are constantly being staged, both sides have already killed their eyes, and a short-lived hedge has consumed 77.8 times of physical exhaustion, all relying on strict The instinct brought by training is in a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this battle, the advantage of the Crimson Principality in equipment has emerged. The border guards have always been regarded as the core of the first line, and they are given priority in equipment. The value of a full set of ordinary warriors is more than a hundred gold coins, and the standard equipment of the Emperor's infantry is less than 30 gold coins. The huge difference in value is directly reflected in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Infantry must be able to pierce the armor of the Crimson Principality with a full blow, but the piercing is not very deep, only two or three times It will cause fatal wounds, and their swords will pierce the armor three or four times. There will be a curling edge between the rubbing, and it will be very difficult to break the armor. The deep red Principality fighters can fully penetrate the imperial system. Armor, their swords will pierce more than ten armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emperor’s warriors, a blue line of fire will appear from time to time. This line of fire floats in the air, about ten meters long, and all the soldiers who hit it. They will be ignited immediately, and each fire line will ignite several soldiers before they will disappear. The fire line often appears in the most critical place, which can alleviate the situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the middle of the warrior, Richard wiped the sweat from his forehead and poured a bottle of extremely powerful mana to restore the potion. This felt better. At this time, the emperor who died under his magic was near. Two thousand people, but compared with the total number of enemies of up to 50,000, this amount is only a small part that can be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Emperor’s ** has become more gradual, and Richard has begun to feel heavy pressure. The soldiers of the Deep Red Principality have already died five hundred. After the rest of the people, the disadvantages began to appear gradually. Richard’s internal body was like a fire, and the feeling of magical dryness was always so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this large-scale battlefield, the lethality of magic is far more than a single-handed sword, although the partial command intention of Salenwell is obvious Wrap the battle line between the two sides to prevent Richard from magnifying the range to kill the magic, but Richard seems to always find a perfect angle to wedge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the number of emperors is too much, and Richard has a high-level magic in the past, killing hundreds of enemies at most once, if there are enough Time, Richard may be able to slowly kill the 50,000 soldiers, but now Richard has no time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking the mana potion, Richard gasped for a moment, waiting for the effect of the potion to come out, raising the fate of the twins, laying two in the most critical part of the front line. The blue fire line ignited more than ten Imperial cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly stabilized the battle, Richard has noticed that the attack of the Emperor is getting more and more layered and rhythm, one after another, let the soldiers Exhausted, all this, naturally stems from the command of Salenwell, for a long time no see, this man has become more suffocating, and knows how to use the pair to expand the advantage of the party a little, that is, he changed It is even more deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the gap between Faro and Noland is comprehensive and irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows slowly erected and suddenly shouted: "No face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li There seems to be a constraint between the inspection and the no-face, but this constraint sometimes exists, and sometimes it does not seem to exist, so that there is no way for Richard to give orders without face, but after he screams, his body flashes instantly. A golden light, the effects of war madmen have been blessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No face, guard the front for me." Richard yelled, he didn't know where the face was now, he could only blindly scream, Anyway, countless times have proved that no face is always heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was such a distraction, a gray-black feather arrow flew silently, shot into Richard's midfielder, Richard snorted, his golden light flashed, the feather arrow had appeared, the waist The wound immediately gathered, and Richard did not pay attention to the attack on his own town, but a whistling, the whole body radiated, if a golden meteor, far away from the direction of Salenwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless magics and sharp arrows falling on Richard, and they are all bounced off by the golden light of the layer of protection, even if it is a big magician or a strong country. No exception, a big magister, after his only nine-level magic turned out to be skewed, shouted: "Legend,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out, the entire battlefield was quiet for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend, in Faro, is a too powerful term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer dodging, but rushes straight to Salenville, and now the magical defense of Raytheon has been achieved on his body. All the magical and physical attacks that come in are a joke in front of his eyes, and whatever he dares to block in front of him, he will be instantly burned to the ashes by the blue fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, Richard has fallen to the side of Allenville, reaching out for a shot in his battle, the horse with World of Warcraft suddenly turned into Ashes, and Allenville fell unharmed, and Richard reached out and grabbed his collar, and put him in the air, and said, "Let your army surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell sneered, suddenly used the sound of the magic, shouted: "Execute my order, the final order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The generals looked over at the same time, and the eyes were all complicated. Richard’s heart sank slightly, because he saw some very familiar things from the eyes of these generals. It was something called determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general suddenly roared: "Kill, kill the crimson bastard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of the film are coming and going, the generals are like crazy, one by one crossed the ordinary warriors, pounced on the defense line of the deep red duchy, blood In the dead war, they fell one by one, and they were filled up again. They saw that the generals were so fearless and dead. The eyes of the imperial warriors were all red, and the beasts of the beasts screamed at the warriors of the deep red dusk. They went back to a more hoarse roar and blocked the emperor’s offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's face turned cold, and he lifted himself up to the tens of meters of air, and reached out to the battlefield with a finger and a stroke. A tens of meters of blue fire line appeared out of thin air, surrounded by one side. Before the precarious front, the imperial warrior was kept out, and then his figure flashed on the battlefield. Every time it flashed, it would appear beside a mage or a strong man. The long knife brought out a magnificent The trembling moonlight will pass through the hearts of these people every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, there are more than a dozen mages and strong men who have fallen in the hands of Richard, and one time the battlefield is one of the clear, the emperor’s side The strong no longer dared to take off the air, above the sky, only Richard and the Rachel in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the battlefield below, Richard suddenly had an unreal feeling, as if the people who killed and killed below did not exist, what he saw now, What I experienced is only a dream, and in the next moment, there is another kind of violent rise from the bottom of my heart, to destroy all the creatures below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s ear suddenly sounded a faceless voice: “I should have done it, and it will be dangerous to stay. It's not the content of our original agreement, so I will leave for a while, and you will play slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is falling, Richard knows that no face has been quietly far Going and leaving the battlefield, as to which direction she left, even Richard, who is blessed with war madness, can't tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't surrender," Richard swayed Sharonwell in his hand and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salenwell closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes are cold, no longer questioning, but the figure flashes, once again out of the void and hidden, the long knife in his hand always swings out The knives and knives, each knives flashed, and there will be a general who commanded the soldiers to attack and fell down, or a mage or a strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is sometimes flying high for dozens of meters and sprinkling a large blue fire. These flames containing real powers are enough to cover tens of meters when they fall to the ground. The area of ​​the square is not as powerful as the fire line that was burned before. The slightly stronger fighters will not be burned to death, but they will be seriously injured, but let them lose their fighting power, and the goal is achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
