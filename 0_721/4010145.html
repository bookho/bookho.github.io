			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of sacrifice, Richard can inspire a power that far exceeds normal levels Magic. The power of this magic is enough to reach several times the normal level of magic, and the price is that the magic of releasing this magic permanently disappears from the body of Richard. That is to say, if Richard releases three six-level magic in the state of sacrifice, his magic level will return to the eleventh level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ability that is not at a critical juncture and cannot be easily used. This ability is very consistent with the characteristics of Akmon's blood, crazy, decisive, and does not leave the way. But Richard stared at the symbol on his wrist, but there was another thought in his heart. This is a very crazy idea. With the blood of the elves and the inheritance of deep blue meditation, the magic grows several times faster than the average magician. Even if he keeps the normal wizard's promotion speed and sacrifice, he can use it once a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey of magic is endless, and the more Richard is going deeper, the more he realizes the horror of those who are in front. Su Hailun, Modred, White Night, and even Gotton, Richard now has a feeling that the gap between them has not been shortened, but has expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pull the gap with them, Richard can't be all-inclusive, can only choose to take a more extreme path. The sacrifice, just in line with Richard's choice, is that killing first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of Noland, it is still the day of the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Richard finally recovered most of his status, so he took Gangde and several guards and set off for the Eternal Dragon Hall. The quicksand was already ready, and Richard was not the first to sacrifice, so the ceremony was soon started. The list of gods at this ceremony has finally returned to normal, and Richard only saw three options. In addition to the options he wanted to enhance the plane channel, one was a time-like grace, giving Richard an extra life of eight years, and the last one was a legendary lava ring. This ring can greatly increase the magic damage, especially the flame magic, in addition to the magical increase. The lava ring made Richard quite a heart, but eventually chose to strengthen the plane channel. He now frequently travels between Faro and Noland, and the sooner he strengthens the plane channel, the more he will benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has another consideration. The people who are now loyal to Richard are basically in Farory, the mother nest is in Faro, and in the future, in order to enhance the power. He also needs to bring the army out of Faro. With a small accumulation, the reduction in the transmission cost of the plane channel is particularly important. This is the sooner the gain, the greater the benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard selected the grace, the sacrifice ceremony soon ended, and the cost of a single plane transfer between Faro fell from 20,000 Up to 15,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the process of sacrifice, sometimes the power of light is wrapped around the string of the beasts of Richard, and the largest beast on the bracelet of the beast is Constantly radiating high heat and rejecting all the power of time. This once again reminded Richard of the speciality of this animal tooth bracelet, reminding him of the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after the ceremony, Richard sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The sand flowing next to it, the amber eyes are full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, good." Seeing that Richard is unwilling to answer, The quicksand did not ask again, but asked his own necklace to look at Richard: "Look, my drip necklace has been strengthened. Now it is called a spring necklace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard knows that the dripping necklace is part of the reincarnation suit, and now it is strengthened to the spring water necklace. The main enhancement is the increase in divine power and the increase in the magical effect. This is also the most practical and effective improvement, which can increase the magical effect of quicksand by 10%. Hosting a sacrifice will always yield a certain grace. It seems that the sand is used to strengthen the drip necklace. The effect of the current spring necklace theory is close to the legendary item, but in the hands of the sand with the book of Time, it can exert its effectiveness far beyond the ordinary priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not look at the properties of the spring water necklace in detail, but took a step back and looked at it for a while before he smiled and said, "It’s a good match for you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an answer to the accident of flowing sand. She stunned, but did not laugh, but leaned on Richard’s arms and closed her eyes. Through the chest, she can hear Richard's powerful heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, this moment is very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not long after, the quicksand took the initiative to break the silence and whispered, "When do you leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Tomorrow at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." At this moment, the sand does not want to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard left the Eternal Dragon Hall. Every time I stay in Noland is very short and busy. Soon after returning to the floating island, a waiter suddenly hurriedly rushed into Richard's study and said in a panic: "Young Master Richard! It's not good. The young Master Wennington has a conflict with the people in Fused, and now he has been detained by the other side. "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Richard’s first reaction was that the attendant must have made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aqmond is no longer a decline, but also one of the fourteenth floating gates. How can I be bullied to this point when I have just been promoted to the Royal Architect? Who dares to do this? What's more, Richard is very familiar with Winnington's character. This young man of the same age is very calm and will not make any extraordinary things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant said anxiously: "The young Master Wennington is in conflict with the younger son of the Mensa family. The other party deducted the young master and said that he was going to the duel. Going to the field. Master Li, the young Master Wennington was very hurt and could not be delayed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mensa?" Hearing the name, Richard instead Calm down and say, "Take the details before and after."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This servant has been following Winnington for seven or eight years, against Wenning. I have always been faithful. Despite his eagerness, he also knew that this matter was very important, so he endured the anxiety in his heart and told the story again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after a very simple, Winnington purchased the raw materials needed in the faucet, and the result was the younger son of the Duke of Mensa. The family of both sides is already a bloody enemy that cannot be resolved. Therefore, it is always inevitable that the road will be smashed after the encounter. I just didn't know that Mensa's youngest son said something in Wennington's ear. Wennington, who had always been calm, suddenly became angry and screamed on the spot of the son of Mensa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of Xiaomensa have been cut off, and that’s it. The most important thing is that many people saw it as Winnington’s first move. The hand, and the level of hands-on has been fully qualified for a duel. In the end, Winnington, who only brought a few ordinary attendants, was seriously injured on the spot by the Mensa family. He was also detained by the small door and held in a hotel next to the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaomen Sayan said that either Archimonde would find a way to bring people back, or they would fight with Wennington in the duel. Once in the duel, life and death can not interfere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duel escape is the greatest shame of the nobility. Many nobles regard honor as something more important than life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush, but thought for a while before he said indifferently: "So, the purpose of Xiaomensa is not Winnington. So he won't have anything for a while, Xiaomensa just wants to bring other people out through Winnington. It seems that this person can only be me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The attendant did not dare to plug in. Although he is worried about Winnington, he knows what to say at this time, but may have unpredictable effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped the table and said after a moment: "What did Xiaomen Sa and Winnington say?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant did not dare to conceal, saying: "I just heard a little bit, it seems to be related to Miss Venica."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant immediately leaves Go, after a while, bring Vinica to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first waved the waiter to leave, then closed the door of the study, and then looked at Vinica, the half-sister. Under Richard's gaze, Venica looked a bit unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked calm, his left hand fingers continually squirming, and then said faintly: "Winnington was severely injured by the small door, now Was locked in the hotel on the side of the duel. According to the attendant, Xiaomensa said something about you in Wennington's ear, Wennington lost his calmness, first smashed the small door Sa. Now, you have What do you want to say to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Vinica turned pale and couldn't speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing her like this, Richard knew what was going to happen, so he added some tone and said: "Although I think Xiaomensa is directed at I have come, Winnington should have nothing to do for a while. But after a long time, any changes can happen. You should cherish some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a week ago..." Venica said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the floating world, the young and energetic Venica was angered by the grandson of the Duke of Mensa, and had a secret gamble with the other. Both sides are nine-level fighters. The difference is that Vinica has the ability to have blood. She had absolute confidence to win, but she did not expect the other to be equipped with two epic-level equipment. Veneca, who has only one fine weapon in his hand, naturally does not need to mention it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s eyes twitched slightly and asked: “What about bets?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vinica's face was pale, apparently remembering the day's business, hesitatingly said: "If Currie Mensa loses, he will insult his father in the square of Faustian and apologize in public. I lost... I will, I will take it off and show it to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, what happened next?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Xiaomensa and Winnington said that it should be you. The characteristics of a certain part of the body, this irritated him." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
