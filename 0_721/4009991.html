			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worker bees are units that were born when the nest was born, because the nest is always Create combat units, so the first few worker bees have never been created since they died. The upgraded worker bees, in addition to being larger and faster, add an additional storage function similar to the insect worker bee. They can eat food, break down into nutrient-rich beeswax in the body and store it, then return to the nest and feed it to the nest. As a result, the problem of eating in the nest is largely solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And creating your own combat units is a new set of basic elements that can be combined by Richard. A special ability allows Richard to design new units based on the current situation. However, each new design is designed to consume more than the arms of the Brood Soul. It requires the magic of 70 Magic Crystals to complete. The average five-level ability is only 50 magic crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and finally decided to start trying to create new arms. The energy of about 90 magic crystals is stored in the mother's nest and should be enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the morphological choice, which provides dozens of various forms, except for a few strange forms similar to insects, the rest seem to be the mother's nest. Creatures that have been eaten, including cave dwellings, goblins, lizards, and so on. Richard did not hesitate to choose the human form. The biggest benefit of this form is that it does not explain the source of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Richard chose a hand for the human form, not a weapon like a paw. The ability to attach to the enhanced defense, this ability allows the created soldiers to have a layer of keratinous tissue similar to lizard skin under normal skin, equivalent to a natural layer of leather. The second and third abilities have intensified the speed and strength, so that the overall quality of the warriors and barbarians created have not been much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard also chose to strengthen the intelligence and energy storage organs. Now the new arms can be the same as the throwing soldiers. There is an organ in the body that reserves food energy. You can maintain a week of survival after eating a meal. This does not have to say much about the military's mobility and logistical support. Strengthening intelligence allows them to learn to use more and more sophisticated weapons and to accumulate combat experience. Although the combat units created by the hens cannot be upgraded like real fighters, the veterans and inexperienced rookies still differ in combat effectiveness. Especially in the case of sea tactics, it may even show a gap in the number of levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly created arms were named by the mother nest as a primary reinforcement fighter of the Terran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have eight levels of combat power since they were created. If they are equipped with weapons armor as in the case of Richard, they can reach level 9. After a period of training and fighting, the combat power may even approach the sealed knight, but it is impossible to lead the troops on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the strength of the new arms, the fifth-order hen can only create three fighters a day. Compared with the adult strong barbarian warrior, the new warrior is still slightly worse. But Richard is quite satisfied, and they are natural troops. Once they become a scale, their strength will definitely exceed that of the same number of barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed the mother to create a week of worker bees, and then to create a primary intensive warrior, Richard led the army to begin deep bloodshed. The red color of the blood-stained land is now much more pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon the next day, two giant bats, only the size of a horse, flew from the air, flew straight to Richard, and after a few turns around him, He landed successively and hung on both sides of his horse. Richard's horse immediately became frightened, until Richard released a spell to appease the animal to calm it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stretched out a bat and observed it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bat is several times larger than a normal bat, with two long fangs on its lips. The common blood-sucking bat is gray-black, and its coat color is dark black, and several scarlet blood lines extend from the top of the head to the hind paws, which is particularly embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite bats have much higher wisdom than ordinary Warcraft, they can be regarded as the intelligent life of the bat's appearance, so when Richard mentions them, Both contracted the two hind paws and took back the fangs. Their claws and teeth are highly toxic and the most powerful weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very pleased with the elite bat, waved it into the air, and then the elite bat flew away, flying around the 30-kilometer range With. After a while, one will come back to rest, and the other will fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the next day, two elite bats arrived. Now, Richard’s observations on the surroundings are much stricter, and he is supplemented by more than a dozen wind teeth, and there is almost no possibility of being attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, a bat that was bigger than the elite bat caught up with Richard’s team. There is a pair of small blood red eyes on its head, which is the source of its night vision ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has great confidence in the trip to the blood-stained place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not eager to rush to the blue water oasis, but some aimless wandering around the oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently encountering goals, conducting several training and warm-up exercises before the war. It is not necessarily the poisonous Miqila designated by Amman. Other horses can also be used. If it is a caravan, if it is related to the red songs, Richard does not mind making a small fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is originally a world of chaos and bloodthirsty. After Sinclair broke the balance, it is now completely a ruleless, no law. world. It is necessary to wait until a new balance is established in the pool of blood to restore order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other caravans will also bring intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Heim will never stop doing this, and the army he assembled cannot wait for himself to return to the territory, nor can he do nothing. Go back and disband. In that case, it is not only Him, but the deer of the deer, Yatu, will lose face. Therefore, this army will eventually track itself into the blood-stained area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he comes in, Richard is not prepared to let them go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War is the source of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly created Terran Junior Warrior is indeed powerful and fully reaches the level of the elite knights of the elite knights. However, the problem is still that the output is too small. The five-level new arms want to increase production and need to pay an extra 50 magic crystals. The only good news is that Magic Crystal is a quantity product in the Faro plane, which can be purchased with gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so leisurely to travel in the bloody land for two days, and the connection with the mother’s nest has become continual, indicating that the turbulent land is already fast It is three hundred kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone thought that the blood-stained land was a peaceful and beautiful land, the elite bat suddenly came up with a message, and there was a scale in front of Richard’s right front. Not a small armed caravan. Through the eyes of the elite bat, Richard saw the bloody flag flying above the caravan. It is the red Cossack caravan. Looking at the direction of the carnival and the formation of the caravan, it should be a caravan that crosses the bloody land and prepares to return to the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
