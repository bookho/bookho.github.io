If everything he said is true and can be restored to the strength of the great priest, it will be a major help to the development and growth of Richard. Seeing the eyes of Richard’s inquiry, the sands nodded and nodded. This was the meaning that helped Clark change his faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard’s mind was fixed and asked Clark the last question: “That is the last question now, what is your wish?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark was silent for a moment, his face was struggling and twisted, apparently remembering a lot of unfortunate past events. In the end, he took a sigh of relief and said, "I hope that the cardinal of the Highland God of War, Markville, will be burned on the firearm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a weak Waiting for the gods of divine power, the cardinal of the high gods of war is generally around the 16th level, but occasionally there will be fifteen levels of priests to join. Of course, the level is not the biggest problem. What matters is the identity of the cardinal and the execution of the firearm. Killing a cardinal by dealing with heresy, that means religious war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li asked, knowing that Markville, like Clark, was a seventeen-level grand priest. As for the grudges between Clark and Markville, it is not the focus of Richard. At present, it is only necessary to know that Clark’s wish and the eternal and timeless dragon do not violate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded to the sand, so Liu Sha said: "The Lord I serve is the eternal and time dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Clarke shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately realized his own grievances, but the name of the name given by the quicksand was so shocking that he could not restrain himself. If this is a real name of God, it means that this god is not a new god, but a power that is likely to be above the entire Faro plane and powerful to the incredible true God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark with "The Book of the Gods" has a thorough understanding of the gods of the Faro plane, knowing the rules of the Faro plane, not at all The name of eternal and time may appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the quicksand is telling the truth, then there is only one possibility left. It is impossible to lie in the sand, because it is meaningless to lie. When Clark converts, he can naturally perceive the information of the priests who serve the gods from the acquired power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Clark’s mouth twitched and the voice became dry: “Eternal and Time Dragon... is the god of ecstasy!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not an ectopic face, it is above a lot of planes." Flowing sand corrected him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark took a deep breath and said, "But this... there is no essential difference! You are all invaders from the alien plane!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, we do come from other planes. But except for us, none of the gods in this plane will accept you." The sand that I know is the result of this coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark closed his eyes in pain and his face was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was telling the truth about the sundial, or before he stepped into the door of Richard. I also envisioned the most bleak future path, including the possibility of following the new god to capture the godhead and even blasphemy. But truth is always more horrible than imagination. Powerful to incredible true God means that his wish is easier to achieve, but the ectopic invaders impact his worldview for decades. It is still difficult to make a real decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After struggling for a long time, Clark said: "It is true, I... willing to believe in the eternal and timeless dragon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, Clark leaned back on the seat back, sweat rushed from his body, and he was as weak as he had just had a serious illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand stood up and said calmly: "You will not be disappointed! Come with me, we can hold the ceremony now."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue for the ceremony was in the sand-sand room. The altar was just a wooden frame that was temporarily nailed into wood. The handwork was a bit rough. The assistants of the ceremony were the two fallen priests of Kas and Marvin, and the apprentice pastor Xisuo. The viewers only have Richard himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands put the book of time on the wooden frame, and then briefly introduce the teachings, priesthood, and grace of the dragon of eternal and time. In fact, the teachings of the Eternal and Time Dragon are very simple, and there is almost no specific doctrine. That is to say, there is no long-form monologue that is usually done to consolidate faith. The main content is concentrated on sacrifice and grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doctrine really made Clark feel an accident, but he felt the fascination that gradually emanated from the book of Time, and he immediately became serious. The world of Vientiane may be illusory, only the power of God is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melodious chanting of the flowing sand, the pale golden light flows down from the book of time as water. The flowing sand signaled Clark to go forward, then let him kneel in front of the book of Time, and stretch out his hands to meet the overflowing power. Clark was so excited that his body was shaking and he said yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pale golden light falls on Clark’s hands, it is like a waterfall that stirs up the golden water. Clarke was shocked all over the body. Immediately he felt the cold and metallic spirit of the gods rolling into the body, and the dry and cracked soul shouted, desperately trying to absorb the long-lost power. In the soul, the cracks in the wounds caused by the burning of the gods slowly began to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the divine power, the gray-black layer on Clark’s face faded, and the face like the old orange peel began to swell slightly, and many deep wrinkles Rise and smooth. The bones of his body are also squeaking and the body grows up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark is constantly being transformed by the power of the gods, and the level of the sorcerer is also increased accordingly. After a while, he has passed the tenth level, and there is no sign of stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand forehead has begun to see out the slight sweat, but she still keeps chanting the spell at a constant rhythm, controlling the book from the time. The power of time that overflowed poured into Clark's hands. This process is surprisingly long, but it is the most critical. Only this time, the promotion of Clark's magic level is the fastest. At the end of the ceremony, it is necessary to slowly accumulate the power of the same as the ordinary magician. So as long as Clark can absorb the power of time, the sand will persist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light gold power has gradually spread to Clark's waist, wrapping his entire upper body. In his clothes, he suddenly lit up a group of extremely dazzling pale golden light, and strongly pressed almost all the things in the room with a layer of pale gold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
