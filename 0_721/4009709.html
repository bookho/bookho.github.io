Heavy hitting the floor-to-ceiling windows, the ancient Danube glass, which is burned by the ancient law, shows its value of one thousand gold and one square meter. It stands still and does not seem to be a negligible bug. And Minnie was like a lifeless puppet, bounced back, and then fell to the ground, the forehead first landed. She fell to the ground and did not move. Only a stream of blood rushed from under the long hair, crawling on the smooth obsidian ground, like a strange soft creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Minnie moved, her hands groping on the ground, and finally struggled to prop up her upper body. The blood continually sheds from the hairline, dyes her half of her cheeks, and sticks her long hair to her face. Not only the forehead, but also the blood in her mouth and nostrils. Minnie felt the heat on her face and reached out and touched it. The result was blood. She rubbed her hand on the clothes, then tore off a skirt, wiped the blood on her face, and then bundled her hair, tied it with blood-stained cloth, and stood up with a sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson stood in the same place, his chest was undulating, the blood of the eyeballs disappeared, and the muscles squirmed under the skin, clenching The double fists are even more squeaky from time to time. The Dragon Warlock has a strong body, although it can not be compared with the real battle, but can beat the common Master in the fight. The shots under his anger are extraordinarily heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnie swayed to Stevenson and closed her eyes, waiting for another blow. Her white long skirt was still stained with large pieces of blood, and her half face was swollen, but her expression was still calm. From the beginning to the end, she did not sigh, because she knew that any screams and pleadings would only attract a heavier beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson jumped in the corner of his eye and suddenly reached for the neckline of her long skirt, tearing it hard, and the upper part of the dress suddenly split into two halves, then A tear of her underwear, so that her upper body was barely exposed. However, what appeared in front of his eyes was not a ** that could cause **. The skin that was originally white and delicate and full of youthfulness was covered with large and small smudges and bruises. It was astonishing, just like a quilt. The cracked jade carving vase was broken everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson looked, took a deep breath and closed his eyes. After a few minutes of quiet standing, he calmed down completely, except that the blood on the bottom of his eyes would not fade for a while, and the rest had returned to normal. He said to Minnie: "You shouldn't go to class in the first few days, and you will get a good injury here. When I will, I will call a magician to help you deal with the injury on your face."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Stevenson started to walk back and forth in the room. After a few dozen laps, he suddenly stopped, as if he was helping to make up his mind and waved hard. Fist, said: "It is time to solve all this! Then drag on, the situation may be completely irreparable! Minnie, wait for the injury on your face to deal with it, immediately go to Irene, now it is that little sister It’s time for the child to work! You know what to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini silently nodded, watching him wave his hand and there’s nothing else to say. Dragging the heavy body, trying to keep it steady, went into the bathroom and began to wash the blood on his body. And Stevenson was dressed neatly, then turned a huge ruby ​​ring on his finger. The gem suddenly gave off a dazzling glare, and then it went down. The magic message has penetrated through many obstacles and passed to every corner of the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the two lean men came to Stevenson. One is a warrior and the other is a divine master. They listened carefully to Stevenson's instructions, and the servants left immediately, and the sorcerer stayed and began to treat Minnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician crossed his chest with his hands and prayed to God with utmost devotion, then sang the mantra. The white light is as thick as water, flowing from his hands and spilling over Minnie's head. The light ran down the skin. When it passed, the wound was closed at a speed visible to the naked eye, the blood was dissipated, and even the edema gradually faded. Minnie’s wounds looked shocking. In fact, it was just a flesh wound and she could not use ‘strong treatment’. However, Stevenson was obviously very anxious and could not wait for her natural recovery. Therefore, the theologian also refused to take care of his own loss and successively applied three powerful treatments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the magical treatment, Minnie had only a forehead and could see some signs of injury. She knew what she should do now, didn't stop and rest, and put on the Master's robe, and left the living area of ​​Stevenson. The exhausted divine master also quietly left, so only Stevenson himself was left in the residential area. He seemed a little anxious, pacing back and forth, occasionally looking out of the floor-to-ceiling window and cursing the horrible weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the warrior came back and stood behind Stevenson and whispered: "Everything is ready, how do you act?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson gnawed his teeth and waved his hand to the front of the sky, and said: "Work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comrades of the battle, a look of sorrow, and quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fate of the day, many people’s fate has changed, and Richard has worked hard as always. In his view, the process leading to the peak is like climbing a rock while climbing, and it is necessary to go step by step. Every morning and evening, it’s a small step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard took a day of satisfaction and exhaustion and moved to his residential area. However, the metal door of the residential area was far away, and he suddenly heard the faint crying and snoring in the depths of the roadway next to him. The sound sounds familiar, and the precise talent immediately reminds Richard that it is the voice of Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene... This is an almost faint name, but I didn’t expect it to appear around. And it sounds like she is having trouble. Richard can't help but be a bit strange. Does anyone dare to make trouble here? The place where his residential area is located is very quiet, and the magical lights used for lighting in the public areas are also very dim and soft, which looks like a good place to happen. However, this vast area is actually divided into several residential areas. Except for Richard, they live with mages-level wizards, or grand aristocrats or even royal children. Therefore, the defense seems to be loose and tight. There is magic eye surveillance, there is no dead angle at all. If someone really wants to make trouble, they will find that a large number of law enforcement mages do not know where they come from, and they will become close together in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the cry came was a roadway on the left side, very deep, and it was transmitted from the corner. Richard could not see what happened. what. He frowned and immediately turned and walked quickly toward the lane. After bypassing the corner, Richard finally saw the source of the noisy, it was Irene, and there were three men who were obviously not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene stood behind a very burly strong man, a huge body enough to plug three girls. He grabbed the girl's wrists with a large palm and lifted her off the ground. Another tall and thin man stood on the side of his arms, his eyes continued to go up and down on Irene, always spinning around the chest and abdomen. In front of Irene stood a man with a cross-faced flesh, and her hands were constantly groping around her, like searching for body, but never leaving sensitive parts of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene couldn’t break free, she could only use her legs to kick the ball, but she was caught in the thigh by the man in front of him, kneeling down and kneeling down. I touched my legs and smiled and said, "I almost forgot, there are still many places where I can hide money! Come, let me see, you are so nervous, I don’t know how many gold coins are stuffed in it. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
