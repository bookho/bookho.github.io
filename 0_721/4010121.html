			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler said: "Achilles adults said that the plane war has been At the most critical time, and the situation is not very smooth. So it is not possible to give feedback to the family. If possible, Achilles hopes that the family can support a group of enchanted arrows. In the defensive battle, the arrow is very expensive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie's face changed slightly, just nodded and asked: "What about Lina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper hesitated a moment and said: "The Master of the Dragon Master is in a deadlock in the Greenson plane and can only maintain the situation. She hopes to support her as quickly as possible when you have spare time. Master Na also confessed to me. If the young master doesn't seem to be rich, don't tell you this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard fell into meditation, fingers Keep tapping the table. Unexpectedly, Gordon did not leave him with too many resources, but instead dropped all the mess. All the private planes are not good news. Even if it seems to be the most normal Shulan, Gordon has only occupied two-fifths of the area, but the rest of the Shulan plane has been integrated into a whole. Only Senma is stationed, and it is difficult to maintain the situation. . And Hughland is very small, maybe not even one percent of Faro. If you put it in Noland, it is just a big island. Such a plane is fully developed and it is difficult to generate too much revenue. Other planes are in need of support. The original richest gamma plane was in the hands of the boxing fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now unclear, and the reinforcements that Achilles needs are true or false. And Lina’s life is not good, but it is ok. He also visited the Greenson plane and was impressed by the humid climate, the weird forests and the ferocious indigenous people. For a time, Richard only felt that everything was in jeopardy and that money was needed everywhere. The resources in his hands are extremely limited. If one fails, the situation may react in a chain and collapse completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is no wonder that Gordon is almost a self-made, and in a short period of time, it has created a great foundation in a storm-like situation, and the foundation must be extremely shallow. He has always supported the situation with constant expansion. It is like building a castle on the beach, and it will build a magnificent fortress very quickly, but if you are not careful, it may collapse completely. Now Archimonde, like all upstarts, lacks the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying stuff is manifested in every aspect. Generals, talents, the military, financial resources and rare resources are all part of the heritage. Richard's own followers have not yet grown up, and the five knights left by Gordon are clearly only the minimum need to stabilize the situation. If there are few, then even the defense can't keep it. After the chaos of the floating island, the former Gordon, who was trained for the long-term plan, lost two-thirds of his time. So now Richard found that in addition to being able to earn some money, there is almost no resources available on hand. But the war was the money. Richard just wanted to arm a 500-strong elite army in Faro and spent more than two million gold coins. He is a builder himself. As a result, his followers are not even a knight. Of course, from the current situation, the five hundred elite help for Richard is much larger than the three builders. However, if you want to focus on the long-term, the knight is the best choice to fight against the high-end strength of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Cavaliers are not as strong as the top players in the plane, they are winning a lot. In the case where the ranks are not much different, the quantity will occupy an absolute position. For example, under normal circumstances, three or four of the four-fourth-level warrior knights run a sixteen-level Faro sanctuary, and the problem is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, eventually Richard did not come up with a good way. No money is no money, and Richard can't change gold coins out of thin air. In fact, he still owes two sets of Nyris suits. The 1.5 million shields and nails are exchanged for prepaid materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard waved his hand at the old housekeeper and said, "Okay, I know. You should go ahead and let the knights prepare for it. They will leave tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old butler left, Richard took out a box of magic, touched it silently, and then pushed it to Faschi and said, "This is for Ellie."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi smiles like a flower, picks up the box and opens it and says, "Gift for the Earl's adult? Let me guess what it is, it won't be a decoration." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she opened the box and saw the five-piece structure placed neatly inside, she could not help but hold her breath. Faschi's face became serious, and he carefully read the structure and said: "It is a wild blow. Very good, you only owe the seven sets of the Earl of the Earl. I want to give this to the Earl. Send it, what are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have time, help me pick up ten people from the floating island. I will come back next time. I’m going to take it away. Also, has Ellie’s trouble lately, and it’s very anxious to see you. Isn’t she going to be such a knight?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A piece of fine iron vein was found not far from the land of the Earl's adult. It was originally a barren mountain without an owner. But now the mine is different, and the surrounding aristocrats claim sovereignty over this mountain. It includes the four counts of the sacred dynasty and a marquis of the Allies, and of course Alize is also among them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed trouble. "Licha frowned slightly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involved in the trouble of the two words of the land of no land and rich mineral deposits, the only way to solve it is war. Even if you don’t fight now, you will always have to fight later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Faschi, Richard remembered the list of Agamemnon, so he opened the record scroll and looked at it carefully. There are long lists on the reels. There are hundreds of items in large and small sizes, and the amount of each item is quite large. It seems that Agamemnon has a low status in the family. However, the price of this item made Richard very surprised. The price given by Agamemnon is only less than the market value of Norland, which is not far from the cost of normal merchants. In contrast, the price offered by Nyris can be much lower. Agamemnon and Nyris often appear together, almost inseparable. Agamemnon may not know the price of Nyris, how can he give himself such a list? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the palace, Nyris is standing at Philip’s desk and handing a piece of magic paper on his scalp. The emperor struggled to move the fat body, took the paper and saw that it was applying for a provisional budget, but the number of applications was to exhaust Neris' extra authority this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor put the paper on the table and said quietly: "Nyris, you should know that applying for so many temporary credits has a great impact on you." Big, the budget you get next year will not increase, and there will be no more power to apply for the provisional budget throughout the year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but I Has promised Richard!" Neris said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect him to have so much at once?" Philippe smiled intently and then signed his name on the application. Said: "Look at this, Richard's little guy is developing much faster than I expected. Well, this is your application, take it to the warehouse to adjust things. The promised thing must be done This time, it will be a lesson for you. Before you commit, let's measure your strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
