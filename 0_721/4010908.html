If If you use Raytheon for these damn long ears, then the recoil is damn, has my eyes spent? Their power is so big? Is this still a jīng spirit? Don't tell me they are not silver moon jīng spirit!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not silver moon jīngling"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old black gold is not so good to lie ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are they jīng spirits, isn't it important?" Richard said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold said: "Forget it, this is not my business anyway. Since those damn long ears are used, then the power of the single hair Slightly reduce a little, but the speed of shè is increased, so the lethality per unit time will not be reduced, and the long ears will not be hurt. This change is easy. Another?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be big, big enough, don't worry about recoil." As a result, Richard quickly sketched the image of the Frost Warrior on paper and marked the relevant data and handed it to him. black gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold took a look at it, his face suddenly became very colorful, and said to Richard: "This is also the tribe indigenous you conquered in the secondary plane? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugs: "I am lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold snorted, no longer Tangle this question, but ask: "So how much power do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei pointed to the humanoid target of the knight, saying: " It takes a shot to smash this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold suddenly took a breath! From this sentence, he vaguely glimpsed Richard's ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard used the entire night and black gold to confirm the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the first batch of Thor is set to a thousand, not black gold does not want to do more, but he really does not have so many people. Moreover, key parts need to improve the quality of materials, and some of them require additional purchases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the discussion, Richard found that at the beginning he ignored a crucial detail: ammunition supply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raytheon only takes one second to make a round of shè, which makes every Raytheon need astronomical ammunition supply to ensure their firepower. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the metal bobbin manufacturing process is simple, it can be produced by an alchemist, but the production capacity is always limited by tapping and knocking. Therefore, even if Richard had ordered 3,000 Thunder, he could not get so many ammunition. It would be better to lower the number of Raytheon so that the dark blue craftsmen have time to make more metal bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Raytheon, Black Gold also took over the work of designing equipment for the dark night. However, equipment manufacturing does not require the use of dark blue craftsmen. The weapons workshops jointly established by Richard and Nolan are now large enough to meet the needs of these magical equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard left Black Gold with a magic crystal worth one million gold coins. The money will be used exclusively to recruit more craftsmen, alchemists and mages apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Thor’s money, Richard will pay for the sacrifice. Sacrifices are more effective currencies than gold coins and magic crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raytheon is indeed a huge surprise, but it is not a panacea. Limited by the power of the dwarf gunpowder, how to improve it, its threat to the strong people above the sanctuary is also very limited, but it has no effect on the legendary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suppress the legendary powerhouse, it is still necessary to build a knight's throwing spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the equipment of the dark night jīng spirit, then the next step is to increase investment in the Greenson plane, greatly enhance the plane channel, and maintain the plane The high flow rate of time. This still requires sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now finds more and more that war seems to be inseparable from the dragon of eternal and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Deep Blue, Richard first contacted the Meks of the Millennium Empire. Although she had won a lottery with Mex, she is now familiar with the temperamental swordsman in the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, when Mex appears in the communication magic array, the face will not look good: "Is there anything? My time is precious! And the communication is very expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "I am paying for the communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex snorted and said, "That wants me now. Cut off the communication and save the money for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is no longer joking, saying: "I want to pass your family channel to the Eternal Dragon. Temple sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex, also serious, asked: "What kind of scale?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least one top sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big deal. Micks hesitated, but put aside his personal dislike of Richard and said: "There should be no problem, although I hate you very much. You should wait a moment, this thing is beyond the scope I can decide. I need to report to my father. As for the cost of using the sacrifice channel, I have to decide the father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "I will wait." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex has left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain amount of compensation to be paid through the channel of the Prince of Tumen. This is the same as the direct sacrifice of only the floating island giants in the Holy Alliance. This reward is often a sacrifice, and sometimes it is a resource or something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three human empire each have an eternal dragon temple, but Richard is now impossible to return to the Holy Alliance, and can not go to the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that he had just killed a Marquis of the Holy Tree Dynasty, the dynasty cabinet is discussing whether to fight him. If Richard appeared in the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Tree Dynasty, I am afraid it would not be so easy to return. Finally, he also has only one choice for the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Mex rushed back, his face a little weird, saying: "The father agreed with your request. As the price of using the sacrifice channel, To make a piece of clothing for me, I need a fourth order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and said, "A very reasonable request. Is it a custom design?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Prince Tumen has a high expectation for you! Then please be prepared, I will go to dì dū three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex bit his lower lip and nodded reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, Richard walked out of the portal on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex and the family’s elders are already waiting for him here. One of the big magisters looked at the time and moved: "The error is no more than a minute! Your lieutenant is very amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The ultra-remote magic transfer in the plane also tends to be biased in time. The farther away the distance, the more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s almost stepping on the point indicates that his accomplishments in space power have reached a peak. These big magisters deal with space every day and space, and light can read many things from a little bit of error in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "There is nothing special. Let's go, don't let the Prince wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting with the Prince of Tumen has the meaning of routine business. After a simple greeting, the Prince sent someone to escort Richard to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal dragon hall of the Millennium Empire is more grand than the Holy Alliance, and the architectural details are more beautiful. At the same time, the great priest who received Richard’s appearance was also extraordinarily arrogant, and the faintness in the speech expressed various disdain for the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know whether it’s intentional or unintentional. The people sent by the Prince of Tumen are onlookers, and there is no meaning of reconciliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not have the idea of ​​arguing with the big priest, but he was not prepared to give her any concession in this respect, so he sighed and said slowly : "Really, since the Vatican's great priests and quicksands have left, there are only a few guys in the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Alliance who have no use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big priest changed his face on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin and quicksand are the only gods of the entire Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the level of sand-sanding is lower, she still has incredible abilities as a god. For example, the sacrifice of the book of Time in the Faro plane is a miracle that no great priest can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning chanting is not to mention, looking at the entire Nolander cleric, she is probably one of the best. Moreover, before the holding of the eternal dragon temple, the van Gogh Lin of the morning was arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generations of oracles are from the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Alliance. After Vatican went to the field of darkness, and after drifting sand to the darkness, after a period of time, the entire Noland had no gods. So Richard said, "The guy who has no big use," and waited for the big priest to sneak in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great priest is forty years old, with sharp eyebrows and thin lips, slender eyes are full of anger at this time, improve The voice angered: "Are you insulting the eternal and the dragon of time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked calm and said: "I am only evaluating the eternal dragon. The priest of the temple is only. And this evaluation is very objective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest is obviously irritated by Richard’s attitude: "You are this! Everyone of the Eternal Dragon Temple A priest is a great eternal and the embodiment of the dragon of time in the mortal, is the embodiment of its great will! How dare you evaluate us like this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make yourself so important!" Richard sneered and interrupted the words of the great priest, then said: "The sacrifice is a matter between the sacrificer and the dragon of eternal and time. You gods even make a start. Don't count. Know your identity, don't make decisions for the eternal and time dragon, you are not qualified!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" The great priest pointed at Richard, and his face was flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Richard knocked out the hand that almost poked his nose, and said coldly: "If you don't want to host a sacrifice, Then change someone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
