			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As with my conclusion, these eggs are not naturally formed, Their natural forms of life should be human babies, injected with the blood of the dragon, and then secretly evoked, and become what they are now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tiramisu grabbed the head and asked doubts: "What good is this? The half-dragon people are mostly unable to give birth, just a one-time cannon fodder."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps limited by the rule of the crystal wall balance, whether in Noland or other known planes, artificial life and modified life have the same defects, the vast majority will lose fertility, even if When the Xiong Peter family, who was older than biological research, failed to break through this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "Of course it is good, because a large number of elite troops can be manufactured at one time, and the fighting power of the half-dragon can reach ten, a dragon loses. A month's blood can create hundreds of half-dragons. Although there are many half-dragon eggs in this incubator, the blood of two dragons is enough."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu scratched his head and asked: "But the demand for human babies will be very high, and the success rate of catalyzing Jackie Chan eggs will not be high."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the dragon plane, human beings are similar to livestock, and the animals that are raised are not used to slaughter and eat." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre lord nodded heavily and understood the roots of Richard’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and walked to the incubation hall. At the moment, there were hundreds of worker bees in the hall, and they kept collecting mucus secreted from the hall. And take care of those half-dragon eggs that have not been hatched. These were originally the work of the dragons, but the worker bees who received the detailed instructions after debugging were more skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinkers are also in the hall, and now it is entirely responsible for coordinating the work of taking care of the half-hearted eggs, and the thinkers are getting more and more help to Richard. In fact, its importance has surpassed the combat-type followers of Twilight and Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the role played by Xingyi is also steadily increasing. The greater the scale of the war, the more important the importance of the star, the small and medium-sized flying dragonfly Well, large-scale flying rafts, regardless of the volume or speed, can not be compared with the stars, even a star can support a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard glanced at the hall and asked, "How is the progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinker replied: "The sample of the culture fluid has been sent to the nest, only great The creator's nest can fully analyze its composition and function, and improve it. The growth of these half-legged eggs has been temporarily delayed, waiting for the results to be resolved. I believe that after a week, the analysis can be completed. The half-dragon warriors are placed under the control of the creators, and they will, like me, be completely subordinate to the will of the creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded Then left the incubation hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Semi-Dragon's Incubation Hall actually represents a road to build a warrior, and the nest is at the end of the road, or near the end. Therefore, Richard, who owns the mother's nest, did not need this technology at all. But now that the mother's nest has a complete soul, the situation has changed. Richard must increase all technical reserves and can no longer rely on the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the incubation hall, Richard took off and pulled up to the height of the kilometer, overlooking the entire Dragon Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this height, you can see the extreme far. At the end of the distant mountains, Gangde is leading the 30,000-strong Principality to attack the beading country. This time In the German army, there are only 2,000 ancestral combat units, including the humanoid knights. They are used for the emergency response of Gangde, and no longer serve as the main force as in the past wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since meeting with the parent nest and reconstructing the relationship with each other, Richard began to consciously let his followers gradually get rid of the battle against the nest. Unit dependence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of war is very smooth, Gangde led 30,000 public **, facing the army of more than 100,000 bead chains, but it is a continuous battle, a short number In the day, the opponent's two full-fledged main corps were eliminated. This unconstrained bald man is now gradually demonstrating his ability to command the commander. His talent in this area is obviously much stronger than the force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To completely defeat the Principality of the Beads, it is only a matter of time before the whole world is occupied. If Richardson puts all the tens of thousands of humanoid knights into the battlefield, he will immediately defeat the bead chain. The resistance of the Principality, but now for Richard, there is no difference between the early days and the late days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the plane war, the secular war is not for conquest, but for resources, and the other is to build a development model that suits the local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard thought about it, and took a crystal ball from his arms and played it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crystal ball, the doomsday mark made up of extremely complicated machinery is changing at a rapid speed, constantly morphing into various forms, many of which are seen at a glance It has a strong aggression and is obviously a kind of giant war weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard is only remembering the appearance of these weapons, it is impossible to analyze its internal structure and operating principle, but it can be seen that Noland Those war mechanics, including the amazing giant siege guns and magical warships built by the Dragon Blood Gnomes, are far less than the war mechanics that evolved from the Doomsday Seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even has some reluctance to imagine how powerful these war mechanics are. Whenever the end of the imprint is analyzed, Richard’s heart will always be a touch of faintness. The shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Nolan’s strong, the so-called war mechanics are just big toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege and the magical warships can not withstand the indiscriminate bombing of the strong, even the most powerful magic warships made by the dragon blood gnomes Can not stand Su Hailun's blow, a space burst can easily smooth out the entire fleet of dragon blood gnomes, and Richard's nuclear burst burst can completely evaporate the largest flagship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the war mechanics in the Doomsday mark really appeared in front of him, Richard suddenly felt that he was not so confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Richard suddenly remembered the horrible doomsday scene seen in the nest of Hughland, the deadly battlefield, which has been silently stated. The war on that day was fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, then took the doomsday mark to his eyes, watching the instantaneous changes in the internal machinery, silently calculating the analysis, now as long as there is some spare time, Li The investigation will analyze the end of the mark, in the process, Richard's wisdom talent will be greatly exercised, and thus rapid progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis was less than an hour later, and Li’s eyes suddenly turned black. The whole person shook and almost fell from the air. He fixed his mind and knew the spirit. The power is almost exhausted, and it is no longer possible to support the analysis of super strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the doomsday seal back into his arms, fell back to the Dragon Valley, and greeted all followers in his consciousness, and returned to his room. Deep meditation to restore magic and mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhaustion of spiritual power means that Richard is unable to use the power of the rules, which reduces the actual combat power of Richard to the level of the ordinary 20-level Magister, and many special abilities such as the king of metal and the fate ruling. It is affected or even impossible to use. Therefore, the use of the analysis of the doomsday imprint to temper the mental and intellectual talents is effective, but the risk is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the room, Richard summoned a group of elite knights to come to guard in consciousness, and then entered deep meditation, this meditation process But it is a bit strange, and soon after Richard entered the state of meditation, consciousness suddenly entered a strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world of nothingness, and Richard feels that his consciousness has completely lost contact with the body, surrounded by darkness and no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual tentacles of Richard explored in all directions, but there was no result, as if this is a completely empty space, but Richard faintly felt that it was not like this. Behind the darkness, there seems to be a lot of hidden world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what kind of effort Richard made, he couldn’t break the stagnation of darkness. It seemed to be trapped in this strange world for a while, time one by one. In the past, in the absolute dark silence, it seems that the flow of time is infinitely slow, and the speed of Richard's thinking is gradually slowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotions of Richard have not been affected. Without fear, uneasiness or irritability, he repeatedly released his spiritual tentacles. It seems that he can explore the end of time. I don't know how long it took, but Richard's true talent has mutated, and he has maintained a stable frequency of fluctuations. Therefore, in this nihilistic world, Richard has obtained a stable anchor point and coordinates. Knowing the flow rate of time will not lose the feeling of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of real talent, Richard immediately found that the slower time flow is only his own illusion, because the speed of thoughts is also slowing down, this process could have been Infinitely magnified, even if only one second passed in reality, it will be like a millennium in this dark and dull world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, almost no one can support it for such a long time in this environment. If you want to understand this, Richard will be afraid after a while, if he has been shaken before. If you do, it may actually fall into the eternal darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
