			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stayed in the magic test room for ten days. Fortunately, the process of refining the magic potion went smoothly. In the end, Richard got 30 potions, each of which had the effect of extending life for three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of refining the potions, Richard used a lot of the power of life rules to constantly extract the life in the plane and put them and the tree of life. The heart mixes and blends into the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process gave Richard a glimpse of his faintness. He faintly felt that the underlying rules of the sixteen rules of life had begun to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion refining was successful, and it was not far from the parent nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao xìng sinks his heart and decides to stay for a few more days to see the results of the parent nest. Of course, these days can not be vain, so he specially opened up a laboratory and arranged a large number of soul protection. After all the heavy protections were set up, the ruling was taken seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade of the ruling has a ray of light from time to time, and there is a will of the world tree in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rì Richard used the ruling to devour the soul, swallowed the will of the tree of life and the tree of the world, and then the soul of the tree of life was the blade of the tree Digested, it became part of the power of the blade itself. However, the will of the world tree is extremely tenacious, and the ruling is difficult to engulf and digest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after discovering this, Richard immediately stopped the process of ruling the will of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world tree is extremely precious, and it is almost the only shortcut to analyze the underlying rules of the Greenson plane. After Richard was originally prepared to take down the world tree, he began to try to resolve the underlying rules. However, he did not expect the world tree to send a sense of consciousness to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling was placed in the magical zhōng yāng, and then under the will of Richard, the will of the world tree imprisoned in the ruling was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of fist-sized green sès fluttered from the ruling blade, and immediately made a squeaking sound, flying like lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the magical array suddenly appeared in the way of the grating, a magical prisoner rises flat, trapping this group of light. The world tree consciousness is left and right, but every time it is bounced back by the grating, it can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard went to the side of the circle and said, "Don’t bother, if you let me escape, I don’t have to be a sect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of the world tree is fear and anger, and constantly threatens Richard through consciousness, but Richard is unmoved, but will A frame of alchemy machinery is erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four compact machines are placed in the four corners of the circle, each of which shue a light and meets in a void. And this superimposed light spot, if there is a will, firmly reflects the consciousness of the world tree, no matter how the green sè light flies away, can not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few instigations, the green light group could not move, and screamed in vain. After a while, its light suddenly dimmed and no longer struggled, as if it could die at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it, just smiled. Even the ruling can't digest the will of the world tree. What is the energy generated by this experiment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of the will of the world tree is, after all, only the green level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard has finished all preparations, close to the will of the world tree, and his eyes are beginning to shine, and more and more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the ray of light, the original world tree consciousness suddenly found that its protection is disintegrating, and the hidden secrets at the core began to appear one by one. This time it was really struggling, screaming, but unable to stop the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tenth day, Richard came out of the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling became dimmed, and in the squad, the consciousness of the world tree has completely disappeared. Richard felt that there was some regret. To resolve the underlying rules, only the consciousness of the world tree was completely decomposed. In the process, the traces of the underlying rules could be peeked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson Plane has a total of 16 underlying life rules, and now Richard has resolved the first one. With the beginning, the latter becomes very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, this is extremely significant, and this is the first time he rules the underlying rules of the plane. Although Greenson is only a secondary plane with a low power limit, the meaning of the underlying rules is more important than the Norland senior rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any high-level rules are derived from the underlying rules, and the underlying rules are the cornerstone of truly building the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the cost of parsing the underlying rules is the world tree consciousness. In the eyes of Richard, this ambiguity is actually part of the soul of the world tree. Because the world tree soul is born to be powerful, this consciousness itself is enough to form a powerful magical soul and become the core of the fifth-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the world tree will have dissipated, although Richard can create a new magical soul based on the analytical knowledge, but far less powerful than the world tree consciousness. The fifth-order structure made by it is only the entry level of the holy structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard’s greatest gain is that his real name has once again evolved. After Raven, who represents life, a new kind of divine text emerges. The two real names are combined, that is, Rivendell, meaning the land of the living and the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the opposite side of Richard’s real name to Desmasson, his real name is changed to Saron Rivendell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new real name also gave Richard the power to influence the soul. Now Richard has a new ability and the soul is solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul of the dying is cast to the soul, the soul of the deceased can be maintained for a period of time under the power of the real name, which is equivalent to being temporarily dead. The same is true even if the body is traumatized again. When the soul's solid effect passes, the wounded will really die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the soul is stable against many attacks of dead magic, such as death, even the ninth-level banshee and the death of the law . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real name awakening and the acquisition of the soul's ability to stabilize are all unexpected gains, and with the control of the underlying rules, Richard's control over the power of life has increased dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the 'redemption' of the Azure Moon is almost doubled now, and the effect is no worse than the 'healing' that the 18th-level priest is fully committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing all the harvests, Richard is almost ready to leave Greenson. Richard sent a message to the mother's nest to ask about the situation of the promotion. The ancestral avatar immediately used the vast amount of information to drown the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has been successfully promoted to the ninth order, and began to use the power of the Golden World Tree to create twenty fifteenth-level dark night jīng spirit, and two sixteen The level of jīng British dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to test the combat power, the mother's nest has used thousands of low-level beasts to besiege the dark night jīng spirit, the result is very exciting. These dark nights are under the siege of the massive five-level beasts. They have been insisting that they have all died in the middle of the day, and they have killed more than a thousand beasts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Norland standard, the five-level combat power is already the standard for ordinary soldiers. These dark nights can be said to have eliminated a considerable army. This result made Richard very satisfied. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, after eating two whole trees of life, the mother’s nest has improved its understanding of life and natural rules, and now it has been able to create Drew. According to the unique arms of this jīngling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Druid created by the Brood avatar can use most of the natural and life-like spells, but not as deformable as the real Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Richard's opinion, Druid's ability to deform is completely a chicken. If Richard lacks World of Warcraft, it is better to let the mother's nest directly create a new breed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the new dark night jīng spirit gives up some hidden and hidden ability, in exchange for powerful power and defense. There is no shortage of scouts in Richard. There are hundreds of strange and weird, various kinds of reconnaissance flying beasts in the mother's nest. The role of the night jīng spirit is to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s appearance made Richard feel extremely surprised. He immediately told the mother's nest to do all the power to create Druid, as for the dark night jīng spirit warrior is not in a hurry. Druid needs more resources than the warrior, and the mother's nest can make eight fifteen-level Druids per day, or two sixteen-level jade. The number of night warriors is ten and three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee asked the mother's nest to be created according to the rhythm of eight ordinary Druids a day, two jīng in the day. Let him make it for a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
