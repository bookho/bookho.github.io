			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and then modified the plan, his own The total investment remains unchanged. Nyres and Agamemnon can own one-third of the entire Greenson plane, and the compensation for the under-investment is compensated by the channels they own. Agamemnon and Nyris will ensure that they supply at least 10 million weapons and equipment to Richard every year. Reliable and stable supply channels for combat readiness, which is urgently needed by Richard, who lacks contacts now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is balanced so far, and all three parties are satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day's sacrifice ceremony was also very smooth, and Nyris's two sacrifices were all successfully obtained the required grace. It is not easy to force the Greenson plane time flow to become eight times that of Noland, that is, in the green eight days, Noland will only one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sacrifice of the gods is used for the reinforcement of the Greenson plane channel, reducing the transmission cost per person from three thousand to two thousand. The assembly of Nyris and Agamemnon was faster than scheduled, so the day after the sacrifice was completed, they could enter the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fastest time, because Richard has to build a plane portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plane portals were erected in the underground magic zone of the floating island castle, and the fixed portals were adjusted to one-way return before Gotton’s departure. Only the magic message can be transmitted. If the person or material is going to pass, it must be communicated with the portal and re-arranged. Otherwise, only a space plane magician can establish a new plane channel with the plane coordinates, or the big magician directly opens the plane plane. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After checking the transmission array of the basement, he decided to rebuild a channel. First, the cost of the two is similar. Secondly, he found that the transmission array of the Greenson plane was added to the space magic lock in addition to the one-way state. It may be because this plane was taken from the Xiong Peter family, so The fixed plane channel is handled with special care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has no data on the portal, and time does not allow him to parse the original transmission array. Instead, he finds that the channel capacity is not enough or has equipment. It is better to re-arrange one of the troubles such as restrictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard built the plane portal to Greenson in the Eternal Dragon Hall, which is only one wall away from the portal to Faro. However, although there is only one wall, this wall is the wall of the Eternal Dragon Hall, so there is no need to worry about safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greenson plane is different from Faro. It is a semi-mature plane. The plane transmission cost is very low, so you can bring more people into it. Richard returned to the floating island and began to think about who could take him to Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the blood was taken, and almost all of the followers of Faro were drawn back, and they brought back five knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another milestone attempt is a twilight. Richard actually succeeded in bringing her from Faro to Noland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original he did not intend to take the risk, but the twilight knows that he wants to bring almost all followers away, several times trying to sneak into the portal, instead of messing with her Oh, let's try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of usefulness and uselessness, Richard added a bunch of tracking magic to the twilight and deliberately kept in touch with her while walking into the portal. Although he experienced a false alarm when the twilight was later than his advanced door, it was a success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this successful attempt cannot be overstated, which means that in the future, Richard will be able to bring the ancestral army out of Faro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the twilight stepped out of the portal, Richard immediately realized the significance of strengthening the Faro plane. This is almost the overriding goal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally decided to take another 20 level 10 step knights and free Archimonde fighters from the floating island and take them to the Greenson plane. He is now limited to the high cost of the Faro plane, so there are thousands of humanoid fighters, but they can't bring Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard prepared the list, it was already late at night. He stretched his tired body and took out the three-magic armored drawings from the battlefield of the extremity and began to study it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Arms is a very unique and extremely effective construct. Its role is to stimulate the magic, and transform the wizard's magic into a similar vindictive energy, thus greatly improving the power, speed and defense of the Master. From the effect point of view, this structure is similar to the war in the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already unusual, because the magical warfare is not something that any priest can cast. The sacred officers who can release the war are all outstanding figures who can become great priests in the future. In addition, in terms of ability enhancement, whether in Nolan or Faro, it is recognized that magic is not as good as magic. However, the magical armed forces are only the third-order structure, but the effect can be compared with the war. It must be said that the design is exquisite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to magic, balance has never been a good choice. The magician has never been enough to use the magic power, who will be fine to turn the magic into vindictive use? And in the eyes of high-level wizards, the comrades of the same level are not terrible. The higher the order, the less the violent warriors will resist the magic of the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of Dark Blue inheritance is an alternative, and they are all strong. It's just that it's purely physically strong, in order to better carry the magic, not to beat people with a fist. For example, Richard had to learn a part of the dark world warfare skills, which is considered to be a bad business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard thought of the absolute battlefield and thought of the purest and worst environment, it suddenly became clear! When the two mages meet, they have the magician armed with the mage, and they can defeat the opponent. This construct is essentially the same as the idea of ​​life, in order to kill opponents in the shortest possible time. The magical armed forces are not so purely boosting the killing power, but the corresponding life-saving ability is provided as compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the structure of the magical armed forces, Richard was amazed at the subtlety of its conception! Then his entire body and mind sank into the world of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of construction, the passage of time is accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the clock of the magic clock has been pointing to three o'clock at midnight, and it will be brighter after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not realize that he had not rested one day and one night, still sketching on paper, calculating the magical array principle of this structure. This is a sketch, although it is quite complete, but it takes a lot of work to achieve a real build. On his hand, on the table and on the floor, countless papers have been thrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, there was a piece of clothing on Richard’s shoulder. After a while, Richard had a cup of warm water on his desk. Richard didn't want to think about it. When he picked it up, he drank it, then put the empty cup aside and continued his calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty cup is filled with warm water. Richard took it and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he had a plate of cut fruit and two slices of bread on his hand. When the sights swept them, Richard instinctively felt hungry, so he took it and cleaned the dishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty disc disappeared by itself, leaving a clean and orderly space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the scratch papers scattered on the ground began to gather together. Most of them are process calculations, and there is no value. But there are also a few important inspirations recorded in the work that Richard needs to keep. This part of the manuscript was originally placed on the table, piled up in the grass, but was inadvertently touched by the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, several working papers were separated from the waste paper and they returned to where they were. The waste paper is stacked in a neat stack and placed next to the waste paper basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Richard added another cup of warm water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Richard suddenly had a happy face, and he slammed the table, and the pen quickly ran out a long list of numbers and formulas. In one breath, he leaned back into the back of his chair and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes of rest, the dizziness of a little disengagement finally passed. When I opened my eyes again, I suddenly snorted and looked at the cup of water that suddenly appeared on my desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Ming Ming remembers that he had already drunk the water in the cup, but now the cup is full. But think again, even this cup should not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this cup, but even the fruits and breads that have appeared before should not appear. The working papers should be thrown over the table, rather than being stacked neatly at the moment. The coat that you wear on your body should stay in the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Li turned around and saw the Qi Qi who stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Qi Qi is quiet, there is another kind of beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the working paper and flipped it over and asked, "Is this all you organized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and took the design of the magical armor and took out a blank sheet of paper. Write a set of formulas on the brush and hand it to Qi Qi, saying, "Calculate it, you have ten minutes." Then he stood up, walked two steps, stretched and sat for a whole night with a stiff body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi sat in the position of Richard and began to bury his head. Richard walked back and forth in the room, thinking about several problems that have been plaguing him for some time. With the magical armed forces as a reference, several problems have been solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it done." Qi Qi stood up and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was surprised. When she saw the magic clock, she actually only spent three minutes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard took a glance at the paper, he knew that Qi Qi did solve all the formulas. It is really commendable to complete in such a short period of time. However, this set of formulas involves the geometry of the plane. The way of Qi Qi's analysis is rather clumsy. It is the idea of ​​Nolande's orthodox magician, which is several levels worse than the inheritance of dark blue. However, for an eight-level magician, it is already unexpected to be able to figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
