			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the royal family allowed many angry little nobles to recognize the reality and they finally It was found that the royal tree was not as strong and huge as it was supposed to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other hand, the Duke of Glasgow unexpectedly remained silent and not as firm as ever. Standing on the side of the royal family, this caused a lot of speculation by the nobility. However, the Duke did not make any clarifications and refused all visitors on the grounds of repairing old injuries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly another Then the rumors began to spread among the nobility, that is, the number of the priests of Him, who suddenly fell into a deep sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who knows the inside is immediately shocked or ashamed because it means Him The Viscount finally began to awaken the blood of the unicorn's blood. Once he awakened, he would enter the sanctuary directly and would not be comparable to the common Faro sanctuary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other The matching message is that the Countess Ekaterina has been pregnant<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in the next decade or so, the political situation of the kingdom will change because of the blood of a unicorn, but the situation in front of the kingdom is facing great turmoil because Richard is leading his knight in the kingdom. If you walk around and walk wherever he goes, the situation will change greatly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop of Richard is the Duke of the Wolf.<br /> Br /> /> </ br> </ br> ;&nbsp;The castle of the Duke of the Wolf is still as thick and heavy as before, but its current soul has been taken out of the way and has become a giant in the outer strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Duke took the lead, he sent several knights to inform all the important figures in the Duke’s collar. As for the people who were not in the Duke’s collar, Richard simply thought that they did not intervene in the affairs of the Duke’s collar.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this repressed afternoon, the Duke of the Wolf is like a frightened food. The grass beast slowly moved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not stop at the border but walked along the road to the castle at a speed of no more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the road were busy grabbing before the advent of the deep winter The people who made the last wave of crops are standing in the same place and watching the team obviously different from other people. The knights who belong to the territory of the whole life are all working, eating and sleeping. The invasion war was too far away from them, so no one recognized that the flag of Richard was even more unlikely to recognize who the most brilliant big man was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several names in the distance The knight flew to the front of Richard and hurriedly slowed down as the first young man to jump off the horse and look up at Richard and exclaimed excitedly: "You are the adult of Richard"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Toffler"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I am an adult," young people are excited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard Chaga sits on a unicorn looking down at the young man in front of the horse<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Duke of the Wolf Still very young, it seems that the 30-year-old Faro plane is a human aristocrat who generally believes that the man is fully mature and can bear the responsibility of the leader. The sweat on the forehead and the messy hair show that he is coming all the way but the direction of the young man is obvious. It's not the avenue of the castle but a small road from the side. Just look at the scale of the road and know that the other end is just a small town or even a village.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems In the more than a month after the death of the Duke of the Wolf, the young man named Toffler was unsatisfactory as the heir appointed by the Duke of the Duke of the Wolf. He was even driven out of the castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to come from the castle" Richard faintly asks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people are red and somewhat embarrassed and somewhat Angrily replied: "They...they don't recognize the father's dying will say that it is you...forged, so they have to re-elect the duke's heirs and even want to divide the father's territory. My mother is only a viscount family so she can give it to me. Very helpful Moreover, my grandfather’s territory has recently been attacked. They have many people. I have no way to leave the castle and be placed in a jazz territory for the safety of my mother and grandfather’s family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said with a smile: "The jazz collar seems to be very generous. I originally thought that I would only give you a manor and tell me who they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people apparently have a deep hatred for these people, so the memory is extremely profound: "The Earl of Sokya, the Earl of the Marquis of Mikaboro, the Count of Sokoya..." This is a long list and half of the names Richard did not have much impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names that haven’t been impressed under Richard’s intellectual talent can only show that they are insignificant or even have not entered his previous intelligence system<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Toffler walked and talked all the way to the castle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a conversation, Richard felt that the young man was quite smart and The nature is cautious and has the necessary kindness. Such a person inherits the position of the Duke and is at least qualified to hold the foundation left by the Duke of the Wolf. As for this generation, don’t think that a strong child like the Duke of the Wolf often becomes Compared with the lack of self-confidence and the sudden death of the Duke of the Wolf, except for the territory, there are a lot of enemies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler suddenly burst into amazement: "To be Castle"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned to look at him and said, "How is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They..." Toffler finally got the courage to say "They don't allow me to enter." Castle"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s okay, you are coming in with me," Richard said faintly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They said that they wouldn't go with anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Then kill the opponents"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler took a sip of cold and then felt the back of the cold and couldn’t help but look back. Only then did the detectives of the various knights behind him look almost everywhere. There is a real murderous murder<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the city gate, the city defense army has already seen the banner of Richard, but they even saw that Toffler was strictly forbidden. Entering the heirs of the castle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing in Toffler who will let you come here and return to your territory" An obese officer in the city heads up Hong Liang Don't use French forces put out the sound of hundreds of meters <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"And you guys, who are you immediately dismissed and checked here is the castle of the Duke of the Wolf can not enter and exit now." The officer saw that the call of Richard was louder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li The knights who are still walking behind the gates at a constant speed are also traveling at the same speed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurer’s policy to understand the rules of the aristocratic game Before the horse, he angered and said: "Your eyes are all stunned. This is Richard. The nicks of Archimonde are responsible for supervising the execution of the Duke's widow and opening the gate. If the time is wrong, the responsibility is that you are not as good as the shit. If you dare to swear, I will kill you directly. You are also white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese officer’s face is ugly. He received an order not to allow Tofler to enter the city. There are also different cities under the Richard Richard. Archimonde, although Richard’s battle with the Knights of the Twenty Knights has not been transmitted here, but the name of the King of Richards has been loud enough. The obese officer’s courage and background are too big to dare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his face with oil and sweat and tried to squeeze out a smile and said: "I don't have the right to let you go through the invitation, please wait for me to ask the Earl of Sokya to come over"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s lazy voice sounded: "I don't know what Count Soskey is, but from now on the city is hosted by me if I go Go to the city gate and don't open it and attack the city"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siege<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest one The word is almost to let the fat officer faint at once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s unicorn is less than ten meters away from the city gate. It was full of bow arrows pointing to the direction of Richard, but Richard was unaware that he did not see the sharp arrows not far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese officer suddenly jumped I screamed and screamed: "The bastard puts the bow down and lets you open the bow. I am going to open the door to open the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene Let Richard It’s quite unexpected that Oral’s hand has been placed on the longbow behind him. It’s also awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf poet is sure to shoot at the first time. Dead fat officer, if he dares to order the attack, but this is mostly due to the fact that there are two Nolander level magisters on the head of the team but there is not enough magic defense power. A large range of magic in the past, the city warrior will be cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
