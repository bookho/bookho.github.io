The result of the search is naturally nothing. Nyris and Agamemnon tried to find Druid more than once when the forest was walking in the night, but there was no result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris brought the sanctuary strong, Sheer, who once went alone into the forest, but almost never came back. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that a hundred kilometers away from the city, there is a mysterious force in the forest, which will greatly weaken the ability to perceive and suppress the will, seriously affecting the sense of direction. . If he was not experienced in the wild, he would immediately return if he did not notice it in time. I am afraid that he will always be lost in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher's exploration results, so that everyone is vigilant, 100 kilometers will become a temporary restricted area line. However, there are too many blank areas within a hundred kilometers to explore. As long as you leave the city for ten kilometers, the variety of trees will increase greatly, and there are many kinds of trees that can sell at a good price in Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every few days, Richard will organize a heavy-duty slashing team to enter the depths of the forest and harvest these famous trees. Agamemnon sent a message to the family territory and began to recruit a large number of artisans who made high-quality bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris wants to fight, that is, sweeping in the 100-kilometer area. He knows that it is almost impossible to have any results, just want to move on to the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also very aware of his mind and said: "Wait again, there should be progress soon."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sent Nris, and Richard came to the residence of Dragon Master. Lina lives on the top floor of the Magic Tower, where the space is actually quite small, but the advantage is that it can be condescending and overlooking the forest in the distance. As a ranged attack unit, the magician and the shooter are somewhat similar, and the field of vision is very important. In this way, Lina monitors the movements of the elves. When Richard entered the room, Lina lazily squatted on the sofa and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Always wait, is it?" Long Master asked Yu Yu. More than a dozen old men’s scenes swallowed by trees are still occasionally flashing in front of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be results soon. The patience of the elves is getting smaller every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lina’s eyes lit up and asked, “Is it? How do you see it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: “It’s a walking forest. Driving the forest Druids should have been seven to eight, but as the area of ​​our logging has grown larger, the number of Druids has increased to ten in the past week. But the two new Drews are significantly more powerful than others. Druid is a lot worse. In addition, the number of Druids driving trees has increased a lot. You understand what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They I have tried my best." Lina's face flashed a brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. This shows that the progress of our logging has touched the bottom line they tolerate. They should act soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time Neris killed a lot of elves, did they dare to appear this time? If they really came, they must have found other ways!" Lina reminded . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded. "I think so. Unfortunately, we know too little about the elves, so I can't think of the way they will attack us. But it doesn't matter, as long as they attack once, we don't know. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said slowly: " Give them the opportunity to let the elves attack our warriors. As long as the important personnel don't lose, then we will win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina frowns, she really wants Ask the soldiers what to do, but don't really ask for it. She knows that she is a talented mage, but she is just an ordinary general, not a qualified commander. All she can do is to control herself and not let herself influence Richard’s judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will start to draw and mix troops in the afternoon." Richard said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina nodded and her face was not very good looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently, finally took the shot of Lina’s shoulder and left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina fell on the sofa and looked at the window slyly, and tears ran down her cheeks unconsciously. In fact, similar things have been repeated for so many years, but she still has no habits and still can't control the warriors who may be attacked. But this is a plane war. If you want to win in a war, you have to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, she is still very young, less than thirty this year. When she started to go around with Gordon, she was only a 16-year-old. Teenage girl. Both the original Gordon and the current Richard will pat her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way to treat comrades and brothers, not a woman. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, Richard reorganized the troops and organized them into six logging units, and the deforestation. But this time the leader is an elite humanoid knight. And all important people, including Agamemnon and Nyris, are forbidden to leave the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a team of logging forces left the city, the officers on the city head felt a bit strange, mainly in the plane environment, the elite human knight was a scarlet The armor is really eye-catching. This is simply to provide a live target for the elves. However, the elf has not appeared for a long time. This group of humanoid knights is indeed powerful. They are usually silent and do not communicate with anyone. Therefore, no one reminded them to change the painting of the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the logging team went out of town, Richard went down to the city and returned to his lab. Qi Qi stayed alone in the lab and was looking at a book about magical arrays. She was already in the gods, and she did not know that Richard had returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the forest map." Li asked, and squeezed a Qiqi's ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi Yiyan opened the magic sandbox and re-adjusted the magic map according to the data dictated by Richard. On the sand table, the magical image shows the changes in the forest area around the city. Where it was cut down, where it was repaired by Druid, it was very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard surrounded his arms and stood in front of the magic sandbox, silently calculating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard’s eyes stretched out and said to Qi Qi: “Help me prepare a set of clothes for the night action. Be prepared before dinner. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in the consciousness, Richard ordered the water and the twilight: "Be prepared, go out and kill me at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water and twilight instantly They seem to be boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in Nolan's dark blue, Black Gold is holding a magnifying glass and carefully studying the pile of rock-like fragments piled up in front of the tray. That is the rock wood unique to the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold has been studying for a while under curiosity, but has no clue. He is a great master in ore and jewelry, and rock is actually a kind of tree, which belongs to the field where he knows nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pondering for a while, his curiosity was finally exhausted, so he pulled the magic bell and said to a young wizard who came in: "Take that root Take the stone-like trunk and take it to the damn gnomes. Tell them that their goal is to find a way to ignite the wood simply and quickly. If it can be done in a week, they can get 20,000 gold coins. In addition, let's tell the damn arrogant elves. If their project doesn't progress, don't even want to get the 50,000 gold coins. I can wait for them for two weeks!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Master is a bit strange, but without asking, but taking the lead. He summoned a magical cockroach, picked up the heavy rock and tree trunk, and left the office and laboratory of Black Gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the young mage left, Black Gold’s line of sight fell on the report in his hand. The above list is a dense research project, followed by the progress bar of the project. It can be seen that the research progress of many projects suddenly increased significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf sighed and muttered, "How come I didn't think of this idea? Richard, the kid, is a natural gray dwarf!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, Richard himself has raised many topics in magic research, and is also interested in some of the experiments that are underway in Deep Blue. Richard had an urgent need for time, so many special bonuses were set up. If the research mage and alchemist can complete the study within the scheduled time, they will receive an additional bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is of course from Richard’s personal pockets and will not enter the deep blue treasury. However, Black Gold does not look like this. This means that the Richard project is accepted, or the mages who are funded by Richard, the personal income will increase accordingly, and the increase will not be small. In fact, this disguised makes the deep blue appeal to the mages, because everyone knows that Richard is a student of Su Helun. He is also commissioned through the deep blue system. Once he leaves the dark blue, he may not be able to get such good conditions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold suddenly opened a messaging magic array on the table. After the magic array was lighted, there was a deafening explosion from inside, followed by a sharp cough. After the image of the swaying motion stabilized, an image of the old Elf Magister appeared. The robe on his body was ragged, black and gray, and his beard burned a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old guy, failed again? Hahaha!" The gray dwarf immediately laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Magister is furious and shouts: "Gray Dwarf! If you just want to humiliate me, then it is best to try it on the magic field!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold smiled and said, "Do you think I will be afraid of you? But I have a new proposal now, a proposal that will allow me more pocket money. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
