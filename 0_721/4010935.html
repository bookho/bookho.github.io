After confirming that everything is correct, Richard stood up and smiled and said: "Everything is very good." Normal. The old butler should be ready, and I am there, you don't have to worry about anything. The little guy should be born three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa With him, he said with some uneasiness: "There are still three days! You are coming back so early, don't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's okay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco bite the lower lip and whisper: "Sorry, I can't help you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Nothing, you just have to rest well, you don't have to do anything." He looked at the time and said, "When it's time to drink the potion, why haven't you sent the medicine?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door opened and the old butler and a young female mage came in. The female magician is holding the life potion in her hand. Richard stared at her and said coldly: "You are five minutes late. Then the next time, you will go back to the original place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The female mage suddenly paled and couldn’t say anything. She quickly served cocoa and finished the medicine, then immediately retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the action of the life potion, the cocoa's face immediately added a layer of blood, and the body actually appeared a lot. But this is only temporary. It will take less than a day, and her extra vitality will be absorbed by the fetus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco said: "Lee, don't blame her. It's no big deal after five minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Licha face sè but did not look much, snorted, said: "I set the time when the potion can play the most effective effect, once more than ten minutes, the effect will be sharply reduced. Hey, a mage if Even if the magic clock doesn't look at it, what better is it for them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also said to the old housekeeper: "How do you manage them badly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler sighed and said: "These wizards are mostly from dark blue. Except for you and Ali Lie, whoever they usually do not listen to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard immediately sank and said: "This is the case." I thought I had managed to be honest enough to obey them. It seems that it is not enough. Now, I will give you one hundred knights, who are solely responsible for the internal affairs of the castle. What is not convenient for you to manage, Let them go and say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler agreed, and said: "Young master, there are a lot of things that you need to handle yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Coco and said, "Let's go to the study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in the study, Richard looked at the pile of letters piled up in front of him, his face was very ugly. He quickly dismantled it, and when he glanced at it, he threw the letter aside and read all the letters in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These letters are all the same content, that is, I heard that Richard will have the first descendant, so I am ready to send someone to congratulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a very common move among the nobility, but it was unusual time and scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter that was placed in front of Richard and ready to read again took up two-thirds of the congratulatory letter. Those who can be separated by Richard are the real lords of the Marquis or above, or the big figures with similar status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of results is completely beyond the imagination of Richard. Moreover, most of these families sent heavyweights, and even the family of the Duke’s family came in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the sacred alliance’s floating island giants have come to six, and there are no six-story floating island giants who have been confronted with Richard’s front. The Iron Man was sent to Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the special relationship with Richard, Agamemnon has been steadily stabilizing in recent years, step by step, constantly accumulating triumphant military strength, and personal strength has surpassed the 19th level. Approaching the celestial sanctuary of the 20th level. The fragrant root iris pattern with the sky blue sè wing shield is also officially appearing in the family family of the Duke of Iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon's progress doesn't look particularly fast, but the scary thing is that he is so chilling that there seems to be nothing to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may have ups and downs, have setbacks, or have pride and complacency, ready to relax, but Agamemnon has never relaxed himself. After several years, people who were similar to him suddenly realized that the gap between themselves and Agamemnon was too big to be compensated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Iron and Blood has officially confirmed that Agamemnon is the heir to the title, and another white night familiar to Richard has entered the legend earlier, now Hide in a no-known plane to consolidate your rule of law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jagged family is now the first giant of the Holy Alliance, and the difference is just the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When White Night is also behind Richard, it is considered to be the person who may be promoted to the super power in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a Grand Duke in the Holy Tree Dynasty who sent messengers. There is nothing in the Duke, but considering the subtle relationship between the Holy Tree Dynasty and Richard, and the identity of the Duke’s own deputy head of the Southern Army, this is somewhat intriguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no more jealousies in the Millennium Empire than in the other two empires. They can be said to have the best relationship with Richard. The so-called best, in fact, is normal, there is nothing to hate on the table. So the family that came from the Millennium Empire was the most, even more than the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen sent the messenger, and his status is actually equivalent to inquiring the news for the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these letters, Richard understands the true purpose of these people. They really look at Richard's children. The purpose of this trip is to confirm the strength of Akmon's blood, and how big the inheritance may be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the Archimonde family suddenly came out with two powerful characters, Gordon and Richard, who died young and died miraculously. Confined to the inside of the alliance, the vibrations brought to the mainland are not too big, but Richard now has a lot of halo. The emergence of the Battle of Midrande made him completely superior to the other two sects on the mainland and became the real first person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of identity, Richard can already be equal to the super strong. This is very important, at least to guarantee the legality of Archimonde from the divine alliance dú lì. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hidden rule in the upper class of Noland that has been used for many years, that is, only superpowers are qualified to establish a true dúlì country. As for the Principality, the Kingdom or the Empire, it depends on the size of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not super strong and want dú lì, it is likely to incur the interference of the old giants. The long-standing family has regarded the maintenance of tradition as its own innate responsibility, and the giants of the three major empire are the same. So when Archimonde announced the dú lì, it would attract so many interfering forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth of Richard is only one of the reasons. On the other hand, in the hearts of the nobility, this kind of interference is also legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now that Richard has the same status as the superpower, it has also lost the excuses for the intervention of the aristocratic private army. If you want to crusade Richard, you need to find new reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland is a plane of the only bloodline theory, a strong blood is the first element of becoming a strong, as other factors are often considered not so important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All veteran aristocrats are tirelessly looking for ways to motivate their blood and make it stronger. It is also a common practice to absorb other people with powerful blood into the family in the absence of progress in their own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a strong voice in the current Nolan’s upper class, thinking that Gordon and Richard’s performance is enough to make Akmon’s blood The top bloodline of the mainland. But to prove this, it is still necessary to see the children of Richard. Newborn babies are the easiest to see the bleeding force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is not exclusive to this, and the reason for his anger is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of these nobles is very accurate, basically will arrive in these two days, some get early, but only two days earlier than Richard. Only. The problem is that Richard did not disclose the period of cocoa production. Only some people around him and Cocoa will know about it. Then, where did the news leak from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not an insider leak, but the other party finds out, it is even more terrible. Doesn't it mean that the opponent's mage can go in and out of the Black Rose Castle, and that Richard is still ignorant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" Richard asked at the letter on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler also knows the meaning of these letters, and immediately said: "I have privately investigated the people in the castle. Initially, it may be the servants inside the castle. The news of the leak, now I have narrowed the scope, just wait for further observation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shrinking the scope? How small is the range?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a total of nine people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a wave and said coldly: "I There is no time for you to observe further. Grab these nine people, check them immediately, and thoroughly check them. I don't believe that I can't find any clues. I will let Kingsley help you. With her help, there is no Who can keep the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Yes, young master." The old butler seemed to be hesitant, but did not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are demonstrating, hehe!" Richard took the hesitation of the old butler and couldn’t bear to look at it, slowly suppressing his anger and slowing down his breath. Said: "Now our Akmon family has become very large, people of all shapes will have, and there will be more and more in the future. People like Kingsley will continue to join, you should probably get used to it. In addition, from now on, I will set a rule for everyone to let them see where my principles and bottom line are. I don't object to them seeking some of their own interests, as long as they contribute to Archimonde. But I will never allow betrayal! This kind of betrayal of family interests will never be tolerated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, young master." Old housekeeper Deeply sighed in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of Richard’s emphasis on this child, and he also understands the division and protection of the family’s core interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact date of the birth of the child is now spread, as everyone on the mainland knows that Archimonde has sold this important news, which is equivalent to blatant There was a slap in the face of Richard. Most of the people who come now are the people who congratulate, but what if the news is the enemy of Richard? I believe that many people on the mainland are looking forward to Richard's bloodshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
