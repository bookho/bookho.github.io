			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecutor began to read the final allegations, in the long interrogation, all the facts It’s clear that the young prosecutor stood in front of all the aristocrats and voiced his voice. He used his rigorous logic and strong evidence to support his point of view. Perhaps Marshal Lundstedt only had a finger outstretched. It is possible to kill him, but the prosecutor is not afraid. The entire number of complaints filed is up to three, totaling nearly 500 pages. Of course, it is impossible for him to recite these things, and he just can’t think of it. The House of Lords only gave it. In ten minutes, the distinguished members of the parliament are big men, and they can't spend time in this matter endlessly, although most nobles spend more time on afternoon tea than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, the young prosecutor gave a brilliant speech and saw how much effort he had made after ten minutes. At the end of the complaint, Marshal Lundstedt finally raised his eyelids and glanced at the prosecutor faintly. Only a few people, including Richard, saw the implied murder in the marshal's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because the prosecutor is threatening, but the marshal feels impatient, just as Richard is like Cannan, a big man, will not allow only The flies are whispering in the ear, although both Richard and Marshal know that these people are just being instructed, but this does not mean that they do not have to pay the price. When the dog is not without risk, sometimes the risk is even more Big, not every dog ​​is not afraid of death. As long as one kills one and is willing to be a dog, it will become less and less. This is Richard’s usual opinion, so he can ignore who is behind the scenes, but The Cannan and Silver Sword families will definitely be put to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young prosecutor has already finished his speech, because of the excitement, his face seems to float a layer of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sighed, and from the young prosecutor, he saw the naked ambitions, such people, often in order to seize an opportunity And willing to be used by people, Richard's heart is fretting, maybe I should use this opportunity in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire trial process was finally completed, entered the final link, and was convicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the procedure, one by one, the floating island giants began to express their opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One mechanical voice announces icy It was decided that Richard hesitated and chose to be guilty, so that all the floating islands and the royal family passed the murderous trial of the marshals by ten to five. Since most of the high-rise floating island giants chose to be guilty, the actual number of votes was even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The official stood up and announced in a solemn and solemn voice: "I announced that Marshal Ronald Stade was made in the defensive war of the day. Improper decision-making, in accordance with the law of the Holy Alliance, will remove the rank of Marshal of the Rendezvide League, and remove all military positions, remove the title of the Marquis of Long Dested, and withdraw the territory given by the Alliance, the original The Earl of the Earl and the Earl of the Earl are reserved, Count Rondestede, do you disagree with this judgment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal’s mouth moved, even if it was a smile , said: "No objection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The official knocked on the bronze bell in front of him and announced: "This judgment will take effect immediately."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is still melodious, the agent of the Turan family, the duke’s nephew stood up and yelled: "It’s really noisy, only the idiot will make such a judgment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The officer slammed the bronze bell and sighed: "This is the judgment of the sacred floating island giants." Lord Turan, please respect the order of the House of Lords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order of the shit." The young Turan voice raised again, pointing to the judges in the row. And said: "Is the order able to hold on to the sun and the capital, to condemn the marshal, whoever keeps the sun and the moon, depends on the waste you will only fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The official face is iron and blue, and he is speechless. His position is nominally noble, but under the framework of the Holy Alliance, status is determined by strength, and the sixth layer. The Turan family is right, if there is not the same amount of floating island giants behind it, then the sergeant can't see the sun the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Turan is still not finished, turning to Richard and asking: "Do I have any reason, Lord Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliament hall immediately calmed down and watched the confrontation between the two floating island giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "First, it’s not only the marshal who is involved in the defensive war of the day, but the second, the officials. I can't keep the day, I can't keep changing. You can't keep it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Turan's handsome face is green, Richard This sentence insinuates that he and the judges are all wastes. They sent back what he just said. He is already angry. His shining eyes are staring at Richard. The cold voice asks: "So what do you do?" "Mr. Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed more calmly and said: "This is not important to me. The important thing is, first, I am Most of the Dakso Das who are killed on the battlefield are more than you have killed in your life. Second, if we fight, I have 100% confidence that I can kill you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulan's face turned from green to green, but it was impossible to speak for a long time, screaming and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The officials hurriedly announced the end of the trial, and did not intend to investigate the rudeness of the young Turan, and there was no way to pursue it. The nobles left the House of Lords in twos and threes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial of the Marshal ended, but the follow-up story has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Richard stood on the roof of the Black Rose Castle and watched a team of cavalry slowly leave the military camp and drive to the West. After the Cavaliers, There are another two thousand infantry, and three thousand troops responsible for logistics. This unit will travel to the West to explore the duke of Archimonde, from the black rose castle of Ashan to the western border of the Holy Alliance. The march will take several months, but Richard will take the form of a march, and the pure cavalry will accelerate, and the rest will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops are now gone, and Richard returns to Achilles and said, "Let's go, go to the Valley of the Gold."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Archer swears: "As you wish, the plane portal has been expanded and we can leave at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer immediately, but looked at the distance. On the horizon, a regular truck fleet was slowly coming. From afar to the flag of the truck team, Axiris knew this. It is a cargo team loaded with Knight equipment. In the past three days, this is the second cargo team he saw. The cargo team of this size is loaded with equipment capable of arming one hundred knights to the teeth. Sirius did not feel a slight change in his face, and Richard’s military strength was expanding almost every moment, and he could not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I saw the idea of ​​Achilles. Richard said: "There are eight such a fleet, and I have ordered a full set of high-ranking knights."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand senior knights, even in accordance with the standard of the ordinary giants three thousand gold coins per knight, thousands of knights are also three million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris’s eyes twitched and still respectfully said: “In your hand, Archimonde will shine like never before.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles’s words are not a complete compliment. After thousands of senior knights, they can actually read a lot of things. For example, the Knights’ equipment is definitely not fixed. It can be determined that a military workshop in the Duke’s collar may have less than a thousand sets of knight equipment produced in one year. If it is a knight’s equipment above the standard, the output will be reduced, and the advanced knight equipment is a strategic material. When it reaches a certain scale, it can be bought without money. Richard easily gets a thousand sets of equipment, indicating that at least a few of the forces behind the Duke are fully supporting him behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it’s harder to get people than the Knights’ equipment. Last time Richard’s full recruiting of the Knights and the Preparatory Knights for the entire Archimonde. Almost all of the freedom fighters that Archimonde is willing to join in the army have been wiped out. Now nearly 4,000-step knights have all been equipped with mounts and become real knights. In a short time, Richard has got so many advanced places. knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has equipment, he is still a big builder, and very young. The future of Richard is broad and splendid, and there is no doubt that there is a slight deficiency in personal strength. In addition, it can even be said that Richard’s achievements have been close to Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, Richard himself knows clearly, Achilles is also very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei sighed and said, "Give me some time, I will not be worse than my father. Why can't you help me like a father?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris smiled and said: "Adult, not every subordinate is willing to be a follower, not every follower All of them can have a fraternal sentiment. Everyone of us and the Gotton adults have a story, so in our hearts, Gordon is unique. In fact, you don’t have to worry about it, because it will not affect You lead the Archimonde family forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
