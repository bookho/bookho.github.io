There are still a lot of strong people who can kill dragons on the mainland, but they can kill dragons and powerful people who collect wealth and frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue Midsummer Carnival is therefore becoming popular. Although it is not as large as the three empire's respective auction conferences, the supply of top-quality materials, both in terms of quantity and quality, is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold is busy early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year’s Midsummer Carnival is at least three times the size of the previous session, and this estimate is based only on invitations issued directly by Deep Blue, making it difficult and complex to prepare. The degree has increased by ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue main tower and the edge area have to clean up a large number of areas for the nobles who are scheduled to attend. A large number of caravans, followers, warriors and mercenaries can live in villages and villages outside the dark blue. Black Gold has arranged nearly 10,000 slaves and thousands of craftsmen, and asked to build three new towns in the shortest possible time, and then rent them to visitors. After the midsummer carnival, the three towns can also be used to arrange new immigrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue is becoming more and more prosperous, the role of the port is gradually emerging, the property and fertility of the northern continent are increasingly known to the south, and the huge fleet begins to support Go to the ice floe bay. Now that there is no peak season, the port is already showing signs of saturation, so the long-term black gold has already begun to prepare for the expansion of the port, and with the carnival, the big aristocrats who came to the deep blue have clearly recognized the value of the Northland property. The top material is the brand, the huge basic material is the profit, this is the torrent of rolling gold coins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the strength of Deep Blue exceeds a certain threshold, the ambitious gray dwarf will consider expanding to the North. Yes, the North Continent is the world of the powerful gray dwarves and orcs who are strong and brave, but the polar gray dwarves are also famous for being bought. Black Gold is prepared to gradually erode the gray dwarf tribe with its special identity, and the ultimate purchase target is the Hammer of the Storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blueprint is magnificent. The most important job at the moment is to count the things that the legendary mage throws out to prepare for the auction. Black Gold should sort them out as soon as possible and identify them. Value, the auction reserve price is approved, and then submitted to the artist for the auction catalog. time is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room of hundreds of square meters, all kinds of strange and inexplicable things piled up nearly ten meters high! Under all kinds of sundries, there is still a complete dragon bone! Anyone who is seen by the Necromancer will be crazy about it. However, the mood of the gray dwarf is slightly different. In front of this pile of treasures that must be looked up, he seems so small. It is never an easy task to sort them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of black gold assistants has always been the smallest among the big magisters, so that this time, when he arranged all the work, he found that there was not even one more person left. Yourself. Black gold put a label on a piece of star meteorite, and for the first time began to consider adding people, but as soon as he thought of the gold coins that would be paid out for these people from their own books, the gray dwarf immediately shook his head firmly, with greater enthusiasm. Put into work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle that the legendary Master chooses the auction item is actually very simple. She will make it out of date, can’t figure out the purpose, can’t look good, and can’t put it down. Everything is coming out. As time goes by, the legendary Master's collection is also changing. The first is an increase in absolute numbers, and then the proportion of rare materials and materials taken from rare organisms is rapidly increasing. Another upgraded project is a variety of rare metal minerals that Norland itself does not produce. The common currency between the strong, all kinds of magic crystal, is also increasing steadily. Many of the original rare collections have become more and more difficult to enter the legendary Master's eyes over time, so that they will eventually be cleaned up. The warehouse of the legendary Master's storage is a personally-owned half-face, where there is not much, there will always be a full time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the pair of keels, the core collection of Su Hailun 20 years ago, became a waste of valuable space in 20 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the production of the Mid-summer Auction every four years, the hearts of people can also judge the strength and wealth of the legendary Master through reverse speculation. As the production of the Midsummer Carnival auction is increasingly rich and rare, Deep Blue also sends a clear signal to the mainland's tycoons, that is, the power of the legendary mage is still in a fast-rising channel. Therefore, after each Midsummer Carnival, Deep Blue will usher in a four-year period of rapid prosperity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Midsummer Carnival is a true event in Deep Blue. This is a grand event to realize your dreams. It is an opportunity to skyrocket overnight and is a sudden outbreak. Most of the nobles who come to the dark blue can take the opportunity to expand their network. Ordinary people have several times more opportunities to reach the powers than usual, and they may have opportunities outside of their dreams. Midsummer carnival is still the time of alcohol flooding, and when many girls are dragged into bed when they are willing or reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, three months ago, Deep Blue began preparing for Midsummer Carnival. It’s just that this kind of festival is meaningless for Richard and Stevenson. As always, Richard progressed in accordance with his own suffocating rhythm, and Stevenson was painfully balancing himself and his opponents. Now, due to the strategy of opening the gold coin, Stevenson has never paid much attention to the midsummer carnival. If you can find a few top enchantments from the legendary Master's private lot, it will have a decisive influence on the game's victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several programs offered by Santa Cruz, although the current technical capabilities of Stevenson are not available, the design ideas are valuable if they can be found Specific rare materials can be effectively implemented by substituting their natural effects for technical effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you get an ice dragon tooth, then the snow rabbit can greatly increase the cold resistance, and more frost guns and frost cold stab two new ability. The fire dragon skin can make the snow rabbit get the cold immunity effect, and the winter wolf's talent magic will be invalidated. The magic crystal of the abyss and the beast will make the snow rabbit spray a strong corrosive acid, not to mention the winter wolf, that is, the extreme mammoth is sprayed, and there will be several deep pits on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of rare materials is that it can greatly reduce the difficulty of drawing a magical texture. For example, if the icy resistance of the fire dragon skin can reach 100, then only 10 is enough for the snow rabbit to be immune to the cold attack of the winter wolf. The remaining 90 resistance can be ignored. In other words, because of the strength of the material itself, as long as a small part of the ability is achieved, it is enough to meet the requirements of Santa Cruz, and can also reduce the difficulty to the extent that can be made by Stevenson. And Stevenson has already heard from Black Gold that there are quite a few materials related to dragons in the private inventory sold by legendary mages this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a tricky and extremely wasteful practice, but since the Soram family has invested tens of millions of coins in order to train a builder, then it doesn’t matter Increase the investment by two or three million. Otherwise, the cost already invested becomes meaningless. The gray dwarf was able to see this point, and then the legendary mage made the decision to re-select the disciple of the constructor after half a year. In order to get this quota, the Soram family will definitely put the gold coins into the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the situation since then is as expected by the gray dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at an internal meeting, the Grey Dwarf proudly introduced the results so far and specifically invented the millions of coins invested in the Soram family. A noun is called sunk cost. Because in the eyes of the gray dwarf, this money is like a heavy ship that sinks in the ice floes. Although its sinking will make all the investment into nothing, if you want to rescue it, it will put more ships. Dragged into the sea. The sunk cost is the reason why many people go further and further on the wrong road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
