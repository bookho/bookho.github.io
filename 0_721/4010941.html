			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, is practicing a secret law, some are not convenient." A big priest quickly spoke up and wanted to play round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cultivating the secret law?" Richard laughed and said to the big priest: "You can stand on the platform here and you can get a grace by posing." Time is God's grace, is everything you need, but also need to cultivate what secret method, really think that you become a gods? Even if the sand and Vatican are not there, then it is not her turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big priest looked awkward and wanted to say something, but Richard waved her hand and said faintly: "Since she doesn't give me face, then I don't seem to be polite. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold sè hourglass appeared on the top of Licha, compared with the previous one, because of a large number of sacrifices, the gold on the hourglass The pattern is more and more dense, and there is no trace of loss of grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grace that is enough to clear a big priest is only a small pattern on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a golden sè pattern disappearing on the hourglass, turning into a number of time bands, rushing to the top of the Dragon Temple, and merging into the endless time In the sea. At this moment, the Dragon Hall faintly shakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the Dragon Hall, an exclamation sounded! Then the gods saw that the lines on the hourglass of Richard's time were obviously two fewer, and then they became screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, a circular arc-shaped gold sè light blade suddenly appeared, sweeping across the horizontal direction, and intercepting the time belt of the connection between the dragon and the dragon hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a temporary mitigation of the crisis, Richard sneered and stood there, the time hourglass slowly rotates. Although he stopped his hand, the great priests only felt the heavier pressure, because they all heard the person who exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a figure rushed and rushed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good young woman, her eyebrows are all natural arrogance, but at this moment the anger has destroyed her perfect face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a gorgeous and elegant robes, but it is broken and ruined everywhere. Many of the powerful magic pendants above are dull at the moment and are clearly ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and down at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priests of the Eternal and Time Dragon are all very young, time is completely meaningless to them, and the body and appearance can always remain at the most Young state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the owner, the famous West Fa, is not too old. She is also a well-known genius in the past, and she has received many eternal and time-honored dragons, so she can pass the legendary mark at a young age and be able to take charge of the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! You are too arrogant, here is the Eternal Dragon Temple!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard is not convinced of her anger, said faintly: "You also know that this is the eternal dragon temple, then you should know, here, my place Everything you do is not arrogant, at least for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westfa was shocked and his face became dignified. Her eyes were stunned and staring at Richard in disgust, as if she wanted to see through his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has experienced countless lives and deaths, and such a gaze can of course not affect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood unconsciously, his eyes daringly walking up the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This famous priest is of superb body, and the broken robes reveal a large amount of snowy and creamy skin. And because she was so angry that her body was slightly trembled, these skins also faintly faintly fascinated, revealing the ultimate temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of Richard’s gaze, Xifa’s face was cold, but surprisingly did not choose to burst on the spot, but turned his eyes to the left and right, saying coldly: "You go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple quit the hall according to the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Law also glanced at the big priests and said, "What should you do if you should do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although several great priests were not very willing, they were forced to retreat due to the majesty of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the official appointed by Richard had hesitated and insisted on standing there. She is very clear that as soon as she left, it is possible for Richard to make a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presiding in a sacrifice by Richard, the grace of the proceeds may be the sum of the past few years. With such a huge grace, she would rather offend the West and never give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xifa glanced at the priest and said coldly, "Okay, you are very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately looked at Richard, raised her eyebrows, and said with a little provocative look: "Then we will go to my private temple to talk about it, how, dare to go?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you are in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, there is no place I dare not go to?" Richard said. He patted the selected face of the priest and said, "Wait for me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is a happy face, she knows I bet my own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Law snorted and headed forward, and the arrogance that appeared in the gait could not be said. She led Richard forward, and then suddenly the light and shadow changed around, and Richard had been pulled into her own private temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very empty space, a huge time hourglass floating in the blue sky, constantly throwing the light of gold to the earth. In this world, it is the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot of Richard is a soft carpet-like grass, not far from the endless ocean, a sea cháo rushes to the beach, washing with soft and fine When the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass zhōng yāng, there is a small forest, the corners of a small house in the lush foliage, where the residence of the West is supposed to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very beautiful world. Richard took two steps. The scenery changed and he found that the grass was originally on a small island. Endless sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a little away from the sea, you can clearly see the vast array of sè-colored fish in the blue and pure water. Many fish are even called by Richard. No name. It seems that Xifa is very careful about the operation of this small world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled slightly, and she already had some understanding of her xìng. He pointed to the direction of the cabin and said, "Are we standing here to talk? Or go there and see, I am very interested in where you live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western law would have barely kept the cold face angry again, and said: "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no way to refuse, don't forget, Here is the Temple of Eternal Dragon. In the Dragon Hall, only the authority in front of the old dragon is really useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard reaches out into the sky The hourglass of the time pointed out that the hourglass that had been slowly swirling suddenly stopped, and the whole world was also frozen at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves at sea disappeared, and the fish floated in the water like a stay, and did not move. Time is still running, but the power that drives the world to run is stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about, don't take me to your residence to see?" Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westfa bite the lower lip, God is complicated, and finally walked to the cabin first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee reveals a playful smile and goes with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xifa is smart, proud, and powerful, but at the same time quite able to control himself. What Richard likes most is this kind of opponent, because they will make a judgment after weighing the pros and cons. The so-called rationality is actually a compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Western law is really the kind of person who can do whatever it takes, Richard should be cautious. The chief priest is such a person. She is determined and extremely tough. She will not compromise on Richard. Therefore, Richard is also not polite, directly cutting her gods to zero, and then expelling the eternal dragon temple and completely ruining it. The future of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin is not big, but the layout is elegant and elegant. Every piece of decoration is very careful, and any details are perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the hut, you can't see any extravagant and flamboyant decorations, but naturally it feels very comfortable. Seeing this, Richard’s evaluation of Western law has quietly stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin has only three or four rooms, one bedroom, one study, one small living room and kitchen, and then there is no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this private shrine, if Xifa is willing, she can build a magnificent palace, but she only created such a cabin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has walked through every room, seen it, and sometimes picks up some monuments to play for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Face is all unnatural and even a little nervous. When Richard visited this way, it was the same as peeping into her inner world, which naturally made her feel extremely uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is no way for Western France to find out its own vulnerability in the face of Richard’s extreme strength. Unless she is willing to be ruined like a chief priest and expelled from the Dragon Hall, she can only compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already demonstrated his power and incredible grace. Just a short-lived confrontation, Richard has taken the upper hand and captured most of the Dragon Hall. Control, she bombarded her very embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few bombardments, Xifa lost a lot of grace, and she was deeply deplored, but also quietly produced a deep horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows the rules of eternity and the dragon of time, and how much grace she has robbed her, how much grace she has to pay. However, in the bombardment, Richard was like a god, and the power of bombardment time was like a mad cháo, annihilating her a lot of time and grace. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she had to endure a lot of divine grace, forcibly cut off Richard’s control over the Eternal Dragon Hall, I am afraid that the end will be even worse. In this war, her accumulation in the past decade has vanished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Western Law is not willing to admit it, she is indeed afraid. She is reluctant to have a bright future, and she is reluctant to give up the status and glory of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, it would be ridiculous for her to lose these reasons, just to be unhappy with Richard? After all, there is no direct hatred between her and Richard, and there is no huge family interest behind the chief priest, and there is a conflict that is difficult to reconcile with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
