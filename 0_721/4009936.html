			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine has put on the ancestral magic armor, wiped the habit The sabre, then strode to the main entrance of the castle, majesticly ordered: "Ignition!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards immediately passed orders, located throughout the castle The brazier was lit at the same time, and the surrounding of the castle was shining brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another crow hula that flew out of several towers, either on the roof or in a circle around the night sky. These crows have a pair of blood-red eyes, but they are not big, but they belong to the middle-level Warcraft. Their eyes can naturally see through invisibility, so the dusk castle that has domesticated such a group of red crows has almost no possibility of being attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine sits still in the city, not in a hurry. The dusk castle is in a state of war. Generally speaking, the soldiers are always on alert for a day, and the best state of physical energy is a few hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the eyes of Richard, this is the sagacity of Baron Fontaine. If Sinclair sees that the castle at dusk has been strictly guarded and does not attack for a while, then at noon tomorrow, the team from the Duke’s escort will arrive, and the leader is a sanctuary who will defend the castle. The power is further enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the castle does not fall, the Baron’s foundation will not be hurt. Baron Fontaine’s move is to defeat the soldiers without fighting, and it is best to let Sinclair retreat. As for the future, the Duke, the Temple and the Sanctuary will naturally kill the woman who dared to invade the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not as confident as Baron Fontaine. The baron didn't know Norland and didn't know Sinclair, so this hard battle was almost inevitable in his judgment. However, the brigade and the mother's nest are coming to this side. The two groups of wind teeth led by the two elite elites have already surpassed the mother's nest, and it is only five kilometers away from the dusk castle. Every minute after the time, Richard will be safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the night is the deepest time. The thick fog floating from the lake has covered the entire dusk castle and gradually spread to the outside of the lake. Even if you are in the castle, you can only see some light and blurred architectural outlines when you are far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine sat quietly, although there is now a huge unease in his heart, but there is no panic from his face. He is also a strongman of the 14th grade. Moreover, because the dusk castle is a territory that has been passed down from generation to generation, many souls of the ancestors rested here, so his perception is extremely sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable relief emerges, Baron Fontaine knows that Sinclair has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is coming." Baron Fontaine said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up, but saw that the baron still did not move, so he leaned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron put the sword on his lap and said calmly: "Lee, you said she dared to attack my castle?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no choice but to smile, think about it, or decide to tell the truth: "With the arrogant style of the woman who defeated the coalition, I guess she probably didn't even need a break. But directly attack the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine listened, said nothing, but the hand holding the sword was quietly clenching the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred meters away from the castle, a thick fog suddenly rushed, and the lion lion came out of the fog silently, and Sinclair was lazy on the back of the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lion, one after another, the konjac stepped out, their heavy horseshoes fell, and the earth would tremble slightly, without any sound. . These konjac bring their own magical power, and when they are able to launch, they can conceal all the sounds they make. Silent behavior is the most important ability to stand out from the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred meters apart, there is a thick fog, but it is not a problem for Sinclair. Her eyes narrowed and she stared at the castle town at dusk, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great magician frowned and said, "How can it be so full of guards? This kind of readiness is just mobilization and in place for more than an hour, do they Are there other enemies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they are waiting for me. I have already seen Richard." Sinclair turned to the two great magicians nearby. I took a look and said, "It seems that the two wolves we met on the road are weird, or are there those magical communication devices on the sprinters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's weird, as long as you catch Richard, don't you understand it?" A great magician said that in his eyes, the local indigenous powers were weak and inconsistent with the level. He has no problem dealing with two or three great wizards at the same level. Although Richard is also from Noland, he is still young, but not more than ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks well!" Sinclair straightened his body and gently stroked his sexy lips with his hand and said, "Take offense!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinarily tall town bear knight leader urges the konjac and moves forward. The konjac's footsteps are getting faster and faster, and it is quickly added to the speed, and it is straight toward the main entrance of the dusk castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors on the castle have already discovered the town bear knights from the fog, the soldiers are full of longbows, and then a dozen long arrows roar! The arrow rain is astonishing, and there is almost no deviation. It seems that the baron usually does not spend less on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the arrow rain, the leader of the town bear knight just opened his mouth and laughed a few times, not at all! Lee Arrow was in the middle of him and the konjac, but most of the arrows were bounced off, a few successful Sunder Armor, but the damage caused is very small, whether it is the town bear knight leader or the konjac are unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers rushed straight to the wall less than 30 meters before they screamed and threw the tomahawk in their hands! The battle axe whirls in the air, making a screaming scream, drawing an arc in the air and coming to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle axe shot, the face of Baron Fang Dan immediately stunned. The power of this axe, even he did not dare to lightly block! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the town bear knight leader Tomahawk came out, Richard had already left his seat and jumped out. The people under his hands also evaded early. Richard knows the power of the magical pattern and knows the true power of the bear knight. He is not willing to face the full strength of the 16th-level powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontain also made the best judgment immediately, screaming and slamming, and then he first fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Baron, many of the guards and fighters who were originally prepared to block the axe by force also fell on the ground for the first time. And a few hesitant struggles, and the defenders who felt that they were detrimental to the warriors or nobles did not fall, but tried to block them with weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
