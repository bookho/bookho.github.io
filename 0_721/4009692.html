			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the girl image was placed in front of Black Gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf allowed the Master to wait for forty minutes before crawling out of the gemstone ore that was full of the entire workbench and blocked half of the channel, and then used I listened to the master's instructions for a minute. Dark blue is the world of magic and the world of gold coins, but there is no art or anything. The gray dwarf has one foot on the mountainside of the magical peak, and the other foot is on the summit of the mountain of gold coins. Therefore, although his height has just touched the master's chest, the psychological height is just the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's Note The Grey Dwarf did not listen to a few words at all. He skipped all the explanatory sentences and grasped the key points, Richard's work, Su Helun One of the circumstances in which His Highness specifically requested reporting. Hearing here, the black gold did not dare to neglect, with the hard and rough, covered with the thick and hard of the old man's hand comparable to the Warcraft scales, carefully tearing open the wrapping paper, revealing the girl inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf’s eyes stared at the girl’s image almost at the same time, and the lips quickly opened up, not knowing what to say. The master was deeply shocked. He did not expect that Black Gold could see the rhythm of the painting and tremble. The master suddenly felt that he had some prejudice against the gray dwarf. Who said that this race did not understand art at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold suddenly spit out a suffocating sigh, licking his eyes and saying, "Just like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Ah? Yes..." The master was a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This painting has not been colored yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master struggled to restrain the heart that jumped fast and slow, and after a long breath, he reluctantly replied: "This is a plain painting." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf suddenly realized that he had re-examined the girl’s image and said: "Well, it’s not fully developed yet, but the body and length should be very general. I follow you. According to human standards, if we follow the tradition of our Storm Hammer, oh... Ah! I saw, that lunch box! That is the lunch box specially prepared for Richard! It’s the perfect details and proportions. Even a line can't pick the deviation, it's Richard's style! You know, the Luo Dan Magister who taught the magic circle has already praised him three times this week. How many times has it been this year? Let me think about it, five Ten or seventy.... Anyway, a lot! You know, the old guy hasn’t praised others so many times in the past ten years! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master can't tell his own feelings, and can't erupt on the black gold. He can only patiently guide: "Look carefully, the moment the picture captures... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray dwarfs look carefully, look again, look over and over again.... Finally, I feel that this painting should be painted in color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left Black Gold’s office, the master’s heart was almost as dark as Richard’s, and the unprecedented frustration made him almost lose his artistic confidence. He never understood why this master of jewellery, magical equipment and antiques knew nothing about painting, and every spoken word was deeply attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the master, the two bronze doors in the gray dwarf office area slowly closed. The height of the gate is double that of the normal area, which means that the height of the gray dwarf office area is double that of others. Therefore, these two quaint and luxurious doors representing wealth and status have always been the objects of many people in the deep blue. The reason why the gray dwarf, whose height is only half of the tall man, has made his office area so high is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed, the gray dwarf behind the door suddenly sneered and muttered: "The joy of the boss, how easy is it?" In the cabinet, if this girl figure is included, the event that wants to make Su Helun 'joy' has been piled up with more than half of the cabinets, a total of 67 pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf instinctively went to the gemstone ore, but frowned, took his footsteps, folded back to the office desk, and reopened the girl’s image, carefully examining it. Ten minutes later, this was closed, hesitated, and put this portrait into another small one. The small cabinet is also an event or report that wants He Hailun to be 'pleasant', but the total is only five, and the painting is placed in the second position. Unlike the big cabinet, the report in this cabinet will soon meet the legendary mage. And the things in the big cabinet may be dumped like a waste mine in a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole summer, for Richard, it seems to have passed in a blink of an eye. Another day, the harvest festival was ushered in, the beginning of the fall and the end of the ice floe fishing season. On this day, millions of people who make a living by the sea in the ice floe will hold a grand celebration, thanking the sea god for giving him a long and harsh winter food. The dark blue in the ice floes also takes this day as a holiday, which is a sign of official entry into the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest festival has no meaning for Richard. All his time is to complete the arduous work that can hardly be done forever, that is, the magic of meditation accumulation, and Exercise magic techniques. He has to fill up his own time, otherwise his thoughts will come up in a string like a blisters. Press this side and float up there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the harvest festival, Irene arrived at Richard’s residential area on time and sent his dinner. The heavy lunch box has made the girl very hard to rely on, but in the foreseeable future, the lunch box will continue to increase weight. When Richard was burying his head to clean the food, Eileen sat quietly and looked at it silently. There is no longer a gold coin transaction between the two people, and even few words are said. Therefore, during this time, Irene did not get a gold coin from Richard. Eating is now a torment for Richard. The girl’s melancholy can’t be overwhelmed by her, but she refuses to disclose the reason. Therefore, Richard is suffering, but he is powerless to pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of snack was swallowed by Richard with a tenacious will, then he looked up for the first time looking directly at the girl, habitually wanting to say thank you, but The rows of figures on the girl's body made him stiff on the spot! The girl's body has changed. In the digital field of vision, the original subtle changes have been infinitely magnified, and it is extremely prominently presented in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ** has increased a little, and the left and right are not balanced, obviously not natural growth, but because of external injuries. And her movements are also very unnatural, especially when the legs occasionally tremble gently, and the waist keeps moving quietly. It seems that sitting on a cushion covered with heavy brocade will make her feel stinging. The girl's eyes are slightly swollen, redder than usual, and seem to cry too soon. Today, the girl's magician's robe is wrapped in extraordinarily strict, but in the inadvertent movement, it reveals a bruise on the neck. And her heartbeat is much faster than usual. Compared to Richard himself, only when I have experienced something very important, will my heart jump so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the signs put together, and immediately let Richard’s mind come up with an answer, an answer that made him feel completely unbelievable. At the age of eleven, Richard did not understand the enlightenment of the noble children at the age of seven or eight, but now he is eleven and a half years old, and Irene took him through most of the road, so I already knew it. Everything that must happen between adult men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
