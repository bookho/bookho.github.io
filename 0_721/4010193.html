More than a dozen profit arrows screamed out from the forest! Most of them are warriors who shoot at logging, and three long arrows that are obviously entangled in natural forces are shot at this group of people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long waited for this moment. At the moment when the long arrow strikes, he does not do any protective action on himself, but his eyes are tightly locked. Direction, waving the fate of Gemini. In an instant, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky, and it was hidden in a shooter deep in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agamemnon around him is still carrying the big exaggerated hammer, and between the waves, the colorful rays of the hammers are suddenly skyrocketing. If a line suddenly pops up countless thread ends, it will slam the long arrow that attaches to the natural force, and it will be tightly wrapped once contacted. The colorful light was bright again, re-splitting into numerous threads, and then retracted into the light of the hammer. The previous long arrow was not even visible to the dregs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of Li did not stop, and took out the book of the bearing, quickly flipped, a flash of water blue magic flashed, and the depth of the forest suddenly rose cold. With a click, a young elf who is escaping quickly is frozen in the ice that appears in large chunks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf girl next to her screams, pulled out a short knife, slammed into the ice, and wanted to rescue her companions. However, the short knife only penetrated a little, and it was no longer allowed to enter. Instead, a piece of ice spread along the short knife and quickly covered the girl's hand with a layer, and even the girl was chilled into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf elder screamed, and the bone blade in his hand slammed on the ice! The ice is flying all over, but the effect is almost nothing. The ice formed by the magical power is still spreading upwards over the girl's arm. The face of the elf elders flashed a trace, and suddenly pulled out the short knife and cut the girl's forearm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never dared to stop, and picked up the girl and fled to the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the seven levels of magical cold is not that these ordinary elves can resist. In the environment of Green Sen, the effects of extreme cold and lightning will be enlarged accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, a tall and mighty elf warrior saw it all, and the anger suddenly surged. He stopped and nailed it firmly on a trunk that was almost the same as his long bow! The longbow is slowly full and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Nyris, who is far away from a hundred meters, suddenly has an ear, a finger hook, and a handleless blade like a willow. Jumped into his hand and was gently rubbed by the index finger of his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior suddenly released his finger, and the bowstring screamed, and the long arrow was out like electricity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Nyris did not look at it and waved a sloppy blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silent electric fire on the blade, which seems to break through the limits of time and space. Just flew out of the hands of Nyris, it has already appeared in the amount of the Elf Warrior. before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior’s face was full of doubtful expressions. He seemed to see something, but it flashed away and could not catch it. However, he could not see a thin blood mark on his eyebrows. The blade passed through the head, and the rest did not rest, disappearing deep in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Warrior shook a little and planted it from the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Nyris took an understatement and took off the long arrow that was shot at his throat. He watched it in his hand, lightly as if he had just A leaf fell on the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The action is very handsome, but if it is mine, I will shoot you with a magical burst arrow next time." Richard commented on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s face was immediately black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a magical bursting arrow, then Nyris’s gameplay must have been blown up. He is equipped very well, although he can't see it, it is not expected to be weak, so the injury is not necessarily, but the head is the most difficult part to protect, when it is difficult to say how much hair can be kept. In the war between Nolande humans and elves, there were many human powers who had suffered from the bursting arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this method not only available to Norland's elves? These indigenous people are not so smart!" Nyris was very convinced. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "That's not necessarily. If they are forced to rush, anything can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being attacked by Richard and Nyris with Thunder, the Greenson Elves seemed to be shocked and never appeared again. The soldiers have thus increased their confidence, and the rock and wood have been cut down. Richard can almost hear the whine of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felled rock was dragged back to the city. If left unchecked, they will be absorbed by other trees and become new forest nutrients. Although rock wood can not be used as building materials, it burns for a while on fire. It can burn for a long time after it is successfully ignited. It is a very good fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the amount of rock felled this time, it was too late to transport, so I had to leave it in place. After cutting down a whole morning, until most of the soldiers were exhausted, more than 10,000 trees were cut down, and a lot of open space was cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard, Nyris and Agamemnon ran out of the horse and took the protection of the logging team. If the Green Sens are dare to attack, then the counterattacks of the strongmen here are fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another three days. When it was Neris to play, the four emperors went deep into the forest and went after the attacking elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the chaos begin? Afterwards, even the Nyris’s guards couldn’t say why, but only one thing is certain, it’s obviously the elves’ thoughtfulness. The trap that was laid out is to bring out the strong people sitting on the side of the human body in order to achieve the purpose of breaking each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Nyris slammed into it and broke into a short battle in the depths of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Warriors jumped out of the trees like ghosts, holding deadly short knives in both hands. There are also countless elf shooters between the crowns and leaves, and a bundle of arrows whistling. The trees were instantly resurrected, and they pulled the roots out of the ground one by one, waving huge branches to Neris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s smile on his face is a trap or a big meal delivered to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly clenched the handle of the axe, and a long, clear shiver in his mouth, the heavy and legendary Tomahawk in his hand was as light as a feather! Neri's body also became as if there was no weight, fluttering out, and it seemed to be flying with a tomahawk. He passed by a tree man, and the giant axe gently passed over the tree. The tree man made a scream, the hard trunk became extremely fragile, and it was instantly divided into two sections, which were slipped open. You can see that the cut surface left by the giant axe is as smooth as a mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the tree people can't stop the giant axe, and the Green Sen Elf Warrior is even more vulnerable. The legendary axe is circling around the Nethers, and the Elf Warriors will be cut into two pieces even if they are stained! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, a team of fully armed Royal Warriors are running, rushing all the way to the direction of Niris. They have long been left behind by the four emperors, and now they only want to be able to arrive in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running all the way, when the royal soldiers finally arrived at the scene of the fierce battle, the Green Sens are constantly sending out shouts representing the retreat, gradually reaching the depths of the forest. mobile. Their whistling sounds are full of pain and helplessness, and a little bit of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is screaming at the legendary axe and gasping with a big mouth. There was abnormal flushing on his face, sweat was pouring out like spring water, and seven or eight long arrows were inserted in the armor, most of which were cracked in the hands of the master of art. Around Nyris, it is like a storm crossing, full of weapons, corpses, and the broken torso of the tree. A little bit, you can tell the body of at least a dozen trees and more than fifty elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no relief from the wounds of the Royal Warriors. He has been following Nyris for a long time, and he is very aware of how perverted the defensive armor defenses of the Emperor. The arrow of the ordinary elf shooter is impossible to shoot through the armor. Even the block is unnecessary. Even the high-order shooter's arrow has a magical effect. In the storm that the legendary axe has set off, it is only swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this battle, the Green Senss seemed to have disappeared, and there was no attack on Richard’s logging forces. In the case of the tribal Green Sens, the war of Niris killed more than half of the warriors of a small tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the Greenson Elves made revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early morning of this day, the guards guarding the walls suddenly shouted in horror. The officer of the rotation quickly rushed to the head of the city and looked out in the direction of the guard's finger. His face was also extremely ugly. He immediately sent a soldier to inform the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Dragon Master arrived first, she flew directly from the magic tower. Then Richard and others also arrived. They stood in the city, silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the open space outside the city, I don’t know when there are more than a dozen big trees. Trees that suddenly appear like this are all elves driven by secret methods. Only the elves have driven thousands of trees to drive trees, but this time they only sent more than a dozen trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trees are special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tree has one or several human warriors hanging from the trunk. Half of their bodies are trapped in the tree and have grown completely with the trees. You can see dozens of vines coming into their bodies and then coming out from another place. The soldiers’ mouths and noses even grow many branches with fresh branches and leaves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These warriors have already died, but their bodies have been completely deformed and their faces are distorted. Obviously the pain of death is intense and long. Their bodies are all filled with plants. In other words, these warriors are alive and eaten by these big trees! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s eyes swept over these fighters and suddenly covered her mouth, and there was already a layer of moisture in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, standing next to Master Long, asked, "Do you know them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
