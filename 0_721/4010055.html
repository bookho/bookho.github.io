			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the crowd, Elvin is also crowded forward, a little bit Move to the transmission array. Efforts to behave like others, that is, not outstanding, not too weak. All in all, you can't let others recognize themselves easily from the crowd because they are afraid again. After Richard’s sudden return, Elvin did not close his eyes again. When Richard smashed Charles's head, Elvin hid not far away and witnessed everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no instinctive feeling of conspiracy without dare to leave immediately. Richard returned to the floating island with great arrogance, and forcedly left the Baron of Suya with no mercy. How could it let these troublemakers leave safely? Perhaps waiting for these people at the other end of the transmission array is a big knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irvine is still somewhat mindful, not only do he think so, but the instructors who train the knights think so. I thought about it carefully and thought it would be safer to stay for a while to see the wind. The return of Richard is absolutely unwilling to be seen by many wealthy people. The reason why these giants have not started with Archimonde is that the time when Gotton disappeared is not long enough. But when Richard returned, it was enough to stimulate these giants to take immediate action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, there will be changes. Elvin constantly persuaded himself to make himself more confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is no waiting for the intervention of the giants, but the return of the three knights of Asiris, Semma and Lina! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three knights sitting on the floating island, which giants will consider again and again before taking public action. So Elvin decided to leave immediately. In the past turmoil, but the backbone, it is impossible to get away with it. In order to resent, in order to gain more benefits, the consequences are finally revealed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irvine did not understand Richard, nor could he understand Richard’s thoughts. I don’t know that Richard did not intend to rely on the three knights to deal with them. But on the other hand, there is nothing wrong with it, that is, Richard will never let them go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first five people disappeared into the transmission array, and RrYd immediately turned to Elvin. Just breathed a sigh of relief, suddenly a horizontal sword sticking out in front of you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why stop me? Elvin asked, a hint of fierceness on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one step away from the transmission array, so that you can't help but have a strong idea. But what stopped was a middle-aged Archimonde, with a faint murderousness all over the body, not knowing how many battles he had experienced in the past years. Such a person, Irvine is very clear, even if it is two levels lower than himself, in the life and death battle, he is not an opponent. So wisely did not do anything superfluous and out of the ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Middle-aged Archimonde had no expression on his face, revealing a hint of disdain, and adults have orders! Any family warrior, including the stepping knight, must not leave the floating island! The family warrior should be the sword that guards the blood, and in the eyes, these few in front of the broken iron and iron are not counted, obviously insulting the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin Fury: Which adult's order? Why not let us leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the order! A cold voice came from the side, and immediately let Ervin and all the soldiers who were not allowed to leave to chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi, this woman has been forced to push down on the number of people, no matter how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashick flashed a sneer in his eyes and said: As for why, do you need RrYd to explain it? Do you really think that the rules of the family are just furnishings, and that RrYd can only do what you want by relying on people? Any one of you, RrYd, dare to step into the transmission array and press the deserter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all countries of the mainland, all ethnic groups, the punishment means for the former deserters are the same, hehe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the person of the Marquis of Gordon, what is the right to dispose of us! A thick warrior screamed and pushed open an Archimonde that blocked himself, and wanted to rush into the transmission. However, suddenly an orange glow flashed in front of him, and then the horizon fell into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irvine saw with his own eyes that there was a blood line in the center of the soldier’s body, and then the whole person was divided into two halves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The separate body of the warrior can still jump forward two steps, then the half piece falls, and the other half falls into the transmission array. A flash of light flashed, and half of the body and internal organs disappeared. From the beginning to the end, no one has seen how Fasqi is doing it, only knowing that she is out of the hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was wasted the magic crystal of the transmission array. Faschi faintly commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no one dares to question her authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two preparatory battle knights wanted RrYd to sneak away in the crowd, but they were also directly taken out by Faschi, and they cut their heads on the spot! Since then, no one has ever tried to fish in troubled waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the branch family slipped away from the floating island, all the soldiers were left behind, but did not tell them what to do next, No one has restricted their actions except that they are not close to the transmission array. The more undisposed the news, the more afraid we are. If you really don't plan to do anything for them, you won't stop them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Elvin is sleepless all night. I don't know what my fate will be tomorrow. The original promised to support the giants are also silent. Only by thinking about the sacrifice that should have arrived at the family, and thinking about how it can bring changes to the whole family, to enhance their courage. Originally, I wanted to use this sacrifice on myself. It seems that now, this opportunity is likely to disappear forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I’m lucky or unfortunate, Irvine didn’t know that RmoP’s sacrifice was a sneak peek. It’s not enough to initiate even a first-class sacrifice. . I thought I could change my destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the floating island was very quiet, many people did not know where to go, and the three knights did not show up. The uneasy soldiers who have participated in the riots still don’t know. Today is the day when Richard released the decoration, and it is also the first step to formally participate in the mainland office as a builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusual downtown area of ​​Fu Shide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest event of today is naturally the decoration conference, and it is two simultaneous events! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luno’s assembly conference was set up more than a month ago as a royal ambassador of the Holy Alliance, impacting the fourth-order construction Luno’s high-profile organizing conference for several years has naturally aroused widespread interest, and it is clear that there will be new progress. Once Luno officially made the fourth-order structure, it would not be good news for any country other than the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
