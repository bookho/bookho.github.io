			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond's face is getting paler, the order is getting faster and faster, The impassioned voice kept echoing over the battlefield. He gathered the formation, formed a chiseling force, and tried his best to attack the top of the hill where Richard was standing! In his view, as long as the Richard who stood at the top of the hill was knocked down and the flag that was still flying was broken, the Faro army would lose all morale and begin to collapse. Moreover, the biggest goal of his army leading to Faro is not to occupy this plane, but to eradicate Richard! And capture his forward base and time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the situation on the battlefield became the ambush of Richard’s troops around Raymond’s troops, and Raymond led the army to fight desperately. Richard's defense line, Richard himself is the pro-rate of the troops based on the hilly terrain, deadly to withstand the crazy impact of Raymond forces! As long as Richard can withstand, then the Noland army can break through, and there are only a few remaining soldiers, which is not enough. If the position of Richard is cut through, the defeat will become a Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this tens of meters high, not too big on the hills, both fighters have red eyes, every inch of land is in a desperate fight ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle quickly became a melee, and the strong players on both sides had fought and fought together. At the most critical time, even Richard himself had to personally rush into the front line, killing the Norland soldiers from the position with a dazzling knives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also made the coalition’s aristocratic generals stunned, even the Duke of Glasgow could not help but say in the battle, “I heard that you are a The Great Sorcerer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was shrugged, and the long knife in his hand was sheathed, and the white blade was still bloody. "The magician can also learn a little self-defense." In the case where the two strikers have crossed and glued, he has to command the side to kill the enemy. There is no second mouth to sing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is getting more and more fierce, and Richard’s nephew has been shouted, and his body is sticky, and he can’t tell whether it’s blood or sweat. Looking around, it seems that every corner of the entire hill is smashing, bloody and suffocating everywhere, can not stop drilling into the nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody battle is still going on, it seems that there is no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to be slowing down suddenly, and the feeling is a bit fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know when the magic had dried up, and the enemies in front of him seemed to kill. If you cut down one, there will be another one. He even began to succumb to the use of magic, but to input the rest of the magic into the magical armed forces, to solve the opponent with combat skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s head is violently hurting, the wisdom of talent has reached its limit, and the enemy has already attacked the front. More often, Richard can only In order to cope with the battle before the eyes, you can take a moment to glance at the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant sky, a red dragon is flying soaring, chasing a big magister, and Lina himself and another magister are fierce Fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf and the Duke of Glasgow are working together against a gray old man, but still doing the best. If not the two dukes have activated the ultimate ability of the ancestors, and the sands and the Russian and Russian gods do not conflict with the ancestors, the two of them may not support it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard's consciousness, all the followers are fiercely fighting, and the elite units have encountered obstacles. The Noland warriors are like a wall, firmly standing in front of them, saying nothing. Fall down. Every crack that has been painstakingly opened will be filled in an instant, and the line will never seem to be torn open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, from the picture back from the air, everything is not so desperate. The rear of Raymond is loosening, and the horrible humanoid knight is as slow as a cutting machine, but it is pressed into the Noland camp in an inch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the Norland Warriors are not strong enough, but the humanoid knight is terrible. They have a competitive advantage over the ordinary Noland warriors. They are even more fearless in the battle. They don’t mind if they change their wounds with the Nolanders. What is even more frightening is that no matter how heavy the injury is, as long as it is not completely disabled, it will hardly affect their killing. Such an opponent, anyone who encounters it will be afraid, even the most fierce fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stirred up the remaining magic, and flew up into the sky, pointing to the front with a long knife stained with blood, roaring: "My soldiers! Look Arrived? Our flag is still flying!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, countless Faro soldiers look back and see the air in the air, seeing the hunting and flying Blood-stained battle flag! Then an earth-shattering trench was issued! The Noland warrior, who seems to be omnipotent, met the real enemy for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time!" Richard stabbed another Noland warrior who tried to climb the stone tower and issued the final order in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth suddenly vibrates, and after a stone pillar in the distance, thirty-six knights are listed as sharp arrows, and they are rushing at full speed! The headed knight is particularly prominent, wearing a huge helmet, holding a tomahawk, and squatting under the magical height of the magical riding, the most striking is the emblem of the volcanic world tree in the breastplate. It is the Gangde who has been leading the army in Faro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only thirty-six rides, when the rush comes, the momentum has to overwhelm the army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who screamed: “The Arch of Knights of Archimonde!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nearly the Nolanders had a little chaos, looking in the direction of the hoof. No matter which plane you are in, the appearance of the Knights of the Knights will attract attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond saw the number of knights in the costumes, and suddenly they were struck by lightning, and the brain was blank! He did not think that Richard actually had a full 36 rider in the Faro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Raymond used the Fifty-Five Knight to directly pierce the front line of the Baroque War, and killed the Baroque King in one fell swoop. The sixteen-ride knights are also enough to cut through Raymond’s relatively weak post-war formation. And the Nolanders who are in the strength of the army, once they lose the strict team shape, are how to be elite and will be slaughtered. In order to stop the disaster that will come, only the knights or the real strong can stop them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Constructing the Cavaliers, our knights..." Raymond just thought of it, suddenly a cold heart. The original 50-riding Knights have only had more than a dozen rides, and in order to break through the defense line, they have also been grouped into various corners of the battlefield, and it is too late to assemble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a critical juncture, Raymond screamed: "Mr. Crest, stop them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A strong sanctuary came up with a four-meter gun in his hand. The whole body was full of enthusiasm, and the dazzling blue light was shining, preparing to forcibly intercept Gangde and the Knights of the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a Sanctuary strongman, a knight who wants to block up to 36 rides in front of him is dead. But now, if you don't stop them, the battle will collapse immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleist's face is solemn, and he is rushing to the Arch of Knights in an unparalleled position. In the distance, a Nolander Magi rushed in, and as long as Kleist could resist the first impact, he would get a backup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, an indescribable dangerous atmosphere suddenly enveloped his entire body and mind! The sanctuary, named Kleist, turned back and saw an unspeakable behemoth as soon as he saw a huge stone pillar not far away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of this horrible creature that is tens of meters long and nearly ten meters high, Klester feels that he is as insignificant as a worm, although he The giants facing the face are really like a bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the mother's nest, at the most critical moment, personally enter the battlefield's mother's nest. At the moment, its dozens of compound eyes have been fixed on Kleist, just like watching a prey under the claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caverns are cold and almost impossible to move! That is the pressure from the depths of the soul. However, the instinct of the battle for many years allowed him to react immediately. The vindictiveness rushed to the extreme, and instantly got rid of the suppression. After a flash, he appeared on the top of the nest and tried his best to stab his rifle to the head of the nest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the gun and the head of the mother's nest actually sounded a metal beep, and the strong force of the Sanctuary was shot with a full force, only about ten centimeters. For the one-meter round head of the mother's nest, it is obvious that the shell is not pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleist’s face is flushed with strange flushes, and he is struggling to burn his temper. He has reached a high level in the sanctuary, and his instinct makes him feel in front of him. This Warcraft-like thing is even more dangerous than Archimonde's Knights. At the cost of his own re-creation, he made a sudden effort to go far beyond his usual level. The long shots flashed on the front of the gun, and the guns began to groan and tremble as if they had their own lives! The head of the nest was quickly covered with cracks, and then burst under the raging raging temper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally got rid of it..." Kleist’s heart was loose, and the feeling of emptiness after excessive force was born. Although I don't know what the hen's nest is, I can imagine what kind of disaster it would be like to make such a giant rush into the ranks of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Kleist suddenly saw a lot of cracks in the place where he stood, and then he looked out from the inside. I stared at him all together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, before Kleist reacted, there was a strange scream in the consciousness, and then a mental shock like a hammer Knocking on his soul, let him be black in front of him, and planted it from his mother's nest at one end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Sanctuary has a strong will, and Kleist screams, actually stops the momentum in the air, and turns around and shoots Killed to the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another mental slamming on Kleist, so that he can barely keep empty. Subsequently, hundreds of compound eyes on the mother's nest stared at Kleist, and a record of spirits slammed into the air, and the soul of Kleist was swayed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
