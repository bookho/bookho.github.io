If they can get the treatment of the priest in a day, most of the injuries in these ordinary warriors can be healed. However, no matter which plane, the number of priests and pastors is extremely limited. Although according to the Faro standard, the number of priests in the army is much extravagant, but not to treat ordinary soldiers, even low-level officers are impossible. All were treated before the injury had caused permanent damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms of the Brood are devastated. In the end, the feather snake survived only a few dozen, and the humanoid knight survived less than four hundred. The rest left only a few elite bats. There are still hundreds of worker bees, but unfortunately this thing can't be used to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the total number of troops in the Licha Department has fallen to less than four thousand. Fortunately, all the surrounding forces are equally badly hurt. In the Sequoia Kingdom, Richard’s current strength has jumped to the top of the nobility. Due to the long distance of the Iron Triangle Empire, there was almost no loss in this war. However, due to the deterrence of the gods and the gods, they could not openly wage war against Richard for at least one year. And a year later, Richard was a brand new Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another big loss in this battle is the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Duke of the Wolf was lying in a camp, his eyes staring at the top of the camp, and his chest slowly undulating. His face was extremely bleak, losing all the luster, abnormal gray on the skin, and several unintentional wounds on the waist. It was the part of the old man who was stabbed by the gray coat. The wound was flashing with the golden light of the gods, but there was no effect at all. All the body tissues inside had necrotic and became fibers, just like a section has completely decayed. Gray wood, no matter how strong the life energy, can't make it sprout again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the camp, Liu Sha was standing up from the Duke of the Wolf and shook his head slightly toward Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this camp, there are also the big gods of the three goddesses of Fioren, Fermi and Xiyou, but since the sand is helpless, the three of them are even less likely any idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "You should go out first, I will say a few words to the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When the people in the camp left, Richard was next to the duke, and his fingertips jumped a few lightning bolts into his body. The Duke of the Wolf became a little more excited, turned his head and looked at Richard, then slowly raised his grip on his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the right hand of the Duke of the Wolf, clasped a small and delicate seal. It is cast in green gold, with a lifelike wolf head on top, and there is a faint and undivided force flowing inside the seal, which is very similar to the smell of the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard, the Duke of the Wolf had a helpless smile and said: "It seems that my luck is not so good, this time should not be When Archimonde built the Knights into the battlefield, the gray-haired old man apparently realized that the battle was extremely dangerous and tried to get rid of the entanglement of the Duke of Glasgow and the Duke of the Wolf. After trying several unsuccessful attempts, a very horrible killing was issued, and all the soldiers in the radius of a dozen meters fell, regardless of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow was at the side of the rear, although it was also seriously injured, but finally barely escaped the terrible death. The Duke of the Wolf was not lucky, just as the front, or was directly hit by the sword of the old man in gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard wants to say that there may be a miracle, but when it comes to the mouth, it can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro’s township powerhouse has the skills and courage to not lose to anyone. At the beginning of the war, the two Dukes of the Dukes and the Duke of Glasgow, the two original enemies of life and death, greeted the gray old man side by side. However, the strength of the two sides was far apart, even if there was an endless supply of support from Russia and Russia. The two dukes could only end up with the double double wounds in exchange for some injuries from the gray-haired old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last critical moment, the gray-haired old man who had been wounded could not escape, was besieged by the knight, and still killed more than ten structures before he died. Install the knight. That is the knight who is armed by the second-order suit! More than half of them have the strength to approach the bare sanctuary. If it weren't for the two dukes who had dragged on the strongest of the other, the followers of Richard and the sacred sect of the coalition would be devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently took over the wolf prints handed over by the Duke of the Wolf, waiting for the final confession of the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf said slowly: "Richard, we... are friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course!" Richard gripped the hand of the Duke of the Wolf, and his voice was sopressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me... take care of Palin and let him follow you. It takes you four years. In addition, my territory... handed over to... Toffler, my other son. But the process may be trouble..." The Duke said intermittently, the breath of the spit is getting hotter and hotter, and every time he breathes out a hot breath, his body will be cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and said, "You can rest assured that Toffler will become the new Duke of the Wolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard has determined and has the ability to prevent the incident of Baron Fontaine from repeating itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf gave a sigh of relief, and his eyes looked out of the sky, as if to see the endless sky through the thick top of the tent, slowly said: "In order to Palin, I am actually betrayed... Faro. I don’t know if my soul after my death... can I be with the ancestors...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The last sigh of hot air spit from the mouth of the Duke of the Wolf, with the final words of the Duke, slowly dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took for Richard to stand up and get out of the camp. The wind that rushed to the surface was strong and cold, but he could not care for the thing that was blocked in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a guard and asked: "Where are the prisoners? Take me over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, in a separate camp, Richard saw Raymond. At this time, Raymond had never had the grace of being arrogant, his hair was messy, his blood was covered with mud, he was curling up on the ground, coughing desperately, splashing a little scarlet from his nose and mouth, it seemed to be heart and lungs. They all chopped up and coughed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the door coldly for a while, and the analytical ability had revealed all the conditions of Raymond’s body. This opened: "Raymond, Just because you are going to die, so you have to pull so many people together to bury you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond slowly stopped the cough, extremely difficult Hold up the upper body and then look back, revealing a weak smile. "Yes, because I am going to die, I want to do what I have to do before I die."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
