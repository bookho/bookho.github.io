			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice did not wait for Suya’s reply and went outside the conference hall Go. Suya’s reaction has long been within her expectations. If he really has a way to get twenty second-order knights, then she doesn't mind fulfilling her promise. Ellie has a clear and accurate position on her value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the main entrance of the conference hall, the blood paladin Senma is waiting there. When she saw Ellie coming out, she immediately greeted her and said, "Count Earl of Elle, Gordon, let me accompany you to pick up the knight. You can choose five second-order structures among the adults' guards. Install the knight." The guard is the elite in the elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis is really generous!" said Alize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is part of the deal." Senma answered with a blank expression. She instinctively hates Ellie, and does not hide it. The war is just around the corner, and the five second-order knights are a very important force. In addition, Ellie is still too beautiful, even more beautiful than her, this is why Senma hates her the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice walked out of the castle, and her attendant had already taken the flames with the blood of the dragon and the dragon in front of the door. She turned over and then condescended, and said to Senma, who followed closely: "Go tell Gordon, our deal is set up! But the five builders can delay the payment, wait for him to finish the battle, then give me Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma is very unexpected. Ellie did not wait for her answer. She took the guards and the attendants to go forward. Her affairs were busy day by day. There was no interest in staying in Yaning to see the army of Gordon, and directly ordered to return to their territory. went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the young female count, Senma’s eyes were softened a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, many people of the Akmon branch family left, and a small number of people stayed in the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the castle, a magnificent teleport portal is nearing completion. In a few days, it was the day when Gordon’s army set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the remaining Archimondes and Gordon is always good, at least neutral. They are to learn the construction of the plane portal, the maintenance and the knowledge of the army crossing the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most families do not have their own private planes, even if they are well-known giants in the mainland, only the most powerful blood vessels may have their own exclusive Plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight planes on the upper face of the entire Archimonde family, three of which are in the hands of Gordon and two in the hands of the Marquis of Sauron. . There is one in Goliath, and Ellie has just got a low-level plane and is building a forward base. The last plane is shared by five relatively weak branches. The remaining dozens of Archimonde branches have not yet belonged to their own planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Archimonde never lacks a career. The strength of many of the side-family families is weak, and the low-level planes with the upper limit of 18th level may be beaten, but they will never let go of the opportunity to learn the plane war. As a patriarch of Archimonde, Gordon is also willing to provide this convenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there will always be fighting between Archimonde, and as the population expands, the guys of various bastards will emerge endlessly. But the rise of the family's overall strength is still a good thing in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
