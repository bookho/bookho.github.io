			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the list and flipped through the next few pages with little pity The second-level material, shook his head helplessly, and found that he needed to carefully calculate the material in the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had already conceived a template for the knight, and he died halfway through the lack of materials. In the anticipation of the non-standard installation of 'explosion' with two standards 'initial power', plus a non-standard structure of 'vigor', the ride is inserted into the non-standard structure 'protrusion', this structure has a knight The terrible momentary attack power, the two intensified forces cooperate with the outbreak, and the attack power increased by 150%. Such a terrible direct attack is enough to instantly defeat the defense of the first-order knight. The vitality enhances the Cavaliers' ability to fight for a long time, so that after a short break, they can devote themselves to the next attack. However, the core of this solution lies in three non-standard configurations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After rethinking the range and amount of materials that can be used, Richard had to give up all non-standard builds. However, he re-listed a list of the dozens of materials needed to improve the standard construction effect, and handed it over to the female mage to purchase. He has already asked clearly that as the laboratory has allocated a sum of money, as long as the materials are purchased within the quota, there is no need to apply separately. With everything in place, Richard himself set about building the fabric with the existing materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once immersed in the world of magic, Richard temporarily forgot the troubles of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has still maintained the previous habits, starting from the material collection, Richard has decided that his first batch of knights will be made by him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of material is gradually refined into a shape, and the complicated process is like being engraved in Richard's head, there is no need to consult notes or books. The whole piece of heavy WoW leather was cut into three pieces. When the knife was used, Richard's hand was stable like a rock. After cutting the skin, the naked eye could hardly distinguish the thickness of the three pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing the magical array, Richard is more like the most sophisticated gnome alchemy machine, often running for several hours without even making the tiniest error. A line of lines flows from the tip of the magic pen, and each arc is no different from the most standard version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard begins to draw the magic array, the two assistants will involuntarily hold their breath, dare not make any sound, and will not let go of each detail. However, they never dreamed that the magical array that exists as a standard pattern in the magical code can be copied in front of the eyes without change. Is this the world of the builder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They try to remember every action, every detail, and all the steps of processing the material, even to the precise of every gesture. This is the greatest benefit of being an assistant, and you can observe the experiments of high-level wizards at close range. Now, you can learn a lot of tricks and secrets from Richard. They don't have the talent of a builder, but they can improve their ability to draw magical arrays and benefit in the future. And if you can learn some processes that only require proficiency, their future employment will be broader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you do a part, Richard will take a break. The local magical array can take anywhere from one hour to three hours, but when Richard rests, he will always see the two assistants look tireder than themselves, and learning is also a physical activity. When the energy was restored, they were still pale and unsteady. Richard, who is loaded with ‘vigor’, has a physical and energy recovery rate several times that of the two mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
