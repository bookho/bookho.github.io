			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tutub and Chuck quietly retreat, in fact there are more behind this The reason is that they have reservations in front of their subordinates. That is, according to the shooter who fled back, Richard’s team already has the strength to slay the sanctuary. With two sacred domains on each side, Richard has the ability to decide the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck’s keen sense of smell actually saved them, because there was a third sanctuary in Lord Oasis, Lord Bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next full month, the situation in the blood-stained land is more chaotic than in the past, and the most basic order and bottom line are destroyed, even Jin Hui The caravans of such giants have been looted. Soon the Jinhui battle flag pointed the finger at the red Cossack, and the two sides began to fight in every corner of the blood-stained land! Thorough chaos is not good for all parties. The traditional passage of blood-stained areas is no longer safe, and the parties lose tens of thousands of gold coins every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Richard only attacked once and annihilated a stable with only a hundred people. At other times, Richard was immersed in the preparations for returning to Noland's plane portal and preparing to bring back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the month, a mysterious team came to the blue water oasis and went directly to the territory of Richard. In the center of the territory, Richard had drawn an area where the slaves dug the foundation. After more than half a month, a peculiar stone tower was built in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the time lighthouse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time lighthouse is the one in the base of the Archimonde family. Disassembling it and transporting it to the blood-stained place is the hen's nest and the humanoid primary warriors it created. After more than a month, the number of humanoid junior fighters has exceeded 100, and an additional dozen of throwing soldiers and wind teeth have been added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard went to the blood-stained land, Baron Fossa finally breathed a sigh of relief. He sent only a few dozen people to station in the forward base. The baron, who was almost disabled by Richard, did not send more troops. This point is negligible for the mother's nest, and the junior soldiers and the throwing soldiers easily smashed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then in the process of dismantling the lighthouse, the high intelligence and wide-ranging advantages of the humanoid junior fighters were fully utilized. Their intelligence has been close to the more awkward normal humans, and the two elite fighters have reached a level of intelligence. Hundreds of warriors worked together and quickly removed the time lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Lighthouse is made of many rare materials, and the cost of creating a new one is too great. Fortunately, the people in the Faro plane did not know the role of the time lighthouse, at least the Baron Fossa did not know. He is not interested in such a stone tower that is completely inconsistent with his own aesthetics. So it was cheaper for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still a little commotion in the blue water oasis, and Richard’s old friends have come to ask about the circle. The shape of this stone tower is like a mage. Tower, although the tower is too small compared to the Master Tower, which integrates life, research, defense, and attack, it does not seem to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard is a magician. It is not a good thing to have a Master Tower in the city, even on the edge. This means that most of the city's control will fall into the hands of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took some effort to explain, and seems to inadvertently reveal that this strange guy is actually used to pray, can pass the faith more clearly, he did not Explain whether the belief is ancestor or something else. But this is enough to appease others. The magicians of Amman and Tiffman have also been there during the construction. According to their analysis, the patterns of the tower should be some unknown language, not a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, and if the height of the stone tower is used as a common watchtower and arrow tower, it does not threaten the territory of other people, and this matter is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time lighthouse was built, and Richard also built the plane transfer door. According to calculations, this portal can only return three people to Noland. Three people have already consumed more than three hundred magic crystals from Richard. For a while, Richard is unable to get more magic crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This late night, Liu Sha took the book of Time and boarded the top of the Time Lighthouse. After the curse of the curse, a golden light was shot in the book of Time, and then a dark, dark golden flame was burned in the combustion chamber at the top of the lighthouse. In the flame, various indistinguishable pictures will pop up from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Lighthouse, finally ignited again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a new two-storey ancillary building under the time lighthouse, and Richard’s transmission magic array is located here. In addition, the outbuildings are also heavily stationed to defend the magical array and the vast amount of magic material stored there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, a large-scale magic array has been laid out. This is a standard plane transfer array, the difference is the outer circle of singular patterns. These lines are contained in the coordinates of Noland's coordinates. The main function is to embed the Faro plane information into the plane channel, which can effectively isolate the perception of the local gods of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction of the fluctuations in the time lighthouse, Richard took a deep breath and knelt down and placed his hand on a magic crystal. Under the guidance of his own magic, the magic crystal slowly lights up, and the pure magic turns into a blazing light flow, which flows along the lines of the law, and begins to illuminate the magic crystals along the way. After a while, all the magic crystals spewed a huge amount of magic power at the same time, slamming in the middle, a portal slowly formed in the center of the magic array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this transmission of the array, it was Noland. According to the flow sand, the destination will be the eternal dragon temple of Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the portal, Richard was thrilled. I don't know how the people of Noland have been. However, he turned to think, because the reason for the gracefulness of the grace, now Noland time is less than a month. Even with the time drifting in the turbulent time and space, Noland's time will never exceed two months. What can happen in two months? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand into the hall, seeing the glorious portal, stunned, but inadvertently revealed a sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sand sand! We can go back!" Richard was very excited and his voice became very loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsla smiled a little reluctantly and said, "Yes, you can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard looked at the sand with some doubts and said, "What's wrong with you? Don't you feel happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of sand snorted and instantly returned to normal, with Pushed Richard a little and said: "I am just a distressed offering and these magic crystals! The lighthouse of the time is somewhat damaged, so three hundred magic crystals are only enough for the two of us to go back and forth once, there is no way to bring one more person. You'd better expect your build and the goods to earn these costs back, otherwise you won't have money back next time. Also, don't blame me for not reminding you that upgrading the plane channel is a huge expense." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement of Richard was actually poured out half-extinguished. Among the huge risks of the plane war, the huge cost of constructing and maintaining the plane channel is one of the most important factors. For example, this temporary portal, in order not to be discovered by the Faro plane gods, the consumption is further enhanced, it takes 150 hundred magic crystals to support a person's round-trip transmission. If you calculate the price of Noland, this is 75,000 gold coins! So this time he returned to the end and only went back with the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
