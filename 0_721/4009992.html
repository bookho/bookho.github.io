			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite bats squat over the target, staring at their every move. This is a large caravan consisting of fifty vans, followed by twenty troop carriers. The main escort of the team is nearly four hundred cavalry. On the roof of the truck, the archer holding the bow is still standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is close to the human kingdom, the caravan guards seem relaxed and talk to each other. With the outstanding hearing of elite bats, Richard vaguely identified the guards who were discussing how much dividends they could get after the mission was completed. As can be seen from their speeches, this adventure is extremely rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stopped the horse and said, "Gunde, let the troops stop. We have something to do."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole army stopped!" Gangde shouted, then took the tomahawk from his back and said, "Head! Who is going to cut this time?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Cossack, our old friend!" said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the Gangde, the splash, the ogre, and the soldiers who had participated in the battle of blood-stained eyes lit up. They have a lot of red Cossack's blood in their hands, and many people who know each other die in the hands of the red Cossack. Now Li Chabing is strong and strong, and the strength of the followers has been enhanced. When he meets the red Cossack, he is naturally murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, they are still thirty kilometers away!" Looking at the murderous followers, Richard could not help but shook his head. He took out the map and looked at it, and he chose the marching route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops then set off and took a rest after arriving at the designated location before the team set off. The red Cossack caravan stopped at three kilometers and had just prepared lunch. They walked for an hour more than Richard, and they had no rest and no meals. Therefore, when the battle is really going on, the soldier’s physical strength will be consumed faster. This is a small detail, but in the second half of the battle, the physical gap will turn into an irreversible advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s troops were two kilometers from the camp of the Red Cossacks, they were discovered by the sentinels. The caravan's temporary camp had a little commotion, and it calmed down. What should everyone do or not do. Only the knights were on the scene and clenched their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this scene, Richard said faintly: "It seems that they have a strong foothold!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you win?" In her feelings, this caravan is a bit large, and it would be difficult to eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already calculated the balance of power between the two sides, just saying: "Most of your hard work after the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I have three pastors now, do you want us to work hard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three guys are together without you Half useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red Cossacks separated a team of cavalry, rushed over to Richard, and then strangled the horses a dozen meters away. For the first thick knight, he shouted: "Who are you? Here is the red Cossack caravan camp! You can't get closer, now you are your identity, immediately! Otherwise, you will be at your own risk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real threat. In the bloody land, the role between the caravan and the horse is often changed, especially the bloody and brutal red Cossack. When their caravans meet other caravans, as long as they are profitable, they often make a temporary guest appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the pioneer of the Sequoia Kingdom, Richard Richard, Richard Akmond." Richard said safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pioneering knight!" The red Cossack's knight opened his mouth and laughed, then said evilly: "We don't have much to do with the Red Cossack and Sequoia Kingdom." So don't scare us with the nobility title of that place! We are in a good mood these days, so I advise you to leave, hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said: "Exactly, my mood is also good. Now, I am collecting the transit fee in the name of the Sequoia Kingdom to develop the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, Transit fee?” The Red Cossack Knight could hardly believe his ears and roared: “This is a place for bloodstaining! Going to pay from here? Checking where to stand?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Checkpoint? Gangde, go and insert my flag." Then, pointed to the flag inserted on the red earth, said: "This is the checkpoint."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red Cossack knight has laughed out in anger and then asks: "Then you What charges? "This trade is very rich harvest, appeared to reach the destination, there is no additional interest in the war. If not, with his usual temper, when he heard the word transit fee, he greeted his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is very serious in explaining: "The land where I was infected with blood is the scope of my pioneering territory. In my territory, who do I want to collect? For the transit fee, you can collect the transit fee and how much you want to collect. Now, your transit fee is tentatively set at 100 yuan for each truck. Go back and prepare the money. In addition, I have to check the goods on the bus. If you have extra valuable items, you will need to add extra money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious attitude and content of Richard is completely rigorous and absurd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red Cossack’s knight’s face swelled red for a moment, and his thoughts were blank, and he didn’t know what to say. He gasped a few mouthfuls and said: "I want to pass the transit fee? I don't have a gold coin, only a bad one! If you want to receive it, come over and take it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Richard to nod and said: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t seen any representation by Richard, behind him six Ten throwing soldiers suddenly struggled to throw a throwing axe! At a distance of more than ten meters, the power of the flying axe is incredible, and the flying axe of the throwing soldier is not thrown indiscriminately. Every four throwing soldiers will deal with a knight, and will never cross the mistake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sky, the red Cossack knights felt that there was a huge shadow under the hood, and the fear of death made the action stiff and the breathing stopped! In the roaring axe, the whistle of the four-handed axe was particularly fierce, and the four elite throwing soldiers all aimed at the knight who talked with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of axe, Richard’s vision suddenly widened, and there was no longer a line of sight in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He killed Captain Johnny!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
