			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face suddenly said: "If you really want to help Richard, it is not like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah, what do I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When necessary, seek the help of the Great Snow Mountain Temple. Richard is now equivalent to fighting alone, fundamentally I won't get a rest. If he goes on like this, he will die sooner or later. Although I helped him establish a point system, it is not a mandatory constraint force. Once the battle is worse, no more points will let the strong ones come. Faro's, after all, points must have a life, it will make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, no face smiles, said: "So, when strong When the casualty reaches a certain percentage, you will suddenly discover that all of our friends have disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going back to the temple now?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am just a reminder. I have a feeling that maybe we will soon encounter a crisis that is difficult to deal with. At the time, perhaps all the power that can be used cannot be let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will it be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; No face also floated helpless smile, said: "I don't know. Fate is the only force I can't control. If I can see the fate, there is no need to wear a mask."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are silent, and the messenger continues to fly forward in silence, as if to fly to the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a full six bottles of Essence, Richard walked into the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed a bottle of embers on the altar and watched them become the power of time to join the torrent of time on the dome. No accident, the will of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are summoning me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I am currently working with the Reaper The war, but the loss is heavy. I hope to get more help and help me to resist the help of the Reaper," Richard said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reaper comes from my light, they are not affected by me. On the contrary, they have been trying to erode my field. So you should know that I can't give you too much help."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is a little bit." Richard has been pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you for?" asked the old dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like chatting between friends, Richard is silent, then says: "For a few people, but also for many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Dragon commented: "A disappointing answer. You have my title, there is a vast world in front of you. You should not consider it for others, but everyone else. You should rely on you as the core. Your strength is their hope. But now, you have to fight the reaper for a full-scale war, and there is no hope of winning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There will always be miracles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not a miracle that can occur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The words of eternal and timeless dragons suddenly lost their emotions and became cold and indifferent: "As the owner of the second title, you do have the right to ask for special grace. But this right It can only be used once a year. Now, this is your special grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One The ball of light floated in front of Richard. Richard reached out and touched the ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gives omniscience: Ember essence (advanced). <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and held the ball of light, the equivalent of five top sacrifices, the influx of time, which unblocked the knowledge inside the ball. This knowledge is very much and long. Most of them are about the characteristics of the ember essence, and the method of making the activated ember essence is added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this explanation, Richard suddenly shines! However, after reading on, he immediately let the light in his eyes go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of making activated embers is simple. As long as the essence of the embers is eroded by the torrent of time, after a long period of time, it will take enough time to regain its activity. This is the origin of the essence of the revitalized embers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard couldn’t help but scream. Not to mention that no one can find the exact location of the torrent of time, who is the one who dares to jump in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush of the power of time is extremely horrible, even if the super strong can not withstand the power of the moments of thousands of years, the power will be annihilated in an instant . Unless it is a superpower who has mastered the rules of time and space, it is possible to survive in the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the history of Noland, there has not been a superpower who has mastered both time and space rules. From another angle, can a person who has mastered the power of time and space be called a super strong person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the method of making the essence of the embers is to know that it is useless. Instead, let Richard be convinced that this extremely rare material can only be obtained from the Dragon of Eternity and Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a piece of useless information, there are also five sacrifices? Richard does not think that one day he will be able to move in and out of the flood of time. Even if he has that kind of skill, he must find out where the flood of time is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s heart suddenly flashed, and he hurriedly turned the information over to the head and looked at it carefully. One of the small, inconspicuous words finally caught the attention of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This text explains how Essence Essence does not know how it appears in the world of order, but some features are already identifiable. One of them is that the essence of embers cannot be created and cannot be proliferated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly thought of the meaning, which means that when the reapers appeared in the order world, the embers they carried were limited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that when the harvesters collect flesh and blood and various resources, they also try to recover the wreckage. So far, perhaps Richard’s most serious blow to them is to collect a large amount of embers and sacrifice them to the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sudden, Richard saw a glimmer of light in the night. As long as the reaper is continuously destroyed and the essence of the embers is collected, one day, one day, the reaper can no longer create a new unit. At that time, it is the time to completely drive the reaper out of Faro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon has left, deducting the special grace of God's omniscience, and Richard has the grace of nearly twenty top sacrifices. The next list is a very standard list of gods, there is nothing in it, but there is nothing special about it. Richard quickly chose a pile of materials, an artifact and several legendary equipment, and left the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t wait to fly back to Faro right away, because on the big battlefields, there are still a lot of reaper wrecks that have not had time to collect and refine! Now Richard knows that if they let go of these wrecks, they will soon become new recruiters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Solomon Castle in the Netherstorm, a new meeting is taking place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, after the castle master and the universityman Rodi sat down, other seats appeared one after another. But this meeting is a bit special because there are three seats that are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several couples with the conference staff did not know the situation and saw that they suddenly lost three seats. They could not help but move their bodies and whisper each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the castle master coughed and said slowly: "The distinguished scholars, as you can see, our recent losses are very There are two former companions who have already decided to leave us. The soulwalker Jin Fala still has no success, but the good news is that, at least until now, his soul resonance crystal is still intact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the castle’s palm hand waved and an image appeared in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark hall with several irregular huge crystals in the hall. On one of the crystals, a paragraph is appearing, that is the name of Jin Fala. However, at this moment, a faint wave of volatility passed through a lot of space and suddenly hit one of the crystals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless dense cracks on the soul resonance crystal, and then slamming open! In the fragments of the four fragments, each piece has a picture of the hen's nest flashing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the explosion, the brand name of Jin Fala fell from the table to the ground, rolled a few times, then paused under the gaze of the crowd and fell to the ground. . At this time, a piece of crystal debris fell and squatted on the nameplate, causing it to turn over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dead in the conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the castle master said: "The foreword is recovered, it seems that the University of Kinfala has failed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to use the nest, is it not the 12th order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodi University said: "A tenth level awakens The mother's nest of the real name is not an ordinary mother's nest. What's more, it also acquires an independent and complete soul through our soul-filling plan. What kind of changes will happen during this time, there is no precedent for reference, so There is no inference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have two members who are related to the mother's nest, maybe we need to take this mother nest seriously."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fierce parliamentarian has different opinions: "How to treat it? On the contrary, I think we need to re-examine all the past steps of action and erase all fate. Traces of the connection. Otherwise, once the mother nest grows up and breaks through the shackles of the plane, it will be ours. Difficult. Are you willing to face a mother who is as high as this level in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Representatives is arguing, but there is obviously disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle master coughed and said, "Maybe we don't have to worry so much. The reaper is already in Faro, and the destruction of Faro is inevitable. And that Only the mother's nest can't be separated from Faro. After the destruction of the plane, even if it can survive, it will also sleep on a broken land, waiting for the next chance to wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man who seems to be dying at any time suddenly said: "In this case, the mother's nest will inevitably degenerate into a seed form to survive. If we find this seed.. ...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the words came out, even the university student Rodi’s breathing was a little more urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of nest that has proven itself powerful and horrible! Nothing is more attractive than this, especially after controlling the body of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scholars are deeply aware of how terrible a fully grown mother nest is. Perhaps after a hundred years, they can conquer the entire Noland and lead humans and other races to explore the deepest secrets of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
