Why not! Those damn lazy dragons have been robbed by me, and they will run when they can't see me before, but I don't appear. At that time, I will still go out to collect treasures. But recently I was wrong. I was led by an old dragon. They didn’t run away, and they didn’t collect treasures. Every time I used to, I saw an empty dragon nest and a head. Helpless and weakly look at my dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, the legendary mage’s expression became stunned, and she gnashed her teeth and said, “You can Imagine what a weak look of a dragon is? Do they really think that I won’t kill the dragon?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You didn’t kill them?” Gordon asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Nothing at all!" Su Hailun grinds a small white tooth and says, "Because the old dragon knows me well, it has been me." I have been robbed for thirteen times. So it tells all the dragons, as long as they don’t resist, I won’t kill them, I will play at most one out. And I have enough dragon materials in my hand, basically impossible. Use it, don't need to add it for the time being. This old thing!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you made this dragon country..." think. He slammed his beard on his chin and suddenly felt that he had pulled out several beards because of his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s voice has risen a full eight degrees: “Yes! The lazy dragons, since they don’t want to dig treasures, come and work for me. Fighting is good! There is no dragon in the world that can eat and sleep every day, at least not within the scope of my sight! When my dragon country is well made, I will put them all in, let These lazy bones know that there is still a great legendary life in the world, called the boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes become a line, speed Further slowing down: "Is it true that the dragons placed in the Dragon Kingdom can also be summoned by you in battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helun as if there is no feeling at all To the temptations and sinister intentions of Gordon, it is especially rejoicing, as if to show off his new toy: "That is of course! When the dragon country is fully built, I can summon a lot of dragons at once. At that time my The enemy must not think that there will be real dragons in the magic dragons. It is estimated that they will all die after they die. Strange, why my summoning dragon can fight on the battlefield for so long, huh, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes jumped, quietly Say: "His Royal Highness, your legendary magic should be called 'Dragon Call". This should be your biggest secret..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter! Let You know nothing, just let other people know that there is nothing! Anyway, I am a lot of people, can you use hidden power?" Su Hailun eyes as bright as the morning star, staring at Gotton intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon has no choice but to smile. The legendary Master’s tactics are not surprising. It can even be said that the customs are at the extreme, but the people are the dragons. What can you do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another legend of the legendary Master is that when the enemy can despise the enemy at the strategic level, he can also despise the enemy at the tactical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, Your Highness..." Gotton still refused to admit defeat, so he tried to find some weaknesses for the legendary mage: "The dragon country is indeed powerful, but it It cost a lot to build..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a word is not finished, Gordon himself feels that he is not strong enough. The word costly is not applicable to Su Hailun. There is an energy-absorbing forest in which the mother-in-law dances. It is only a matter of time, not a cost issue, to build a dragon country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, maintaining the Dragon Kingdom also requires a lot of supplies, but the dragons can eat very well." Gordon immediately changed his angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also true!" Su Hailun actually agreed, after nodded hard, he used a small claw to slap on Gotton’s back and almost took it. The strong man stumbled and said, "It doesn't matter, the food of the dragon is your responsibility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Why is it me?" Gordon growled. This kind of thing is not the first time it has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked hard all over the place, cultivating a group of elite and brave warriors, as well as strong followers of bloodthirsty, mastered in a short time. Several planes, and the discussion of a secondary plane is nearing completion. In any one of the giants, even looking at the entire continent, this is worth a book of immortal feats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the only thing that makes Gotton regret is that, despite this, he is still not wealthy, and even he has to worry about the replenishment of each war. Most of the wealth was transferred from his hand to the pocket of the legendary mage, and in a way he never figured out. Although it has not affected the interests of the followers to be loyal enough, his own private library is almost inferior, and his status is seriously disproportionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage often sponsors Gordon, all strategic and munitions are supplied at an affordable price, and even at some important moments, some priceless treasures will be delivered. For example, the heart of the demon lord who gave it to Gordon during the sacrifice ceremony was not able to be measured by the power of money. Any of the three empires will be willing to come up with a duke to exchange for this heart. Because this sacrifice can be exchanged for three hundred to five hundred years if it is simply used to exchange time and grace. The world's emperor, the most wanted is eternal life. However, the huge wealth created by Gordon is still flowing to Su Hailun. Still lost. I just know that according to a contract of the year, my debt is still expanding, and this trend has not been curbed. Now, just paying interest every year, letting Gotton feel breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Su Helun counted the daily expenses of the dragon to Gotton’s head. The Archimonean patriarch, despite his intention to resist, knew the final result. It must be in vain. In small things, the legendary mage never plays the shackles of uncertainty. So in the end, Su Hailun simply explained some things, so that Gordon understood that her calculations had no problems, and that Gotton understood it incorrectly. If you want to pay off this year's interest, Gordon will not only have to eat dozens of dragons, but also be responsible for eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s face is already full of black air, but fortunately his men can’t see this. At that time, dozens of people finally got rid of the state of dizziness, and they all climbed up. After overweight, they will not cause any trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people have nothing to do, only the Dragon Master Lina is not in a good condition, she is still sitting on the ground, caressing her towering chest, screaming in disgust Peer. The unfortunate female mage was crushed at the bottom, not only the big man of the violent boxing warrior Wald, but also the steel embryo of Capita. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who stood up knew that this was the half-face of the legendary mage, so they looked around curiously. Can you see the legendary half-plane, or Su Hailun's half-face, this opportunity is extremely rare. But looking into the distance, you can only see a circle of erected magic light curtains surrounding them, and you can't see the scene behind the light curtain at all. The magic light curtain is as high as tens of meters. If you look up, you can only see a circle of dark voids, and occasionally a few gorgeous colors pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
