			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic chariot, sitting in a 30-year-old mage . He wore a gorgeous and powerful mage robe, wearing three rings on his long white fingers, and the ring was inlaid with incredible gemstones. Judging from the magical fluctuations that are constantly emanating, these three rings are undoubtedly fine. He is handsome and looks like a manicured short beard, and his body is full of self-confidence and calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compartment is very large, in addition to the bed and desk, two cabinets, you can also sit down two young and beautiful female mage. Although their magic level is not very strong, the use is obviously not in the battle, but as an assistant to the middle-aged mage. It is necessary to assist the middle-aged mage to sort out the complicated intelligence and official documents, and to help the owner relax the tight nerves through his young and beautiful body and superb skills when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge map on the wall, which is a detailed picture of a blood-stained land, rich in content, all that Richard has seen. The map of the blood-stained land is added together, and it must be ten times more. The map not only shows the various settlements, oases, rivers, but also the general distribution of various forces, as well as the activity zone of the slave-slaughter team. The specialties of the blood-stained land, slaves, agricultural products and ores are all detailed on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a map can be said to be worthwhile. It is the red Cossack that has been filled with countless gold coins and life for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the carriage door was ringed, and with the permission of the Master, a capable warrior opened the door and handed the latest information to two beautiful The young female mage will be transferred to the middle-aged mage after they have been unpacked and tested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information was very long, and he wrote three pages of paper in a dense manner. The Master only wiped it out in less than half a minute, and seized the key point: Lee’s cavalry was hit hard, losing 112 rides, killing the enemy thirty, and cutting nearly a hundred... Well, this Sally didn’t tell the truth, the number of killings must be at least halved.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage stood up from the desk, came to the map, thought about it, used the magic pen to outline the battlefield on the map, and then filled in the numbers. Then stood in front of the map and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quiet in the cabin, and the two young women are holding their breaths subconsciously, not afraid to disturb the mage's thinking. They are very clear that in front of this distinguished great magician, Salenwell, the most hated to be disturbed when thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Faro plane, the definition of the big magister is sixteen, and sometimes fifteen. With the release of powerful eight-level magic, the combat power has a qualitative leap and upgrade. Correspondingly, the honorable name of the great magician will be given to the eleventh level magician. There are many group injury spells in the sixth-order magic, which makes the magicians have the power in the small-scale battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the battle reaches a thousand people, a six-level magic does not say that it has no effect, but at least it cannot reverse the situation. However, this still does not hinder the noble status of the magicians. Because the role of the magician is not only reflected in the beauty-free aspect of killing, but also in the production of higher magic items. And a great magician who has lived for a long time can't be underestimated. They may not have strong combat power. The long years can make them have enough magic scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Noland, the cannon bench with a large number of reels is the most powerful fire point in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
