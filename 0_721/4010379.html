This marching array fully demonstrates the stability and patience of the host. He does not mind the days of barbarians for a few days or even weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian tribes around have gathered the most powerful warriors and have been chasing after Anrekara for ten days. The extremely complex terrain caught up with his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, the barbarian was attacked by Anrekara here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are several white eagle flying in the sky. This huge raptor is the unique product of the ancestral highlands, which can be seen almost everywhere. To their figure, but the white eagle hovering on the battlefield at the moment is not a natural product, but a creation of the mother's nest. In the higher sky, it is suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this battle, the barbarians who had been slightly inferior were defeated, and more than 3,000 soldiers eventually escaped only a few hundred people. The barbarian forces were swept away, and then Anrekara marched straight and broke through the most powerful barbarian tribe in the region. In the temple of the highest peak of the tribe, it found an unprecedented Idol: the ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the brains are holding the gods and altars and flying to distant turbulent places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anrekara continues to encircle the barbarian tribes in the ancestral highlands and keeps the captives to the rear. These strong barbarians will be auctioned later. The chambers of commerce from various human kingdoms became slaves. The barbarians were the most popular and one of the most valuable slaves. The source of the most barbaric slaves in the western human kingdom of the mainland was the blood-stained land. The source of the dwarf slaves was also In the land of blood, the slave is the blood of the Faro economy, and Richard is equal to a large artery that has pinched the human kingdom in the western part of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all followers are going around, and Sands and two heavenly guards stay in Oasis, offering sacrifices and religious affairs compared to siege Grazing land is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Oasis City, the drifting sands have undergone a renovation, which looks a bit more gorgeous, but rebuilt twice and introduces many human over-elegant styles. Compared with other buildings in the city, it is at best a medium-sized three-story building. The building also includes an altar and a library. The place where the sand can live can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sand does not care, and Nye is not concerned. The priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall never value luxury. The altar of the true Eternal and Time Dragon is an unrepairable ruin, so in their eyes, only the time test can be withstood. The thing is the real luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only if Iopo is dissatisfied, he will always talk to himself and feel that the glory of eternal and timeless dragons is like being compared by the three goddesses. In fact, everyone understands what he is thinking, nothing more than the grandeur of the three goddesses, and the temple of the eternal and timeless dragon, except for the followers of Richard, no one can sneak without permission from the sand, so almost no Just fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of a priest depends on God, not on the level of the gods, so in the eyes of the world, the status of the goddess of the three goddesses is much higher than that of Iraq. Even if Iowa is a 16th-level priest, it is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sand is sitting in the living room, staring at a box of magic in front of him, and Nei and Io sit on the left and right. I was also trying to look at the magic box, and I was thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the appointed time, Richard did not return, just sent someone to send such a magic box, and a letter to the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is silent, and after a long time, the box is opened, but there is no rush to see the letter inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This open magic box transmits a rainbow-like glow, obviously space equipment, and a small and quaint statue in the magic box. There is also an ore that is not too small in size. In addition, there are two bones with gray ash and seven or eight shining shadow drills in the flat layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening the magic box, Iowa immediately held his breath, and even the two sisters of Naiyou became gray for a moment, they were all there. In an instant, I smelled the atmosphere of the sacrifice, and it was two top sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the two bones are also low-level sacrifices, although the shadow drill can not be used for sacrifice, it is also valuable, it is a high-grade weapon and space. The best materials for the equipment, but these are not as big as the impact of the two top sacrifices. For them, the top sacrifice means strong, meaning that the upper limit of the level means the only meaning of life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io's eyes are almost inseparable from the two top sacrifices, the throat is constantly rolling up and down, and Naiyou seems to be much calmer. She quickly returned her eyes to black and white, but it was only a black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still young, it is the age of the unparalleled, the magnificent color is hard to describe, with the growing ability of the gods, the show is A beauty that never seems to fade, and that can last forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a sigh, but there are vicissitudes of the years. If it is not true that she knows her age, Io and Naiyou almost think that the sand has been alive. After a long period of time, just like Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oracles of the Eternal Dragon Temple are not affected by the time, but their hearts are different, and they spend a long time alone in their exclusive temple. Time will always be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sand is really less than twenty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand took the letter and hesitated for a long time, but shook his head, did not open it, and put it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel and Naiyu face each other, they are the guardians of the sands, and their relationship is closer than the confidant, so they are very clear about the sand, but they The way to comfort is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s inner pain struggle, repeated wars, decided to give up the obvious and growing tree of Richard, standing on the side of the sand, for already thinking As for the upgraded madman, the two sacrifices are just as dazzling as the midday sun, and it is easy to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, Richard has gotten more sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pain to want to give up such a big tree, and Richard’s old grievances, in front of the top sacrifices, can be ignored Except, Io is forced to forget all of this, and then stand on the side of the sand, so he feels very great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this magic box and this letter have been sent for a while, until today, the sand is only opened, in fact, the contents of the letter can be guessed without looking It is nothing more than that Richard has a more important thing to do before he goes to the absolute battlefield, and the more important thing in Richard’s position today, the greater the risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with regard to the whereabouts of Richard, the followers of Faro knew on the day of the arrival of the messenger, after all, this is all public news, but Only a handful of smart people vaguely guess what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io believes that he should express his position, so he cleared his throat and said: "The sand-smashing adults, Richard is too much. I don’t even come to see you. I ran to the battlefield alone. Where is the domain battlefield, he is not even a big magician, this is really irresponsible if you can’t come back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fighting sergeant was so passionate, but when he spoke, he found that the gaze of the sand was getting more and more confused, so he quickly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand sighed again and whispered, "Yeah, he went to Carando last time, and this time he went to the field." He, he...hey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, Richard does not know to come back and tell you individually." The fighting priest is eager to make up for the mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie You really can’t stand it anymore, swearing: “It’s not like this, I’m a big man, although I’m not sure why Richard’s adult is going to go to this place at this time. The battlefield, but I believe that Richard’s adult must have a reason to go. He must be very clear about what kind of place the absolute field battlefield is, and he has personally visited more than one absolute field battlefield, then since he goes again, there is Certainly, Richard is a responsible man and will not make fun of his own life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sacred vaguely feels bad, argues "Who dares to say that he will be able to come back from the field of battlefields."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Naiyou nodded and admitted that this is a rare attitude to fight The priest is even more uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sentence of Naiyou not only let the fighting gods squat, but also let the sands smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said this: "So, if he comes to say goodbye to you, he will be afraid that he will never be determined to go to the battlefield."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the quicksand have regained their brilliance and said to themselves: "Really, maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Naiyu refers to the box of the magic box, saying: "Not maybe, it is true, these are the souvenirs left by Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah." The sand whispered, such a valuable souvenir can indeed represent Richard's thoughts on her. She is very aware of Richard's overhead income. The thing in this box is the most precious thing in the hands of Richard. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah." The fighting sergeant exclaimed, and looked at Neiyou in disbelief, but Neiyun did not care for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain sand picked up the letter, thought about it, put it back into the mezzanine on the magic box, then closed the lid and picked up the seal The magic box, put it on your own bookshelf, and then take a closer look, the amber eyebrows slowly stretched out, the lips are slightly tilted, and the expression is more and more satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she brows and slams the two guards of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking down the stairs, when I was out of the gate, Io finally couldn’t help but stop Nai, and asked: "Why are you saying that it is a souvenir." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible, that is, Richard left to the quicksand I still owe it to God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what do you want, I want to take up the grace of the slain adult to return the debt." Nai faintly asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Finally, two million words, two million words without breaking, if you put it in the book "Sin City", I am afraid no one I will believe that even I will not believe it. Looking back now, it seems to be a miracle, but it is accumulated bit by bit. There is persistence, concentration, and possible accidents. Prejudging and preparing, but in retrospect, persistence and concentration are the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously doing one thing, for a long time, there will be unexpected results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About updating this thing, there is a saying that everyone is familiar with it, that is, to solve problems in development, and in the constant update, you will find many yourself. Problems that have not been thought of before, will make mistakes that will be made sooner or later, and will be consciously corrected and improved, and the text will be advertised, gorgeous, accurate and dull in this process, and then re-powered and The process of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
