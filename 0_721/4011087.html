			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the selection is completed, all the power of time is turned into a light band, returning to the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is to make Richard look awkward, even if it is a first-class grace, the sacrifice of the complete devil lord should be enough. But in addition, there are a total of fifty top-level sacrifices, but that is at least equivalent to four second-level gods, how have they all disappeared? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the will of the eternal and timeless dragon has left, watching the empty altar of time, Richard has to accept this reality. The eternal and the dragon of time has always been fair. There is only one explanation for this situation. That is, the core of perpetual motion is not an ordinary first-class grace. It should be a kind of very rare first-class grace, and it will be taken away by the old dragon. Ten top sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of him, there is a silver metal box inside, inside is the permanent core. Richard opened the metal box and looked at the permanent core inside. It is hard to believe that this diameter is only one meter. The three-meter-long barrel machine has the energy to push the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacrifice is over, but Richard did not get the answer. He was not discouraged and turned and walked outwards. At this time, two moments of light flew from the void and merged into Richard's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray brings two messages to Richard, one is that he sacrificed a first-class sacrifice, the grace of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. The predetermined amount has been reached, so the vestige he has has increased. In addition, the title of Richard has also been upgraded accordingly, and he has won the final title of Time Lord. Along with this title, there is a small rule about time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule is only the most obvious part, and it is incomplete, but the time rule is one of the lowest rules that constitute the world, until Richard falls into the dark area. At that time, it really began to analyze the comprehension time rules. So this rule is a considerable step forward for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the Eternal Dragon Hall, a transfer, and returned to the floating island of Archimonde. When he set foot on the ground of the floating island, Richard suddenly felt that a lot of energy in the void suddenly converge, and he couldn't help but look up and look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there are large colored bands of light in the sky of the floating world, and the rainbow in July is constantly shining, and then seven beams of different colors fall, shining in Archimonde On the floating island. The pale golden road under the foot of Richard suddenly trembled, then slowly moved, and even broke away from the original track, and went up to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly remembered that his authority in ukiyo-d had improved, which originally meant this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the floating island is, the more it eventually goes directly over the floating island on the second floor, and finally enters the first track! Now is not only the floating world, but also all the floating islands, and even the temple is at the foot of Archimonde! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating island itself is constantly growing, and the temple at the highest point has begun to expand accordingly, and finally becomes a grand palace, no smaller than the size of the eternal dragon temple. . Li looked different, his body flashed and he had already entered the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the third level, this temple is the control center of the entire floating island. When it reaches the first floor, the exterior and interior of the temple become more magnificent. complicated. This is the only self-contained building on the floating island, and all control functions should be concentrated here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that the Eternal and Time Dragon said that the floating islands of three or more floors have some of the authority of the floating world. Now his floating island has moved to the first floor, on all floating islands. At this time, he wants to know what special privileges he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the temple has changed. The center is an altar, the style is exactly the same as the time altar of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high platform at the end of the temple. The center is a square stone pillar with a huge crystal embedded in the top of the stone pillar. There are three small stone pillars on each side of the high platform, and a scroll is floating on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first looked at the small stone pillars around the high platform. As expected, these were special territories, but the number has increased to six, and the scope of the territory has also expanded. One thousand kilometers. In such a territorial scope, a large kingdom can be established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard went to the center of the stone pillar, hesitated, and slowly placed his hand on the central crystal. Intuition reappears, waiting for him will be an incredible, earth-shaking miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard suddenly held his breath! His consciousness has connected the crystal, and there is a sweet but some mechanical sound in the crystal: "Do you start the vagrant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Chadu suspecting his own ears and launching Faust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subconsciously, Richard heard his voice answering: "Start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal flashed a few times, and the sweet voice sounded again: "Energy shortage, Can't start. Please fix or add energy core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that he got the core of perpetual motion when he sacrificed, and he felt uncomfortable in his heart. . Did the old dragon know that this would be the case, so I intentionally gave the core of the permanent movement to myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to add energy?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of information in the crystal, and after reading it, he vomited heavily and finally confirmed that the core of the permanent movement he had when he sacrificed Yufude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard has experienced many planes, he has also been to the abyss of the Abyss and the dark regions. But the information revealed in the information still shocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true form of Fu Shide is not a city, but a floating fortress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its origins have been drowned in the long history, and it was already here before Nolande humans appeared. Even the eternal and timeless dragons lack information in this regard, and cannot provide information on who built uvulade and why it appears here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an unprecedented floating fortress, FS has many powerful functions, but the only one that attracts the most is that shifu can suppress the plane. the rule of! Even in the high planes of the abyss, Faustian can suppress the plane rules within a few hundred kilometers, thus making the abyss a normal environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this ability, Richard immediately thought of the Abyss abyss and thought of the man who was integrated with the entire abyss. If he uses the power of Faustian to suppress the power of Abyss, then Richard and he will at least stand on an equal footing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately decided to start Faust in the right time, driving this floating city into the abyss, and then at the end of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With floating world, it does not mean that it will succeed. The man is terrible, and the rules of the abyss are in control. It is not too much to say that he is the son of Abyss. Such a man, even if the power of the abyss was suppressed, Richard did not overcome his grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is still in the abyss of Abis, then this man has no weakness at all, strength, speed, tyrannical equipment, and can use the power of the rules at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the power of the abyss is suppressed, Richard is just not losing. Perhaps the only place he can find a little advantage is to know magic and possibly be more proficient in combat techniques. But this little advantage is not enough to win, because Richard has obvious disadvantages in the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha made people call no face, and then handed a light group to her, and there was a miniature image of Faust in the light group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? It seems to be awesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a smile "This is the floating island, and... the entire control of the floating world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face whistling, saying: "There is still such a thing! It seems that you have found a great treasure! But why give it to me, do you want to wander around irresponsibly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Richard instantly solidified and opened his mouth, but there was no rebuttal. In the end, he only reluctantly admitted: "I want to walk around and prepare for the final battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last battle? Who believes!" No face shrugs his face, then grabs the light group from Richard's hand, and with a hand, the light group is integrated into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her and indulged for a while, saying: "No face..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the bad thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When let me see what you look like!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Li did not expect is that no face is very refreshing this time: "Yes! When you come back from the dark side of the world, I will take off the mask for you to see."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and let no face leave first. He looked up at the almost rainbow in July and began to examine the territory and the various private planes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
