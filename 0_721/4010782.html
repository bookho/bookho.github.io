			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the swaying magic light, Nyris uses the petals of orchid petals The letter sent by Richard was launched, it was not a letter addressed to him, but a statement, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first sacred alliance of Emperor Philippe the Great The Fourth Emperor, His Royal Highness, is the eternal ally of the Akmand family. Any country, family, or individual who has a decision concerning the interests of His Royal Highness must first reach an understanding with the Archimonde family. Otherwise, That is the enemy of my life, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hereby declare,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Holy Alliance, Richard. Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a statement of asylum, without reservation and without a deadline, this is the gift that Richard left for him, it was Richard The promises promised, to Richard’s status in the Holy Alliance today, throughout the Noord, the weight of this statement is heavy, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese looks at it In this statement, suddenly there is a crystal teardrop on the letter paper, splashing a beautiful water splash,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sitting like this, sitting At dusk, sit down at the stars, then sit down at dawn, when the morning light is as golden as the golden room, and the room is full of sighs, and Niris can sigh softly, pick up the statement, and tear it apart. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same day, the unique transmission of the royal family in the floating hall of the floating world, one after another, when the royal knight who finished the road finished, from the transmission array Out of dozens of young aristocratic children, they are frustrated, others are exuberant, and these young people are characterized by more or less injuries to their bodies,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This batch is the young aristocratic son who returned from the safari. Today is the last round of competition. It can be proved here that they can be excellent. No matter how the results, everyone can get more or less. Royal funding, for young people who are mostly from small aristocrats, this means They have already stood on the same starting line with the big aristocratic children. Of course, this starting line cannot be compared with the floating island giants. However, most of the young people who can go to this round will be seen by several giants. When you get out of the olive branch, joining the giants is another option, and you will get even more resources than you can get from the royal family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter what the grades are, these young people are still in the sunshine, waiting for them to be a more brilliant future, as long as they are not too ambitious,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi'an is also At least one of these sunny teenagers seems to be that Winnington is not outstanding in the crowd, and even because of the many injuries on his body, he is very embarrassed, but others look at his eyes, but he is envious.嫉妒, 嫉妒 even hate, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people waiting in the hall, most of them are elders of these young families, for many small families, These young people are the hope of family rejuvenation, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decorated Vinica is like a fire that rushes to Lucien and pulls his hand and asks: "How? , won't win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian's face passed over a haze, and then smiled casually, saying: "It's almost, you Archimonde, It’s crazy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinika, Channel: "Well, how can you lose, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a thick and steady voice came from the side: "Venica, You look like this, my brother will be upset."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica was shocked, took a step back, a little further away from Lucien, turned to look When she arrived in Winnington, she changed her face and some cringed, but then she remembered something and rushed to Winnington. She asked loudly, "Is it you won Lu Xi'an."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington nodded: "I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinikara with Winnington's armor, Li Sheng asked: "You, how can you win, it must be that your brother helped you, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington’s face flashed with anger He slammed Vinica's hand and said, "Vonika, don't forget your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is my identity? Anyway, my brother can’t help it privately. If it is not for the brother to intervene, how can you win?" Venica's voice is getting bigger and bigger,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arkmond's brother and sister quarrel Attracting everyone's attention, the surrounding aristocrats are all concerned about it, and whispering, and even snickering from time to time, many people are pondering the possibility of shady, to observe the status of today, to intervene, get It’s easy to come out of the championship, but in the sacred alliance of the endless battle, the slightly aristocrats know that this kind of champion is meaningless, and throwing the guy who has no real skills on the battlefield is killing him. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi'an also felt a little bad. He took Vinica and said, "Okay, don't make trouble. It's not about other people. It's my own consideration that I don't have a good soldier before I lose to Winnington. He It’s a real knight, it’s not going to do this. In addition, the second place is not bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinika hurriedly: “But you need those Reward, Winnington doesn't need it, my brother even has prepared a small team of knights for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words stirred up a discussion among the nobility, Naturally, I am amazed at the richness of Archimonde. Even such a young man can get a small team of knights. God knows that most of the Viscounts can't get a small team of knights,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington took a deep breath and said: "Vinika, what you are doing today will tell me my brother, and, in addition, Lucien, my advice to you is with Winnie. The card stays at a distance, at least until she completes her family obligations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venica still argues but is Xi'an stopped, Lu Xi'an showed a confident and charming smile, said: "I believe that I have reached a tacit agreement with Richard, so the relationship between me and Vinica does not require you to worry, in addition, I have to give you a It is recommended that, like a desperate attempt, the strategy of the whole army assault can only be successful once. If you meet on the battlefield next time, you will not have a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenning When he snorted and did not argue with Lu Xi'an, he walked to the gate. At this moment, the aristocrats gathered at the entrance of the main hall suddenly had a commotion, separated from the two sides, and a team of fully armed knights left. In the main hall, the coat of arms of Archimonde, the head of a female knight has a short flame-like hair. Many nobles recognize the female goddess of the Archimonde family and are one of the few famous members of the Holy Alliance. Ellie, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s eyes swept through the aristocratic youth, and immediately fell on Lucien’s body, striding toward him,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucien." Ellie’s gaze She couldn't see the slightest fluctuations, and her tone was very calm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am." Lucien looked pale and seemed to think of something,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go with me." Ellie reached out and grabbed Lucien, but her hand was halfway, but she was caught,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long, pale hand, completely in line with the aesthetics of the nobility, and it was easy to stop Alice’s grasp. Obviously, the strength was far above Alice, and then the unique voice of the turbid stream was in Ellie’s ear. It sounded: "The beautiful count, these young people, but the royal family should focus on training. You just want to take them away. It seems that something is wrong. Can you give me a reason, no matter what the reason, as long as it can I am satisfied with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice took a step and pulled away the distance from the turbidity. She couldn’t stand the distance, but from the right Dangerous intuition, instinctively unwilling to approach the turbidity, the turbidity is like a very poisonous snake, the farther away the better,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice takes out A piece of stationery was handed over to the turbidity, saying: "This Lucien has stolen the magical soul of His Royal Highness, and he must pay for this crime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic soul." Some of the aristocrats in the crowd immediately exclaimed, a magical soul almost Same as half a fifth-order structure, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien suddenly raised his arms and shouted loudly: "What magical soul, I have never seen it before. What magical soul, you said that you have stolen the magical soul, evidence, I am also a noble, want to dispose of me, must go through the trial of the parliament, but the evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He didn't mean to escape, his voice was impassioned, and he turned to the onlookers. He said loudly: "My family is just a small aristocrat. Naturally, there is no way to compare it with Archimonde, but if you think about it, if it is I stole the magical soul. Can His Royal Highness have tolerated me to the present, or the sentence, the evidence, the trial must have evidence, today Archimonde can take me without evidence, and he can use it tomorrow. The same means to take you away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of nobles moving, they can not help but think of the battle for the blue moon, many fascinating The family is taking risks and actually has a lot of relationships with Richard. Resentment, although the agreement at the time was not to be considered, but bloody hatred is so easy to forget, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "should be submitted to the aristocratic court of the upper house for deliberation." Attachment, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li’s face has cooled down, her hand is on the hilt, and as many as twenty knights behind her also reach out to the sword. The voices of the nobles were much lighter at the moment. At this time, Richard was already a sacred sect, and his status was long before the plane. These nobles, even if they had more people and greed, did not dare to provoke again. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
