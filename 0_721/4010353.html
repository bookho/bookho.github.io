He saw that Raymond was still drinking tea in the courtyard while studying the wind and land of Faro. When he saw Richard, Raymond smiled again. He greeted him, and Richard had the urge to teach him a moment, but now it is obviously not the time to calculate the old account with the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mito’s courtyard door is closed, and the servant who takes care of his daily life tells Richard that the master is meditating and is said to have been seriously injured in the war of God. I am not disturbed now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark and Sandru are both in the northwest direction, they are bloody suppression of the barbarian's counterattack, in the battle of God, the barbarian in the ancestral highlands is not willing to pass Failure, but also set up an army to capture the wall of the trade wind, the end of the war, the first thing the followers are to transfer the military front, to recapture this traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Richard could not find one to ask about the overall situation of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desperation, Richard walked into the Great Shrine of the goddess of spring water. I heard that when Richard returned, Philun immediately greeted him personally and enthusiastically Richard dragged into the apse. The new pope is already a big priest at the 17th level. The look of joy is like a girl. She almost holds the entire arm of Licha in her arms and uses the word drag to describe it. Very apt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi did not care about the white eyes of Philen, but also followed in, with her force, where to go, no one in the entire Great Shrine could stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next hour, Richard finally figured out the general process of the war and understood the source of Philip’s enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mortal war coming to an end, the fighting officers and the Knights of the Temple in Zhong’an suffered heavy losses, especially in order to save the Son of God, the Knights of the Temple were almost completely destroyed. It is said that the rest of the entire church, even if it is a reserve, can not maintain a squadron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the most loyal followers. Their war death directly affects the inner faith of Nei’an and makes the war of the gods of Neian unsustainable. Do not retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of the mortal war situation, during the late War of the War of the Kingdom, Nei An did not take any advantage. The warriors of the gods fought in the other side of the gods. The suppression was very serious. The losses of the two sides were not equal. The speed can be quickly determined, and the result directly leads to the loss expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medium-minded inner security against the endangered forests and the hunting goddess can barely maintain the loss of the two sides, in the goddess of the spring water gods can be said to be a loss It’s a heavy one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior who died in his kingdom of God will eventually be absorbed and transformed into a part of the goddess of the three goddesses, so the loss of the inner security after the retreat, and the forest And the goddess of hunting is free from the endangered situation, and the kingdom of God becomes firm and stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the victory of the mortal war, Philen received the new gift of the goddess of spring water, the level was directly raised to the seventeenth level, and the goddess of spring water was awarded A secret god, if Philen can get a child from Richard, then it will be the next pope, and the film itself will be promoted to the 18th level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess directly promotes the ranks of the clergy, and the power of the beliefs accumulated by them is also a great loss, so only those who have built great merits will always Get the gods who directly upgrade the level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is such a god, Fioren and Richard explain the beginning and end of this war, the hot body always subconsciously goes to Richard. Relying on, seeing Fasqi’s eyes smoldering, she did not have any thoughts on Richard, but out of her loyalty to Alize, and she felt that she had the obligation to protect Richard from wild women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Richard to re-examine the process of God’s war from the narration of Philip’s mistakes and reversed order. This is quite difficult. The work allowed Richard to sigh how Fioron took the position of the Pope. If it weren’t for his own appearance, the church of the Fountain Goddess was estimated to have been smashed by Philen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the apparently abnormal enthusiasm of Philen made Richard feel a bit too much to eat. Fortunately, there was a fascination by Faschi, and Richard forgive me not to do it. What happened? But then again, even if there is Faschi, Philen is so hot, obviously there is another reason behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s related to the goddess of spring water, and Richard is thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying goodbye to Philen, Richard flew directly to his war room, and Faschi stayed for a little longer, and blocked the film from the Pope Hall very hard. This was the only way to chase after Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war room, Richard launched a map of the blood-stained land and began to sketch the entire war on the map, watching, Richard’s double The eyebrows gradually locked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of war is very strange, from the strength of the force to the loss of casualties, there are too many mysteries, looking at the overall situation, especially the latter half, their own strategy It can be said to be almost superb. Even if Richard himself comes to command, there is such a powerful reconnaissance means as an elite bat. However, because there are enough strong people in the hands of Richard, some places may be directly flat. Push hard attacks, but not so hard to find a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to play such a war with the ability of Clark and the mother’s nest, to be able to fight an absolute disadvantage of war to this extent, to abandon the strong war I don't think about it. In Richard's impression, it seems that only Elliott, Saranwell, and Raymond can do it. Oh, there is also a Gotton who has turned war into art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking of the name, Richard’s heart tightened, so he swept the name of Gordon out of his heart if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put down the map and went straight to Raymond’s small courtyard. Raymond was still drinking tea and reading, but the location moved from the yard to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This war is your command." Richard did not circle him, and said straight to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond put down the book and the teacup, looked at Richard seriously, and sighed and said, "You know so soon, it seems better than I was supposed to be smarter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, there is a flash of Sen Han’s light, saying, "How do you say the mother's nest?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond shrugged and said, "A small agreement, the content is of no importance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but He looked at Richard's increasingly sharp eyes and reluctantly spread his hand and said, "Don't be so serious, it's really not a big deal. Well, you see, the content of the agreement has come."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white bird flew in from the courtyard wall, fluttering in the familiar door and jumping in from the half-covered window. It was very beautiful, and the smart eyes flashed with wisdom. Richard saw this at a glance. It is the creation of the mother's nest, but why the always-fashioned mother's nest suddenly has the leisure to create such a flashy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bird screamed, spewing a crystal of beads from his mouth, and then fluttering away again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond picked up the beads and threw them directly into his mouth. Then he said, "No wonder, this is something that can sustain my life. That bird is me." The special species that grew up from the small plane, I recently liked to recall some past events, let the hens help me to make this bird, and the material that sustains life is also swallowed in this way. No one likes to be in the next few days. I was stunned by a big mosquito. I have been having a long nightmare. I slept very well this month. In return, I helped you win this war. You see, it’s as simple as that." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Raymond quietly, still didn’t speak, and didn’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond eventually seemed to be unable to withstand the eyes of Richard, but said helplessly: "Okay, you won, you took the Master Mito, and put He was here, and it was not long before the war started. Master Mito was forced to go to the front line. Once he appeared on the battlefield alone, it was almost a dead end. Master Mito saved me many times. I owe him. A lot of life, can't watch him die like this and do nothing, so I reached a small agreement with the mother's nest to help you fight this war, and I can also improve my life by the way. That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "You helped me win this war, and I am not afraid that my strength will continue to expand and kill Joseph." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, you are too modest, I will not shoot, you will not really lose this war, the most loss of misery, war and destruction The species has already allowed you to grow to this level, and what else is scary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichamo For a moment, he said: "The hatred of my family and the Joseph family cannot be resolved, but I still want to thank you this time. When I annihilate Joseph, I will consider kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond just smiled and picked up the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
