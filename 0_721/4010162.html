Richard is now looking forward to what kind of surprise the seventh-order mother's nest can bring to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking stock of all the strengths, Richard has a strong sense of strength. If Saranwell is coming back now, and with so many troops last time, Richard is confident that he can't find North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the blood-stained land is quiet, the Iron Triangle Empire seems to be content with the Sequoia Kingdom. The nobility of the empire's southern Xinjiang did not go back to the bloody land to find the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons, but the main ones are only two. First, it is necessary to face the same dilemma as that of Saranwell. It is no good to win. The consequences are serious. The summit of the imperial prince and the national interest is not the same. Other nobles simply do not. There may be such considerations. In addition, not every aristocrat can see the horror of Richard: young, talented, hardworking, using soldiers as gods, the most deadly is political mind. The second point is that there are Jaranwell and Lambert's car in the past, where the self-sufficiency is not comparable to the two, of course, not to the bloody place to die. During this time, the Masters Association suddenly became a lot more honest, and did not send anyone to find fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, Richard had an unprecedented army in hand, and he could not find the enemy of the war, and the emotion of the useless land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and shook his head, thinking that the situation in front of him was the result of countless bloody battles in the past year. Isn’t it better? What he lacks most is time. After giving him three months, Richard's magic can climb to the 14th level, and then make a set of suits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the enemy of Richard, the most tragic thing is that as long as they have been through a few months, they will find themselves facing a new look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Richard sighed and said to himself: "I still have a few unopened guys to let me activities!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richards stepped out of the Magic Lab and routinely learned about Oasis City and the training status of his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tour caravan to the furnace kingdom is on the way back. The total return of this round trip is about 3 million, which is more than normal. In the future, with the increasing number of caravans, the price will fluctuate accordingly, and the income will decline. In the case of equilibrium, the return of a caravan should be around 1.5 million. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But according to news from the caravan in advance, the king of the furnace king Bamore has decided to take measures to encourage the dwarf after receiving the second batch of 3,000 tons of food. People give birth. Not only the dwarf aristocracy, but also the civilian class can also let go of the birth, and the new dwarf will receive a certain reward from the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dwarf’s life span is generally between one and five to three hundred. It is only after the age of fifteen that it can only begin to give birth. Only one child can be born a year. The fertility rate of intelligent life is inversely proportional to the length of the individual life. In addition to the survival rate caused by living in the natural environment, the increase in the number of dwarves will be a slow process. The population is directly determined by the strength of the furnace kingdom. However, Richard has already planned well. As long as the source of the food is sent to the past, the furnace kingdom will soon embark on the road of external merger and expansion, and merge other small tribes into the kingdom. The so-called grain is too thick, this is the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came out and circled, what Richard heard was good news, and there was nothing to open up the aristocrats to provoke him. It is impossible for all nobles to recognize Richard, and everyone is too late to settle. Looking at their enthusiasm, Richard knows that even if there are one or two guys who don’t open their eyes, they definitely can’t get their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard can only return to his own room and continue to compete with himself in the world of construction and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day is like this, night falls again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sand came back to the residence, I saw that Io was waiting for myself. The fighting officer is serious in his face, and his eyebrows are locked. The quicksand was shocked by the attitude of the fighting priest and asked: "Isra, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I need to talk to you Said Io. In fact, unlike what the outside world sees, when Russia and the sand are alone, they will talk in a very respectful and formal tone. It is like the attitude of all the guardians of the heavens to their guardians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, come in." The sand drove open the door of his study and let Iowa come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islam closed the door of the study, sat on the opposite side of the sand, staring at the eyes of the sand, and said seriously: "The sand of the temple, Richard's magic has been ten "Three levels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the flowing sand is full of smiles that satisfy happiness, saying: "Yes! Yes, he is very powerful? In fact, he should have been there. Thirteenth grade, but only some time ago has been strengthening the bloodline ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that he was only eleventh level more than three months ago. But now it is thirteen!" Io stressed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the sands don’t understand, ask: “Yes, that’s right. What’s wrong, is Richard’s upgrade slower?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! It's too fast! At this speed, he will reach level 14 after three months, and will become fifteen after one year. And I, now only Fourteen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?" There was a constant smile on the face of the sand, nodded, waiting for the words of Iowa, but in her eyes The joy has calmed down and it has become clear and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I think you should consider raising my level cap in the next sacrifice. Otherwise, my current limit can only be increased to ten. At the sixth level, it is still in the case of full combat, and it will take two years for Richard to surpass me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand suddenly laughed. Said: "You are worried about this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Iowa admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, what about the sacrifices? So far, all the sacrifices are almost all that Richard thinks of." Observe the sacrifices from the bloody battles and use them to raise your upper limit so that you can continue to suppress him and sway in front of him. Is this appropriate?" The sand is so funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a good fit!" Io is not at all polite. Of course, under normal circumstances, the combat squad in the ranks is definitely one of the top priority candidates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not feel a sigh, took a picture of his forehead and sighed: "How did I change you like this idiot! You know that if I have enough now God's grace, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io shook his head and said, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will change another guardian! It is also a fighting sect!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpectedly heavy blow. The fighting sergeants feel that there is a gap in consciousness, and they can’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't give me an explanation that will satisfy me, then I will put the idea just into action." Anyone who knows her knows that the sand will not change once it is determined. Although the fighting sergeant did not follow her for a long time, due to the relationship between the two sides, the fluent sand is well understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian, then seriously said: "In fact, I did not want to plunder the sacrifices that Richard received, but because of the power of you and me, With a part of the army, I was fully capable of searching for the sacrifices independently in this plane. But for three months, Richard did not move. I followed his followers twice, each time just clearing some horses. It’s nothing more than a challenge. It’s impossible to get a sacrifice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted down and seemed to be thinking about something. After a while, he said: Iowa, I feel that you are somewhat different from other heavenly guards. First of all, I want to ask, do you know what is the purpose of my choice of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Io is very reluctant to say: "In order to return to the Eternal Dragon Hall, Richard's team can still have a powerful priest who can reverse the local situation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded and said: "Know it! Your usual performance often makes me illusion, you have not gotten at first The instruction at the time of selection. I don't understand where your hostility towards Richard comes from, but if you have your own ideas and don't want to cooperate with Richard, then I have to change the guard of the day. Next time I will Choose a female combat sergeant. Although I am very reluctant to put a beautiful woman around Richard, it is much better than leaving him an enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Israel's face changed indefinitely, and finally sighed and said: "I understand. I admit, I am really different from those ordinary guardians. Although they also have souls, they are actually quite smart. But you don't have to worry about me, I am more hostile to Richard, and I will only overwhelm him from the front, not to play tricks behind the scenes, and not to do things that are intentionally delayed. Although in your mind, I am only A creation of the eternal and the dragon of time, but I also have dignity. In addition, I think you should be very clear during this time, those defensive guards of the heavens can not compare with me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flowing sand raises the eye I looked at Io indifferently and said, "Well, I believe you this time. But if you want to upgrade your level, let’s go to the 16th level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Israel sighed and said nothing. The ranks of combat priests are different from those of magicians. The more the magical use of the Russian and Russian gods, the more people benefit from the magic, and the faster his rank is raised. Therefore, the land of war is his land. Another way is to upgrade by God. Therefore, for the three months of peace and quiet for Richard, for Iraq and Russia, it is three months without any loss of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is low, but the city of Oasis is still happy, and many places are brightly lit. In the past three months, the number of pubs in the city has doubled, and so often the family is full. Many people have already made a fortune from the first war of the line, and soon the caravan will come back, and there will be a lot of gold coins pouring into their wallets. Therefore, in the past few days, the whole city is in the carnival. Even in the middle of the night, there will always be three or five groups of drunks walking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
