			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a critical juncture, Richard suddenly had a countermeasure and forced the sand to hold it. Say: "You are you, different from everyone else. Also, I am of course your man. If you want to change a man, there is no door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey." Flowing sand and a sip, gently let go of Richard, did not care about his ambiguity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and followers returned to the Black Rose Fortress, most of the followers will continue to cross the plane to Faro, the deep red Principality in the ancestral highlands When the festival advances, it is natural to chase after victory, and Richard and Liusha will return to the floating world, and then the sand will remain in the Eternal Dragon Hall, and Richard will continue to hone in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Rose Castle, there is a letter waiting for Richard, there is no signature on the letter, only the attendant left the note and only said that it was from Deep Blue. The remote magic transmission array was sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the word, Richard’s heart twitched a little, and Deep Blue now has a special meaning for him, not just where he learns and grows. It was also the source of the greatest humiliation in his life. He was beaten for the first time without any help, and then he was driven out of the dark blue like a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I finally realized that there was no unfavorable thought to Su Hailun at the beginning, but what he said was like a red-hot soldering iron. In the heart of Richard, his heart burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s mind, he did not even fall back to the dark blue, not to mention a deep sleep in Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absolute battlefield, Richard couldn’t even have a rest for a while, as long as he slept a little later, he would wake up awkwardly, then those who were too early The pain will sing in the ear, and every sentence will be astonished by Richard, so he will immediately climb up and continue along the established road. Richard has the will and has Patience, one of his wishes, is to give a slap in the face of a certain day in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Deep Blue actually came to a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not rush to open, but closed his eyes and thought for a while, now he is still not a vain opponent, let alone too early I want to understand this, and Richard has fixed his mind and opened the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a blank letter in the envelope, nothing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but be awkward, but just as he unfolded the stationery, he suddenly felt a tiny magical energy in the paper and a bullet on Richard. And fell back to the letterhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter paper trembled, and it sounded the beginning of the voice: "Licha, I know it is you, others can't hear what I have to say, You listened, I am dying now, can't stay here more, you come to a dark blue, I have something to tell you, I am not joking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed it for a while, didn’t understand what it meant in the beginning, but what made him even more awkward was that the power of the beginning was too strong, and suddenly it would suddenly become seriously injured and killed. What kind of existence can hurt him? In this way, Richard has not seen the legend. Although he was just a short-time legend in the early days, his legendary ability is obviously extremely powerful, and it is not comparable to the general legendary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic on the letterhead has been exhausted, and Richard thought about it and carefully burned it to ashes with a magical flame, then went to find the sand, let She first went back to the Eternal Dragon Hall, and Richard himself passed the ultra-remote magic portal to the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chayi walked out of the transmission array, and the two mages who had already waited for him greeted him and prayed to Richard: "His Royal Highness has already waited for you." For a long time, please come with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the first meeting with Richard was the top of the dark blue, and it has been repaired without seeing the traces of violent violence. But as soon as Richard stepped out of the transmission array, he frowned and then calmed his own fluctuating mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two chairs and a table on the wide platform, sitting there slowly drinking slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard saw the beginning, the corner of his eyes shrank involuntarily, and then he calmed down. If he had no time to go to the table, sit down in the chair opposite the beginning. Then looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this position, you can overlook the ice floes in the winter. The scenery is extremely devastating, and there is another kind of grand flavor. But now it is deep winter, the cold style is outside, the ear is filled with the whistling wind, and the people with weaker strength are at all. I can't sit here for a long time, but at the beginning I only wore a thin mage robe, and people looked cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight, watching Richard, his eyes are still full of jokes and smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I naturally can’t report any good looks, even if I knew that she was not malicious to Su Hailun at the beginning, but this does not mean that he is not malicious to Richard. A strong insult, and in front of a large magician, has long been beyond the scope of any jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha came back for Su Hailun, not intending to give in to the beginning of the age, he could never do the smile that was able to treat himself so much, so Li The pen was sitting very well, and his face was as calm as an ice floes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, quite good, it seems that you have gained a lot in the past year or so, and this level of progress is justified." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and said: "More than a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it is a year Many, do you think that only the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple know how to trace the passage of time.” The initial questioning made Richard mutter, he really thought so, and most people in Noland think so. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard’s expression, he smiled slightly at first, saying: “Richard, if you want to be a real powerhouse, then don’t With the power of others, everything depends on you. You must learn to analyze and master all the rules involved in the future power. As many times, the time and space are almost the rules that will be involved in most areas of power. You should not give up exploring in this area because you have a quicksand around you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bottom of the heart admits that it makes sense at the beginning, he is insinuating Flowing sand, which made Richard quite uncomfortable, said: "The sand does not let me give up. On the contrary, she will tell me the rules I need to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, I smiled a little: "She told you, it must be right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence immediately made Richard's face gloomy and said coldly: "I believe that the sand will never lie to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never" The word, Richard bites very heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since you said so, then I believe." At the beginning, I smiled faintly, and did not intend to argue with Richard on this matter. Instead, the voice turned and asked: "But if she knows what is wrong, do you think that a godsman will be able to thoroughly understand the relevant rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence asks that Richard is speechless, and the gods certainly cannot fully understand the relevant rules. Otherwise, it is not a god, but a god. The gods are related to the gods. The field has natural advantages, but the gods of the same god have more or less understanding of the rules. How much does it comprehend? In fact, it means that there are many misunderstandings, so in this sense, Liusha tells Richard. Time and space rules, let alone whether Richard can understand, it is doomed to be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can understand all the rules, or completely understand a certain rule in a certain field." Richard retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first smiled: "It seems that you have learned a lot, but this should not be a reason. You know what I am talking about. Let’s talk about it from another angle. If the sand is all true to you, you must have the ability to identify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call me over, not to be I said this," Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, shrugging, said: "Of course not, I just remind you by the way, don't rely too much on the Eternal Dragon Hall. It is almost in the middle of the real strong. Common sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, I will remember." Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to remember, this is not my business, I will only remind you this time, or look at the past year or so you are still working hard For the sake of it, now, let’s talk about business.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I was not in a hurry to continue the topic, but to pick up the glass and drink slowly. While tapping the table with his hand, his gaze fell on the frozen ice floes. The focus didn't know where it was. Richard was still sitting quietly, not urging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
