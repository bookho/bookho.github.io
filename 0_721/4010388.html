The structure similar to this one, I just saw it on the tortoise of Maranus, but it is not as comprehensive as this anti-xìng, but it should not be in Dak. The natural structure of the Soudas plane, perhaps these devil fish is the child of the brain-eating Maranos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people here are vomiting It is obviously a lot easier, even if there are more children of Maranos, it is not a concept with mass production. Love 唛鎷灞癹<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Maranos is dead now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lawrence still frowned. Obviously, the middle-aged man’s words could not dispel his doubts. He thought for a while and said, “This is hard to say. Very well, you see, the magical resistance of this structure is indeed high enough, but its biggest problem is that the bearing capacity is very poor. If you want to maintain the necessary physical strength and activity, then the body size can not exceed ten meters, from this Point of view, the devil fish is the possibility of the descendants of Maranos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged are thinking about it, saying: "Malanos maybe It's a variant, maybe these devil fish are just the bloody descendants it uses to hunt, so that can be explained!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lawrence said: "This Maybe xìng does, but not big, we can't deliberately think about the situation in the right direction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the devil fish is indeed a mass production, you Can there be any better way now?" The middle-aged man retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence's face sè slightly changed, showing anger, but as the middle-aged said, he has no way at all, just at this time, has been silent General Lundstedt spoke up: "Well, no matter what the origin of the devil fish, obviously our old opponents have given us a problem, but this is nothing, how many difficulties have been in the past, we are not I have spent the same time, and now I am taking back the Xu Rì's first rise, so there is nothing to be afraid of, but we must do something, we can't sit and watch the situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the marshal’s gaze fell on Richard and said, “Richard, you can now tailor the second-order suit!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard slightly succumbs and says, "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a saying that more than half of the people in the room immediately moved, they were very clear about the tailor-made two What does the level suit mean? It seems that there is a lot of enthusiasm and respect in the eyes of Richard. A big builder means that the strength of the strongmen can be raised out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of Richard has already shaken the Holy Alliance, but it has not yet reached the point where it can be immediately transmitted to the field, so there are still many people who are not clear. The deeds of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Richard, help people who don’t fall into the city to do more construction, this is the most direct way for us to improve our strength." Marshal said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to the marshal’s words, Richard frowned and shook his head and said, “I’m going to the battlefield, I’m trying to sharpen my own strength. I will make it at my discretion. But this is not my main purpose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Dested reveals a clear smile and says, "Don’t rush to refuse, draw The process of loading is actually a process of sorting up the knowledge and power of magic. Now it is an extraordinary period. We really need a lot of constructions. So, from now on, all the magic materials will be supplied to you at half price. The price of the acquisition is 20% higher. In addition, our stock of sacrifices can also be sold to you at half price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggestion immediately makes Richard feel moved. The price of the Marshal is too high, so high that he can hardly refuse, not to mention Richard's battlefield. One of the purposes is to make a breakthrough in the construction, and the Marshal is not clear that Richard is in the construction. In terms of the super high success rate, it is not clear how much Richard will earn in this. Profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if the marshal is clear, he will do the same. In his eyes, as long as he can get enough construction, Richard does not care how much money Richard makes in it, because Only Richard can make such a profit. If you change other builders, I am afraid that it will not work. The so-called big event is not a small one. This is also a kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha some hard to say: "This, Marshal... Sorry, I will make some decorations, but I am afraid I can’t stay in it all the time. I have drawn the structure, I...must be strong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Ronster Stewart was quite surprised, even St. Lawrence looked at it with a strange look. With Richard, such preferential conditions are not desperate to do the construction, it is simply to push the wealth sent to the door, the more the place is the battlefield, the stronger the more people pay more attention to wealth, because wealth can be quickly transformed into real strength Part of it, only a few parts of the abnormality like the white night is the exception, and the marshal also provides another condition that can not be refused, that is, the sale of the sacrifices stored in the rì capital is sold to Richard, or half price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal quickly nodded and said, "Oh, this kind of thing can't be reluctant. As long as you provide the decoration for the people who don't fall, the two conditions have been valid, and the number of structures is Don't do hard xìng requirements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Dested looked around for a week and saw that everyone in the room was worried, so he smiled and said: In fact, you don't have to worry. If the situation can't support it, we can also ask for help from the strong people of Calando and Qing Cang. It is related to the safety of the entire plane. They will not sit idly by. The price we pay is only later. It’s no big deal in front of them, but it’s no big deal!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a glimpse of the crowd, and then the murderousness is getting worse, even Richard is sitting upright Only a glimpse of the nameless fire is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Richard, they are all strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong is the dignity and pride of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that maybe in the next few decades, it will become the laughing stock of the whole Noland, and I will not be able to lift my head in front of the strongmen of the two continents. Everyone thinks The face is hot like a fire, and the strongman of Noland's mainland always thinks that Noland is the center of the plane. How can he be looked down on this big event, Karando and the guys who have lost their hands? overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Richard, the Qing dynasty’s jīng spirits are gone, and Calando is a place that is deeply intertwined with him. The picture of the future mountains and the sea, let Li subconsciously hate the entire Calando system, and all the young strongmen who are ready to participate in the battle for the mountains and the sea, this kind of hatred is strong, from that barbaric It can be seen from the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If forced to ask for help from the powerful Calando, for Richard, it is more insulting than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the reaction of the people, the marshal sighed heavily and said, "You, I don’t want this, and it’s better to live with it than to lose dignity. We are dying, but we are not only representing ourselves here. Behind us are the family and friends living in Noland, and many people who know or don’t know. It is our responsibility. I always feel that Responsibility, above our personal dignity and honor, well, let everyone prepare, I hope we have more care this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people left the rì暮 temple with a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, it seems that there is no difference between the past and the past, but the atmosphere has become a little heavy and depressed, the ordinary strong in the city and outside the city. They don't know what happened, but they instinctively feel that something is not good, so the action is more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard occupied an empty house not far from the St. Lawrence store, cleaned it, and lived there, then Richard went. A warehouse in the city of Rì, bought a lot of magic materials, and then a box of spirits, in the next rì, Richard almost stayed out of the house, meditating in the room every day, or lasting for hours Uninterrupted practice of the knife, and sometimes there is inspiration, so I can not sleep in the room to draw the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes, Richard will sit at the door again, watching the passing pedestrians, drinking their own wine in silence, until the wine is over, just rely on On the wall, I fell asleep, and in the city of Rì, even the Sanctuary’s strong people lived a life of precariousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the noon the next day, Richard was awakened from the hangover, he shook his head in a distressed pain, stood up straight, looked up and looked up The dark clouds in the air, yawning, Richard casually kicked a bunch of empty bottles next to him, returned to the room, gently stroked three long knives and fate Gemini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intoxication, Richard made another dream, a dream that still lingers in his mind until now, perhaps drunk too much, maybe It’s a dream that is too realistic. For a moment, Richard has some doubts about whether these dreams are true or what is going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, leaving the knife and the destiny behind him, and left the room, the door was not locked, and Richard opened the door to Lawrence. Throw a box of magical boxes into it, and wait until Lawrence comes out, and then go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lawrence was sleeping in the morning on his own experimental bench, and a loud bang when the magic box landed, suddenly scared him from the bench. Jumped up, stumbled and screamed: "The bastard dares to quarrel with Laozi to sleep. When Laozi cuts your things, you can't wait a few more hours. Don't be so anxious to die, he ***!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the old man’s snoring spurted out of the door, Richard had already gone far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
