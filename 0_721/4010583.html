			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of another fierce battle, Richard communicated the tree of life, Telling its own decision, the consciousness of the night tree of life is very weak at the moment, and the numerous wounds in the tree have been unable to heal itself. It can only communicate through consciousness, and even the simple tree image cannot be condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, I can hold them for a while." The tree of life is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "You surrender, don't fight for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But ...... "The night tree of life is hesitating. Richard knows what it hesitates. After surrender, it means that the tree of life will be included in the world tree. This is the eternal coming from Noland. In terms of the night tree of life, it can be said that it is a very humiliating thing. From the perspective of life level, the tree of the night is not worse than the tree of the world of Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First come alive, I will be back soon, at the door of the plane, and my army."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yong Night Life Tree finally nodded: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with the Everlasting Life Tree, the Night Elf is over there When something went wrong, Ellie told the Eternal Elf that only half of the people were able to leave the team. On the question of which people could leave, the Eternal Night Elf and Ellie had a disagreement. According to Alize, The best solution is to take away all elite warriors, as well as children and young female elves. The rest does not constitute immediate combat power, but also has no use for the future growth of the tribe. They can stay and choose to fight, or they can choose to surrender. It doesn't matter what you are saying. Even if you keep the entire Yongye tribe, you are just looking for death. Therefore, the elves who are eliminated have nothing to do. They only need to consume a few guardian elf warriors, but as long as Richard returns to the advancement. The base, rallying the army and followers, will not care at the time Elf few more or a few less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the night elves don’t think so, all elite warriors, including the two great Druids and the two sacred hunters, are willing to stay, and Let a large number of old and weak and female elves in the tribe withdraw. In their eyes, the death of war is the duty and pride of the warrior, and the higher elves are hierarchical, but the higher ranks and rights of the warriors are accompanied by more Responsibility, at this time, the protection of low-level ordinary people is their vocation, although there are also guys like gray feathers in the night elves, but after a series of changes, the rest are all abiding by tradition. Predator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ellie does not agree. The reason is that the old weak elves are too slow to move, so the time to return to the base city will be greatly extended, and in order to protect these elves without any self-protection, the knights will have to fight blood. In a few games, in the eyes of Ellie, every battle means a few names that will be removed from the roster of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two sides were arguing, Richard went down from the tree of life and stopped the snarling Alice, and immediately ordered ten weak players. Construct the knights, let them go to the magic ride, then call their holy unicorns, let some old and weak night elves ride, and then admit that this is the limit that can be done, and for the real future of the tribe Richard still hopes that the elite hunters and Druids can retreat together, but Richard finally handed the decision to the Yongye Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Elf also knows that time is tight, after deliberation, about one-third of the elite warriors left, and a Sanctuary hunter volunteered to stay, led All the left-behind people were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at the sacred hunter after the voluntary break and said, "You can surrender, I will be back soon."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary hunter gave Richard a high courteous ritual and solemnly said: "We will never surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang opened his mouth, but just nodded and did not force again. At this time, the two eternal night elves who decided to retreat and a sacred hunter also performed a high courtesy to Richard. Solemnly said that in the future, he will completely obey the order of Richard, and the entire Yongyue tribe will become the next member of the Lichao, only to watch the Yongye tribe with less than 500 people left. I am not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These must be, the retreating team is set off, time is now the most urgent resource, and those who give the Eternal Elf are almost full of slow movements. The eternal night elf, Richard himself walked on the ground, everyone knows that Richard’s injury is not good at all. This can be seen from the fact that he can’t put out a large amount of magic, and Ellie is also riding from the magic. Jumped down and let a few night elves get on their magic ride, and she walked alongside Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team walked in the dark woods. After a while, Ellie finally couldn’t help but asked, "Why."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not answer, but looked up and looked around, I saw no matter whether it was a night elf or a knight, there is a subtle change in his attitude towards him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this, Richard said: "In order to ... the world is returning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is returning." Ellie licked this sentence repeatedly, but again Some don't understand, want to return to the world, the army pushes the past, and then the means is softer, not natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for her to think through, suddenly saw that Richard’s body was shaking, his face suddenly changed, and Richard stopped and slowly turned back. In the direction of the tree of life, not only Richard, but also the strongest of the three eternal night elves, and Li looked in the same direction. From there, they all felt the turmoil, that is the tree of life. Extremely painful nickname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night tree of life is madly patted with branches and roots, and the old trees in the forest are swept down in rows, but the shadows are like lightning. I jumped out of the forest and threw myself into the tree of life. Those shadows were guardian elves, but they were very different from the ordinary guardian elves. They had a big circle and their skin turned grayish black. Layers of folds, you can also see sporadic small scales, they are not only large, but also much faster than the ordinary guardian elves, like a wolf group, a few jumps jumped to the tree of life, then Quickly climbing up, in the twinkling of an eye, there are thousands of different guardian elves on the tree of life. These mutated guardian elves have opened their mouths, and their mouths are like demonic mouths. They go down. The sawdust flies, and the thick and hard bark of the tree of life forever can't stop their foraging. In the twinkling of an eye, it is all pitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of being eaten by the foraging, let the tree of life continue to send out the stern trombone, the sound of the call is far away, let the 茫茫林海 tremble, life Under the tree, the surviving eternal night elves are dying in blood. There are many elite warriors among them, but the mutated guardian elves also have the same strength. From time to time, the eternal night elves are thrown out of the front line, and then those wild animal-like variations The guardian elves will swarm up, and in a twinkling of an eye will turn the eternal night elf into a white bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more mutated guardian elves emerging from the forest. The tens of thousands of guardian elves are like a large group of locusts, madly eating around the tree of life. Don't let go of even a leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Lichao’s face sinks into the water, and he said with a plain voice: “Let’s go.” It’s no longer the direction, continue to the base city. Going, the three strong night elves' strongmen followed, and the sky above the forest, constantly echoing the strange whistling, sounds like the wind, but everyone can feel the pain that cannot be described in the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
