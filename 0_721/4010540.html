			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last time I went to Green Forest, it’s been a while, Richard There is something that can't adapt to the style of the tree of life. It takes a while to react. This is the character of the tree of life. Just don't start to go to an extreme, and the tree of life immediately realizes its own state of affairs and immediately puts on a pair. A calm and solemn voice, said: "The great master, I have already prepared everything for the promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to encounter this time? Natural enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are usually three kinds of wood ants, crypt spiders and crows, but I think the world tree is intentionally targeting me. In this case, there may be hunting for dwarves and beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life says, while sending messages, it’s about life. The tree of life is of great dedication. It not only attaches descriptions of various natural enemies, but also includes image data from various angles. Ants are about half a meter long and are extremely fierce giant ants. A group of thousands of them often live in places that are rare in the forest. Crypt spiders like to dig underground. These can be reached. Two or three meters of behemoths are often able to dig up a complex network of complex passages. The crows are no different from the previous ones. These three species are natural enemies of the tree of life and constitute a three-dimensional attack, from the crown to the trunk to the root of the tree. Let go, the last failure of the life tree may also survive under the shovel of the crow, but this time the failure of the promotion will inevitably destroy, the crypt spider will not let the delicious roots of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal life tree wants to be promoted. At this time, the elves must be quite strong, at least there are thousands of people, and the warriors of the middle ages. There are four or five hundred people, of which there are about ten strong people in the sanctuary, so that it is possible to block the natural enemies that rush like the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these three natural enemies rely on instinctive attacks, but the last two natural enemies listed in the tree of life are the same intelligent race as humans, hunting for dwarves is A dwarf tribe with a height of less than one meter, a large head occupies one-third of the whole body. They look funny, but they are extremely ferocious. Their recipes are extremely broad, Green Forest Almost anything can be eaten. When you are hungry, even the rock can eat. The predator dwarves have the original tribal form. In addition to the soldiers and sacrifices in the tribe, you can use the power of a few ancestors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting dwarves are arguably very likely to be the king of the forest, but their greatest enemy is actually the forest will. Under the suppression of the forest will, the life of the predator dwarf is greatly shortened, and the fertility is also very low, otherwise they It has already covered the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most dangerous is the reincarnation tribe, which is the mysterious tribe that emerges when the tree of life goes from mature to full body. They are gone, usually Even the tree of life has never seen them, and the images transmitted to Richard are second-hand information obtained from other tree of life, and it is only a rather vague silhouette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the reincarnation tribe are up to three meters long, with long legs and long jumps in the forest. They can manipulate the natural enemies of any tree of life. For example, a deserted beast becomes an army capable of good warfare. Each adult of the reincarnation tribe has the strength of the sanctuary, and the forest is their natural home. The power gained is far above the guardian spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this information, Richard knows that the original tree that protects the tribe of life tree is not to be a mature body for another three hundred years, but is invested in After Richard’s death, the tree of life can be promoted twice in less than ten years. This should be an extremely rare record in the history of Greensen. Of course, the price is extremely heavy. Now the tree of life is almost at all. The opposite of the same family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard pondered for a moment and responded: "I need some time to prepare. It may take three months to six months or so, maybe one year."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life immediately replied: "It’s so wonderful, master, you can rest assured that one year is for me, it’s the equivalent of a human being.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lucerne Sea, several people continue to go deep, and now it is already different from when they first entered Green Forest. At that time, the son of the forest almost killed Li by one force. If you look at the majority of the team, if you come back to a forest son, I am afraid that it will not last ten minutes under the siege of Richard and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the team is Tiramisu. The spacing of the trees is a bit narrow for the ogre lord. He occasionally needs to be sideways. The body can pass through the trunk. On the way, the two heads of the ogre kept complaining. The most topic was that the greens could not find any food, and this kind of yin and tide, forever The days when the sun was not seen also made the ogre depressed. He felt that he had grown mushrooms all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Haizhong naturally has all sorts of powerful poisonous insects, but it has been shocked by the breath of everyone. All of them are hidden. A few of the slap-sized drug scorpions that attacked the dead have just landed on the ogre's belly, and the result is the ogre skin. When it trembled, it was all shocked to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu, Twilight, Splash, Richard and the mountains and the sea, plus a unicorn, is the whole of this unit, they walk through The speed is so fast that one day begins to feel the oppression of the forest will, which means that the base city has been more than two hundred kilometers, the dark forest is now more dim, the night of the green forest is about to come, Richard decided to In the forest camp, anyone in the squad has a very strong will, and basically can ignore the suppression of the will of the forest. The sacred killer brought by Neris could not resist for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ready-made camp in Linhai, Tiramisu has ten tons of wheels, and dozens of giant trees have been cut off, and a layer of tree trunks has been laid on the ground. The floor and stumps are cleaned up with the legends or artifacts of the elf long knife, the sacred killing and the perpetual guide. From the perspective of equipment, this is an unprecedented logging of the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hundred square meters of open space in the forest, and Richard untied a box with space function from the back of the unicorn. Eight small pits were dug around the camp. Some dark powder was poured out of the box into the pit. It was almost filled up. Then Lee popped eight small fireballs and fell into the pit, those black. The powder immediately burned violently, squirting a fire column nearly two meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ogre Lord was very curious to come over and asked: "Head, what is this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our campfire." Richard replied. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powders are ground with the addition of a double combustion improver. The resulting flame is strong and long lasting. Eight fire pillars surround the camp and radiate The heat just covered the entire camp. The powder poured into each pit by Richard was about half a kilogram, but the pillar of fire was stable, as if it could burn forever. The curiosity of the ogre was stronger. "Hey, let's put a little bit, how long it can burn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough tomorrow morning." Richard is not particularly sure, he It is not just beginning to use this fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu looked at the bright flame and suddenly silenced. After a while, he said, "It’s a good thing, if our tribe could have it at the beginning. , you can move to the north, in that case, you may be able to avoid that extinction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
