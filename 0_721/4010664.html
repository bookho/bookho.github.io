			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but since the indefinite public call for Richard is her little lover After the words, the legendary Master who has never been afraid of the day has suddenly become somewhat shy in matters related to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fate night of the year, she was able to praise the left and right without any interest, but I don’t know why, I just heard that I could use it in a certain tone. Suddenly, Su Hailun suddenly had the urge to disguise and deny it. This is not true. Isn't it, but when does the legendary mage need to explain what he has done to others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it, or decided to reluctantly throw the initials into the lab. The cost of this treatment is hundreds of thousands of gold coins. At the beginning, it’s no big deal to wait a month. It’s really unnecessary to spend such a high price. For the legendary mage who has always loved money, this huge sum of money really has to be painful to spend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Su Hailun did not know that, in this way, her behavior was abnormal, so in the eyes of the minded person, she and she were more realistic. Intimate relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun suddenly raised his eyebrows and saw a small group of shadows that Lee’s eyebrows could not circling. It was not an ordinary shadow, but a shadow creature. Our projections in this world, apparently, the coordinates of Richard began to reappear in the vision of the shadow creatures, a large number of shadow creatures are gathering somewhere in the sky, and will soon complete the assembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage reached out and touched a little star on the fingertips and sent it to the shadow of the group at the heart of the eyebrows. The starburst instantly burned and spurted out. A one-meter-long flame burned the shadow of the group, and then Su Helun waved a large number of stars, sprinkled on Richard, and gradually integrated into Richard's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the void in the plane outside, the large group of shadowed regiments suddenly had a commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the lighthouse was inexplicably activated, the active open channel led a super army, but then a very vast and powerful force smoothed the portal, resulting in The void in this head also bursts several armies, and the coordinates that have been looming in the shadow world have disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after a long period of time, I have finally re-exposed the landmark lighthouse, once again hidden from their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun looked at Richard, who was still asleep, with a faint glimpse in his eyes, and turned away from the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, Su Hailun called the gray dwarf to an office that was temporarily opened, asking in detail about the expenses and operations of the dark blue during this period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, during the long and slumber of the accident, the business of Deep Blue was exceptionally good, the key of which was the nearly 10 million gold coins that Richard injects in advance. With this funding as the source, Richard launched a large number of research projects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small part of these projects have begun to enter the harvest period, of which there have been three quite successful projects, one is Iwate booster and the other is an enhanced version. The dwarf gunpowder, the third is the technology of low-temperature smelting of high carbon steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two have been put into mass production, and the order from Archimonde is more than 500,000 gold coins. This is the production capacity of the Deep Blue affiliated workshop. Not enough, otherwise the number will be huge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item can significantly reduce the cost of high-carbon steel, while at the same time can increase production by about 20%, in the Noland, where war supplies are not sold at all, improve The significance of production is even more important. This technology has been used in the dark blue, as well as in the weapons workshop jointly established by Nolan and Richard. Now it is the dark blue and the high carbon steel produced by Archimonde itself. Ten thousand tons, this is enough to fully arm the output of the 100,000 army. In the ordinary military equipment, high carbon steel is still a high-end material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage looks at the progress of the projects funded by Richard, very serious, this is the whole afternoon, when the last one of the book is closed Page, the legendary Master picked up the formula of the enhanced version of the dwarf gunpowder, carefully looked at it, and stroked it in the air. After about half an hour, she took a piece of paper and brushed down three new recipes, saying: These three formulas are tested and should be improved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf looks happy, holding the formula carefully, if he gets the treasure, he is The big magister, but the nature of the dwarf's love of metal and gunpowder will not change, or he will not make a musket that can be fired. If it is not developed an enhanced version of the dwarf gunpowder, the black gold gun will not. There will be enough power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle last night, the musket has proved its firepower. It may not be enough to deal with vain, but if it is in the effective distance, it will be enough to crush them seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the legendary Master’s formula is effective, then the gray dwarf’s gun power will be even stronger. Black Gold has planned to build a few more, and the fare increase is sold to the Dark Blue. Instructors, for the relatively weak body of the great mentors, this musket is a close weapon, the magician is a sharp war machine, but it is never the darling of the duel field, the self-defense stuff is not too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that it costs up to 100,000 gold coins in direct costs, and then counts the time that Black Gold builds it by hand. Even if it sells 150,000 yuan, it is not necessarily the case. What kind of money can be earned, only if you sell more than 200,000, you can make a profit. This price has already surpassed the general epic equipment, and the big magician can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black gold was sent, Su Hailun suddenly had an inexplicable fluster, so he couldn’t help but stand up and walk around, not knowing where he wanted to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she found out that she had come to the laboratory where Richard was being treated, and Richard was still asleep, in the perception of the legendary mage, I can feel the strong pulsation of the three hearts in his body, which suddenly made Su Hailun feel peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hearts of Richard, have the potential to step into the legend, and in the battle with the turbidity, Richard also showed the use of regular power Signs, although his use of the rules in the eyes of the legendary Master is still insignificant, but significant, which means that Richard has embarked on the right path, the legendary door, has opened half of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to walk into the legend means that Richard has eliminated the last obstacle to the sect, and the sect is still unable to mend Su Hailun. Deep blue sighs, but after all, you can see a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard’s body is still young, and the power of life’s rapids maintains his body’s vitality. However, his demeanor is different and he has taken off his former Qing dynasty, became firm and calm, and finally he and the turbid flow between the playful fight, but let Su Hailun think of a long-lost face, Gordon, the king of Akmond lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s small hand stretched out and wanted to touch the wound that had not healed in the chest and abdomen. From this battle, it can be seen from the side. What kind of life has passed in the past will make such tremendous progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her hand just reached halfway and it was lightly collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old elf mage who was still busy was shocked, and hurriedly lowered his head and pretended not to see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other container, the breath is stable at the beginning, as if it has not yet woken up, but his breathing is too regular, although he has deliberately kept a little messy. The rhythm, but listening to the legendary Master's ear, immediately restored to a formula that is not too complicated, at the beginning of the level, that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun snorted and left the lab. He opened his eyes quietly at the beginning and his face was bleak. He knew the temperament of the legendary mage and knew about the future. I am afraid that there will be no good days, and it may be the right way to leave Noland as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, thinking about what happened these days is a special experience in the long years. When he enters the past, he has been dark blue. Resonating to pull back to Noland, this is already psychologically prepared, will lose the progress made in the previous period, but now I find that not only did not fall into the realm, but the rules of touch have looming signs of breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, Richard is quietly asleep, the body runs on its own, constantly absorbing the rich free energy around it, and the body is reconfiguring bit by bit, magic It is becoming more solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a small amount of residual power of the war madman. This ability pushes Richard Johnson into the legendary realm, although there is no corresponding special ability, but actually let Richard Feel the realm of the legendary strongman in advance. The value of this aspect is totally unpredictable. Just like the potion of inflammation, you can experience the power form of the higher stage in advance, especially across key realms. It’s bigger than it looks, so there will be fewer obstacles in the future when it’s promoted to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary path of each strong is different, most of the strong can not cross the legendary pass, because it costs too much to explore their own roads The time is so inaccessible to the realm of comprehension rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s mood really relaxed, and the fatigue and injuries accumulated over many days also broke out in the first place, and then they were patched one by one. Under the circumstances, Archimonde's blood has entered a state of slumber, but the blood of the elves has grown vigorously and absorbed energy. The well water of the wells of the stars began to rise slowly, and several sparkling stars appeared in the well water. The real name of Richard, Salong, is also looming, and after the original real name, it seems that there are new symbols of the gods to emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
