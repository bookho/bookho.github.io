			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard only met with Ellie, and didn’t even talk After a few words, I can’t talk about it at all. Don't talk about your partner, even if you just want to help each other, you don't know where to start. Faschi’s attitude is also unpredictable. He suddenly respects Richard and is cynical, which makes him unable to grasp the true intentions of Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinkingly, Richard suddenly touched the three crystal slabs in his pocket, hard and strong, and some uncomfortable. He remembered that the sands have said that these three things claim to be able to solve all the difficulties encountered, so it should not be difficult to solve this small thing in front of you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard put his hand into the pocket and shredded a piece of crystal slate. Crystal fragments instantly become pure energy, flowing from his fingertips into the body. In the consciousness of Richard, there is such a paragraph: "For you, Alice is a natural ally and a unique companion, not to be missed. But you are the same for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton was shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the prophecy is not so powerful, but it should not have this effect! This is beyond the scope of magic, but the grasp of the human heart, the situation and the soul. This sentence, if it is from the mouth of Gotton, is not surprising. However, it is the result of the power released by the crystal slate, which is shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s rich knowledge, it’s not clear which spells have such magical effects. In this way alone, magic is almost omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very simple, but it is very crucial. Many people who are in a puzzled situation just need to point in the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has clearly understood how to grasp the relationship with Ellie. The partner is just attached, and he is more interested in a solid covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shock, Richard’s hand in his pocket shook, and he accidentally crushed a piece of crystal slate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another passage in his consciousness: "The knight is the cornerstone of all wars. This is a sharp double-edged sword. Don't let They cut into yourself. So their most important quality is loyalty, not potential. More knights are necessary, even if they only need more porters to go to the Faro plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha was shocked again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this sentence is equally significant. It not only solves this choice, but also points out the principles for future treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction is precious and limited, and the number of people who build the knight is hundreds of times the number of structures. Ten levels plus enough talent and carrying capacity can become a knight, and the potential of this kind of thing, at least for the current Richard, the upper limit is fifteen or seventeen is no different. What he needs is the army's backbone that can provide immediate combat and loyalty, not Elvin, a young talent who can betray at any time. It is useful to talk about potential, to live or to be in your own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two crystal slate can be said to solve the two problems that Richard is currently facing. His hand trembled and touched the third crystal slate. Richard immediately started to be shocked. He took his hand back like an electric shock, but he accidentally shattered the third crystal slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sand says, these three crystal slate really have magical power. Richard has already used two pieces, so the third piece should be preserved anyway. If there is no dead end in the future, this is the hope of saving lives! Although the quick sand gives him a crystal slate, although it is understated, it does not mean that this is not a rare thing, nor does it mean that it can be continuously obtained. Maybe there are only three such crystal slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the last piece of crystal slate out of his pocket and carefully wrapped it in a square towel made of sneak woven cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing some strange behaviors of Richard, Faschi couldn’t help but curiously ask: "What good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to tell the truth: "A fate amulet, very precious, crushed when necessary, will have the power to reverse the fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing that Richard was serious and serious, Faschi smirked and thought about this kind of thing? If there is one, many big people can not die. She only said that Richard had a cold joke, and wanted to use this action to delay the time of the answer in order to make a more thoughtful decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many big people have similar negotiating skills. Faschi is not in a hurry to get an answer a few minutes or a few minutes late. At present, Richard's situation does not allow him to have too many choices, so she will certainly be able to get enough good conditions for Alize. In her opinion, the bottom line that Ellie’s adults confess is really too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Richard wants. He knows that if you tell the truth, Faschi will never believe it. In fact, just a few minutes ago, even he himself did not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deepening of Richard and the idea was fixed. He first took out the small box containing ten high-purity magic crystals and handed it to Faschi, saying, "This is the gift I gave to Count Earl, and it is our agreed deposit." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi opened the small box and looked at it, saying: "Ten high-purity magic crystals! Great handwriting, but it seems that it is not enough. This money only It is enough to equip an ordinary second-order knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is enough sincerity," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are talking about the second-order knight, of course, it is better to be a knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He raised his hand and interrupted Fasqi’s words and said, "Okay, our time is very limited. There is no need to waste time on bargaining. This is my bottom line. Acceptance or not should be The Earl decides, not you! Of course, if the Earl is instructed by you, and you feel that the sincerity is not enough, then the so-called agreement will stop here. As for these high-purity magic crystals, it is your maintenance of my brothers and sisters. Thank you for your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi sighed, and some reluctantly took the magic crystal box and said: "Small gas is not a "The character that a man deserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In contrast, the impossibility of extravagance is even worse," Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi snorted and said: "The value of Earl's adults can be more than twenty second-order knights!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he agreed, and then said: "The Earl adults want their allies to be strong and powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
