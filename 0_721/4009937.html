			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the giant axe, Baron Fontaine bounced from the ground. His face was pale, and the eyes of the fire-breathing glared at the leader of the town bear knight under the city, slamming his right hand and extending three fingers. This is the command he wants to launch a magical machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gesture of Baron Fontaine, screaming: "Three is not enough, all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The baron hesitated a little, but still held his hand into a fist. Then the air rang the sound of tearing open the air when the plane was launched. Four enchanted arrows followed the three shots in front, and the arc was automatically drawn, and the trajectory was shot to the bear of the town bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchantment arrow is extremely fast, and the first three arrows are sent first, almost to catch the heavy axe that spins back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader reached out and took the flying axe easily from the air, and calmly turned to the enchanting arrow. Just then, a scream of Sinclair suddenly sounded behind him: "Dodge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the face of the low-level indigenous, even the city defense The leader of the town bear knight also has no retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the roar of thunder, he waved a heavy axe and smashed the three enchanted arrows with unimaginable skill and speed. The huge impact brought by the enchanted arrow also makes the huge body of the town bear knight leader shake, and the konjac is constantly going backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the remaining four arrows have been closely followed. If the town bear knight leader jumps off in time, then it is too late to escape, but the ride will definitely be shot. Just right. According to the heavy blows that have just been received, even the strengthened armored konjac is inevitably pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader can still pick up the remaining four enchanted arrows, so he raises the heavy axe and falls without thinking, degrading an enchanted arrow After that, he traversed another arrow that shot at the konjac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, the leader of the town bear knight suddenly flashed a layer of light gray magic light, so the heavy axe in his hand immediately became much heavy. Not only does the speed of wielding decrease, but even control becomes difficult. The heavy axe is so strong that it is attached to the konjac arrow, but it is unable to fall it, but can barely let it fall. This enchanted arrow, which could have penetrated the konjac, now turns into the abdomen of the konjac, and opens a deep wound in the position of the konjac horse's belly, and even reveals the visceral internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac screams and screams. The leader of the town bear knight who lost control of the mount rider slammed the axe to the remaining two enchanted arrows. But this time he finally confirmed that the reason why the heavy axe became uncontrollable was that his strength was greatly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that magic just a weakness? The idea of ​​the town bear knight leader has passed through such an idea. Then the heavy axe in his hand finally flew out under the impact of the enchanted arrow. Two enchanted arrows were shot into his rib side, and the other hole was worn by the konjac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader unwillingly made a noise, the body swayed a few times, and finally fell to the ground. The wound on the side of the rib has a size of a basin, and the arrow is deeply penetrated into the body of the leader of the bear of the town, almost revealing from the other side. The powerful magical power attached to the arrow has completely shaken the fragile internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight leader can no longer stand up, from the arrow to the falling horse, he has been cursing the opponent's luck. The town bear knights all have good magic resistance, and negative spells like the four-level magical weakness have only a small probability to play a role in them. The leader of the town bear knight itself is up to the 14th level, and the combat power and the konjac combat power are equivalent to the 16th-level sanctuary. But the weak technique took effect on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
