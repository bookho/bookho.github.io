			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of everyone, Naiyou finally unveiled Richard’s chest The clothes, on his body, also have more than a dozen deep holes, but everyone is staring at Richard's heart and wants to see how much the injury there is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is the cornerstone of a strong person. The stronger the strong, the stronger the heart will be, and even more than one heart will grow, regardless of the heart. The number of the original, the original and the most original heart is always the most important. In front of a powerful priest, no injury can not be cured, but if the heart is damaged, even if it is cured by the gods, it will affect this. The strength of the strong future, and the injury of Richard, is right in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naiyou finally opened the clothes of Richard and exposed his heart, and immediately whispered, and people could hardly believe it. His own eyes, on Richard's chest, are lying on a crystal clear crystal plate, which is the last piece of fat crystal plate, just blocking the dead light that hits Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh around the fate of the crystal plate is black, showing how strong the dead light is, that is, the aftermath can cause such an injury, but anyway, Richard The heart is finally saved. As long as a few magical techniques, Richard can restore the consciousness of the mind. Seeing here, the followers immediately burst into a repressed cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, including Achilles, the four great priests were silent, and finally asked the sands: "Neilou, able to resurrect Na."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero is now 18, her resurrection power has improved, but it is not perfect resurrection, the upper limit of the resurrection Still suffering, Lina is not a talented person. Now she is already a 19th grade. After the resurrection, she is likely to have no hope for life. As a great magician who has already seen the legendary threshold, this is actually an incomparable one. The cruel ending, there is no mediocrity in the presence of the people, even if it is not a sanctuary, but also like Richard, deliberately suppressing his own strength, so they can understand Lina's mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lina is in front of Richard, it takes courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai’s hand was placed on Lina’s forehead, silent, but did not answer the question of quicksand, her sudden silence, let everyone calm down, The heart is like a huge lead stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the sand is urging a voice: "Nai You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what the ending is an ending, it will be faced sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie You took back his hand and sighed and said, "Sorry, I am a big man, I... there is no way to resurrect her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is tantamount to a thunder, and all people are shocked at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way to resurrect," the sound of the sand can not help but improve a few degrees, and then asked: "I did not see you used the resurrection ability, do not Because other things have affected your judgment, Naiyou, Resurrection Lina, this is the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina has a special affection for Richard, there are already many people watching Come out, perhaps it is not clear that only Richard and Lina are the two parties. The sands know that the origins and ambitions of Naiyou are even deeper than those of Io, for fear that she would not be able to resurrect Lina because she thought she had cut off her rivals. Therefore, the tone becomes extremely tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Naiyou raised his head and said with a smile: "I did not use the resurrection ability, but the current state of Lina is not resurrected, the light beam has The ability to directly destroy the soul, in fact, the soul of Lina is now near the edge of complete destruction, simply can not be resurrected, even if I forcibly resurrect her, it is just a soulless walking dead, I believe that Lina is also Never want to live in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That Richard." The sound of the sand was a bit low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the beam to destroy the soul is mostly endured by Lina, and the soul of Richard may be slightly damaged, but the impact should be small, at most There are some changes in personality after waking up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can you do now." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou said: "I can maintain the soul of Lina for a while, so that she can wake up and give a confession, this time will not be very Long, roughly only a few minutes, the longest will not exceed one minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not answer immediately, but silent for a few seconds before saying:" Io, immediately healed Richard, let him wake up, Naiyou, you also wake Lina, and then set up a camp, let them get together for a while, I think, they may have something to say."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nye and Io both nodded, and each made their own efforts. In the twinkling of an eye, Richard and Lina had already woke up, and at this time a camp had already been set up and covered on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai 跪 跪 sitting in front of two people, said with a blank expression: "Licha, Lina adults, you only have less than ten minutes, the exact point It’s said that it’s less than ten minutes for Lina. This is the limit of my ability. If you want to say something, hurry and talk, don’t hesitate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Naiyou turned out of the camp, and carefully placed the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the camp, the followers and the knights are deliberately keeping a distance from the camp. They either stand or sit and have different postures, thinking about their own Nothing, no one speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knight of Blood is the furthest away. She sits on a snowy rock and feels that Hulan’s winter is so cold for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, Richard instantly recalled the things before the coma, and he took care of Nai’s words, and suddenly he was cold, because he already understood Nai. The meaning of the secluded words, while Lina seems calm and calm, this ending has long been expected in her, and even some surprises, because she did not expect to get an extra few minutes, and Richard alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina, you...what can you do?" Richard used habitually in a reproachful tone, but he could hear the sound. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master held down Richard’s mouth and did not let him say it. She looked at Richard, her eyes full of struggle and hesitation, said softly "Reach, don't say this, my time is running out. Let me talk about it. In fact, there is a sentence that I always wanted to say. There is another problem that I always wanted to ask you. At this time, Let me be more self-willed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard nodded, Long Master’s face smiled, then a layer of fainting, whispered : "Actually, what I want to say is... is... ah, or ask your question first, no, or... or let me say that..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;####################################################################################################### ... suddenly it is very sleepy, let me lean on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s head leaned over to Richard, and Richard reached out and she leaned on Richard’s shoulder, and then stopped speaking. She only heard her slightly even breathing in the camp. Set to be warm, Richard secretly counted her breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three... Then, the camp is completely quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Lina." Richard whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Lena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not call her name again, just hugged her tightly, tears silently slipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a talented big magician, with wisdom that matches the big magister, is a charming woman, but in some things, She is smart, but not smart, because she is always insisting, insisting on what she likes, never compromised. In this sentence, she once wanted to tell Gotton that she wants to say to Richard now, but However, there are always reasons for this, so that she can not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end, she has not been able to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a deep and hot thing, she only hoped that Richard could understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, this is Lina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain of the camp was finally opened, and Richard crossed Lina and walked out of the camp. All the followers stood up and watched silently. Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around for a week and said lowly: "I have nothing, but Lina... she has left us forever, but now it is not our sadness. At that time, pass my orders, give up cleaning the battlefield, and all the enemies who are still resisting will be executed. The entire army will attack the holy city immediately. I want Lina to see how we took the holy city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers were silent and returned to their respective positions. The killing and screams on the battlefield suddenly became intense, and the last holy city warrior had been slaughtered. The army of Richard reorganized and became a neat queue, and began to enter the holy city. Because the elite warriors had already died, so the local soldiers of Shulan were now replaced with followers of Richard. The same is true of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
