			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding the current position, Richard looked at the time, it is seven o'clock at the moment Then, he said, "Well, at 11 o'clock in the evening, I will call all the generals. I will discuss the plan for attacking the Blue Camp tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little?” Viscount Heim felt that this time was wonderful. Isn’t this the time to rest and sleep? Don't rest well, how can you have a mental fight tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard nodded and said, "Eleven o'clock! In addition, Heim, you come over at half past eight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard immersed himself in the elimination of his dinner, a five-kilogram grilled wild boar ribs, and returned to the camp, began to think about the map. And his followers disappeared one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military camp quickly quieted down, except for the patrolling soldiers, others gradually entered their dreams. The war is imminent, even if the most unruly military squad is taking a serious rest, who does not care for his own life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He studied the map for a while, then looked at the time and simply went to bed. In his consciousness, the top view of the entire Blue Camp is showing up little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, the blue camp is full of bright lights, the heavily armed soldiers command a team of slaves, constantly moving the boulder sand Camp wall, reinforcement defense. At the same time, the large bundle of giant arrowheads was also taken out of the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-meter-long giant arrow is used for the city defense arrow tower, with a range of up to kilometers and a huge power. There are only four city defense giants in the entire blue camp, which are placed on the platform of the four corners. Now that the two giant pythons have just been installed, the other two are still in a tight assembly and will not be assembled until midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four giants were purchased by the Earl of Lambert and purchased at the Blue Camp. In addition to the ordinary arrow, each python also has two magic tracking 弩. The magic tracking arrow of each hundred thousand gold coins is what Lambert can't afford. If it were not for the Blue Camp, Lambert would not buy a city defense, but instead relied on the guards and slave warriors to resist possible attacks in the form of conventional warfare. In the land of blood, the magical giant is worth more than the human life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, no one in the entire Blue Camp camp noticed that a large number of bats flying in the night were mixed with a large number of extraordinarily large heterogeneous bats. A picture is passed through the soul link to Richard's consciousness and is spelled into a complete overhead picture. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside an already installed giant python, more than a dozen savage savage savage hands are waving their whip, commanding two heads up to four The adult ogre of the rice went to the wall. The ogres, with heavy hands and feet, roared from time to time fiercely, revealing long fangs. However, the consequence of their demonstration was to invite a whipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tamer’s hand, several imposing warriors are staring at the two ogres, who have thirteen strengths and broken hands. If the armored axe is picked up, it can break the ogre's bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final two ogres were caught up in the city and tied to a huge winch. Subsequently, the winch slowly turned under the push of two ogre and twenty barbarian slaves. Then an assembled city defense giant scorpion finally slammed and was slowly pulled out of a string of more than a dozen rhinoceros raw skeins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, seeing the ogres pulling out the city defense giants, rather than the city defense tools such as the rail steel doors, Richard was relieved. However, he immediately remembered the horrible cost of the rail steel door. Who would use this facility in the blood-stained area? This is something that will only exist in a giant city like Wangdu, or a military fortress that cannot be lost. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant python was placed on the downtime, and then, with a command, the entire city defense giant screamed and even the body bounced off the ground. The giant arrow plunged into the night like lightning and disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bat in the night sky flew, and the place where the giant arrow disappeared immediately flew, and after a while, the drop point of the arrow was found. The test shot got a range, which was as far as more than 1,200 meters! Such a range, let Richard also change color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With very few exceptions, no big magician can cast spells outside of this distance. If this configuration has enough tracking arrows, it can be said that It is the magician killer. Moreover, as long as you can afford the cost, you can also add the effect of the extended range, then you can kill the target two kilometers away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the city defense giants are expensive, most of the materials are used to increase the attack power, and there is almost no defense function. As long as it can directly hit the ontology, it is easy. Being destroyed into a pile of parts, from this point of view, it is much less troublesome than the magic tower. Otherwise, Richard really has to consider bypassing the Blue Camp. But leaving such a hostile camp in the rear of the crowd is not something that a somewhat minded commander will not do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Blue Camp, several gnomes rushed to the giant python and continued to calculate what, and then a gnome with a white beard jumped to the opportunity. At the beginning, he shouted and directed a team of soldiers to move the pieces of iron ingots and reinforce them on the base of the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomish?" Richard is a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are also intelligent races spread across many planes. They are not physically tall, and natural forces are flawed, but they are compensated by extraordinary wisdom and flexibility. Some people say that they are close relatives of dwarves, and others say that gnomes, like humans, are endangered native races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are natural alchemists and have a good magical talent. They are also natural candidates for assassins and killers. Richard has long known that there are also gnomes in the Faro plane, but it is said that the huge empire created by the gnomes is still in the direction of the west of the pale highlands, with the insurmountable dragons in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he saw a gnome in Faro. These city defense giants seem to be from the hands of the gnomes, no wonder the power is far above the ordinary giant python, and directly pursue the boutique of Noland. Richard can still remember that in the dark blue magic laboratory, the top alchemy equipment is from the gnome or the custom of the Elf Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These little things must be kept alive!" Richard immediately decided to hold these gnomes in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, at midnight, the last two city defense giants finally finished the test, and the Blue Camp gradually entered a dream. The detectives they sent have already determined the location of the Richards barracks. From the perspective of the distance between the two sides, the battle will start at noon tomorrow. But it is also possible that it will not trigger a war. After all, there is no direct conflict of interest between Count Lambert and Richard before today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Earl of Lambert, who is thousands of miles away, is taking a copper tube from the foot of a hawk, and taking out the information inside. Repeatedly read it several times, then walked to the study and looked at the topographic map of the blood-stained land hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
