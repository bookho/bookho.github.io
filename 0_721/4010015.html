As if it had been smoked. But he wiped his eyes with a square towel and it was fine. The nesting elite creature and Richard's soul link are all paid for by elite creatures. Even if the elite creatures are eliminated, Richard is at most a little discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elite bat was wiped out for the first time, which reminded Richard of the archer who killed himself. The guy's arrow skills are extremely powerful, far above the Oral, the magic arrow can range up to 800 meters, is the magician's nemesis. But most remote magic arrows use natural forces to track targets, while those with elves are sensitive to fluctuations in natural forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent’s cloth tonight is actually a serial killing. The real killing is when Richard receives a servant’s siege message and rushes to the remote. An arrow to kill. It was only unexpectedly calm and alert, and the team's total mobilization was not chaotic. He himself had an extraordinary perception of threats and natural forces, which avoided the killing of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too late for Luofu to appear, but Richard knows that he has had a hard time catching up with the killers. Even if it can catch up, it is useless. A sanctuary faces a fifteen-level killer, at least fourteen-level archers, and a dozen or so eleven-level killers, only to lose the way. If the other party is properly arranged, it is even possible to escape. There is no essential difference between the 16th and the 15th, and the 18th is different. Most of the legal and martial arts will awaken new powerful skills when they reach this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eyes of the elite bat before his death, Richard has already remembered the general characteristics of the killers. Although they have done a very professional camouflage, there are countless secrets of magic in the dark blue. After Richard’s magic progress in the future, there will always be ways to get them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard was standing in the tavern where the bloody battle took place. Behind him, all the followers silently watched the extremely bloody battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed fell to the ground, still maintaining an attacking posture before dying. He did not know how many wounds were in his huge body, and the internal organs flowed out. There was only one layer of skin left on the left forearm and attached to the upper arm. Two killer bodies were left in the pub, one of which was recessed into the chest and abdomen. Looking at the posture of death, it should be the last moment that the ogre directly hit his head with his head and flew him out. The broken ribs pierced the heart and lungs and became fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the ogres fell is still the gap in the wall. Those killers did step on his body before they could pass through here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly stood in front of the three-legged body and did not move. At this moment, heavy footsteps sounded behind him, and then Luofu sounded a little low and mellow: "Is this yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My followers." Check to correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a minor difference, but Richard sees this difference as important. The men are often temporary, and the followers will be with them for a long time. When the time is long enough, there are more meanings of brothers and partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luofu shrugged and said, "An ogres. But he is already very strong, it is a pity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is called a three-pointer." Richard said in this way euphemistically and firmly shows his attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-pointed, strange name." Luofu understood the meaning of Richard, just smiled and regarded this as a quirk that the Masters often have. He began to check the battle marks on the scene, but the more he checked his face, the more dignified, and the fierce battle scenes continued to be restored in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already learned about the general battle from the mouth of Oral, and as soon as he glances at it, all the details of the scene are engraved in his mind. Richard doesn't need to know too much about the process. He just wants to know who did it, and that's enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luofu looked at the injury on the three-pointer and said: "Look at these scars, it should be the hand of the black wing guy. This...oh, Seven-point cooked, actually can hold on the black wing for so long!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Wing?" Richard sharply captured the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Black Wing, the most terrible guy in Red Gosac, even more headaches than the two Sanctuaries. Although he only has fifteen But even if I am, I have to be very careful if I are stared at him. The guy and the shadow and the darkness are natural friends, and they can live in the dirtiest and damp places. And he is not alone, there is Nearly twenty killers of level 10 or above are for him to dispatch. You see, these two people are the men of the black wing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said : "His name is three-point cooked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, three-pointed..." Luofu had some helplessness. He has examined the entire battlefield and his heart is shocked. The ogre, called the three-pointed eater, was able to hold the black wing and his men for so long, and at least a hundred knives in his body were simply unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-winged scorpion scorpion venom is notorious. The wounds he caused not only hurt the bones, but also created the greatest pain. As long as you have a black wing and want to fight, it is equal to tearing your wound at the same time. For example, the three-legged left arm is almost completely torn in the fierce battle. How much will it take to endure such pain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Luofu did not think more, he attributed this to the ogres far beyond the human body and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene has been inspected, and Richard returns to Tiramisu and asks: "His body, what do you want to do?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu remained silent until Richard asked now and said in a low voice: "Give it to me, there are ancient traditions in our tribe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Richard nodded directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luo Fu also looked back, just took a deep look at the tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu did not notice Luo Fu’s gaze. In fact, his focus was only on three-pointed. He suddenly reached out to Gangde: "Let your axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde silently handed the giant axe to Tiramisu. Everyone thought that Tiramisu wanted to dismember the bodies of the two killers to vent their anger, and the cannibalist went to the body of the three-pointed body. He calmly looked at the horrible body of his twin brother, raised a huge axe, and forced the three-pointed head down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several human warriors exclaimed, and many of Richard’s followers were slightly discolored, not understanding the idea of ​​Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cannibal magician raised the head of the three-pointed hand and said in a low voice: "This is the head of my brother. As long as I eat it, its soul will settle in my body! And I will take it. The skull is decorated and always worn on the body. So when I kill the enemy, it will also see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weird custom, but heavy It’s so confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to a three-pointed, headless body and asked, "What about the body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How to deal with it. Our tribe's custom, if someone dies, will become the food of other people, or put it in the mountains, feeding the wolf and tiger leopard, as our feedback to nature." The eater magician said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Take him a magical flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard inspired the blood of Archimonde, extracting a little hot energy from it, mixed with the magic, and a dark red flame flew out of the hand, floating on the three-pointed body, banging A muffled sound, burning fiercely. This is a variant of the Hand of Fire. It is not a formal magic at all, but it becomes sticky and blazing because of the power of Akmon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the bodies of the two killers and said, "Sandru, these two will be handed over to you. I want them to die after "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. If you use it carefully, you can use it for a long time." The voice of the Undead Master is hoarse and low, always with the smoldering taste of the cemetery. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luofu’s face changed slightly, and the look at Richard’s eyes was different. Richard is too young and too handsome, always giving people the feeling of being dependent on the family background, so he tends to ignore the things he has done. In fact, Richard's current record, although not yet to the point of battle, but the battle, all have a brilliant record. The experience of killing on the battlefield alone, even many generals are not as good as him, and the individual powerhouses such as Luofu are far worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luofu has never given enough attention to this overly beautiful aristocratic kid, even though Richard’s teacher can provide magic items that he can’t refuse, but there is no Enhance the evaluation of Richard himself in his mind. In his not a long life, because he is a nobleman and a personal strong, he has encountered many geniuses like the comet rising and falling. Now that I saw Richard's unspeakable sultry, he raised his rating to a level, but he didn't think that a big magician of the eleventh level could threaten himself, maybe a few years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old saying in Faro: Levels are important, but not all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people learn the wisdom of the ancients, they often choose the part that they identify with. Therefore, this sentence is full of wisdom. People with high ranks see the first half of the sentence, and those with low ranks see the latter half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the tavern was swallowed up by the raging flames, and the bodies of the two killers were carried to the military camp on the site of Richard. Luo Fu and Richard also ride, it is escorted to Richard back to the hotel, so as not to have another accident on the road. A large part of the interests of the Sanctuary Swordsman has been tied to the young great magician, and the fragile magician should always be the key protection object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Luo Fu listened to Richard’s story about the three-pointed death and re-simulated the fierce battle in his mind, and then he was filled with emotion. Sighed: "I didn't expect an ogre to sacrifice himself for the cover of his comrades. It is not like an ogre." The adjective that the Sanctuary Swordsman originally wanted to use was brutal and stupid, just a temporary province. Feeling, it is hard to swallow it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
