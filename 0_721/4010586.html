			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to lie here for three months." Nolan gave a bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, there is no other way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, but that needs me Forcing you to destroy these cursing powers in your body, you know, this needs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee does not wait until Nolan finishes interrupting She: "I have to solve it in one day, what compensation do you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan is no longer entangled, directly put forward the conditions: "Two pieces three The structure is designed to be specially designed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but you have to accompany me to Greenson, I need a strong priest in this war." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan shook his head and said: "The priests of our eternal dragon temple are principled and will not interfere in the plane war."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "A fourth-order design I designed, you should know its value, and soon my assembly conference will be held. After that, the composition I made will be more Rare." Richard increased his stack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Nolan is very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyebrows suddenly appeared a time hourglass, falling on Richard, a lot of time sand immediately covered with Richard's body, huge god The power of pure time is washed away, and the last gray and black breath of Richard’s body is washed away in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan took a picture on Richard and said, "Okay, you can get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Richard’s turn to be shocked: “So fast.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan gave him a glance and said with hate: “As long as you are willing to spend God's grace, of course, is quick, how complicated you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan summoned a nearby officer and told her to take her scepter and robes, and then said to Richard: "I can be ready in ten minutes. When will we leave for Greenson?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s high efficiency once again shocked Richard, and he couldn’t help but ask: “Nolan’s great official, you just didn’t mean not interfering with the plane. Is war the principle of the eternal dragon temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan white took a look at Richard and calmly said: "That is the general principle, but the exchange of equivalents is The core rules of the Dragon Temple, the core rules are on the general principles, understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally understood, as long as the price is paid, the Eternal Dragon Hall Almost all of them are willing to do, in addition to selling the interests and dignity of the old dragon, but if the price paid is huge enough, Richard even suspects that the old dragon might sell himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a look at the body and found that he was faintly dying. He couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief and said, "You have to wait for a few people, we both After the hour, I will leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Nolan wants to ask unintentionally: "I heard that you owe a lot of equipment."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan frowned: "Then you dare to promise me a fourth-order construction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard smiled and said: "There are so many in anyway, don't care about owing one more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan temper: "You."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said: "It’s also a skill to owe, you think about it, what kind of people are willing to let me owe it first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan thought, I think it’s true that Richard’s words are correct. The fourth-order structure can be basically a legendary strongman or a wealthy family. Existence, they are all able to rest assured that Richard has nothing to worry about, but he does not know, other people think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the green forest of the forest, the twilight is not busy in the forest, her eyes will suddenly turn into brilliant red At this time, a violent spiritual fluctuation will emanate from her, tearing away the will of the surrounding forest, and then the mental power will condense as a gun, and spur it out to somewhere. Once this mental power breaks through the will of the forest, Twilight believes that the distant nest and Richard will know where they are, and she can also know where she is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two guardian elves on the first day of the deep forest, the twilight never saw the guardian elves again. The suppression of the forest will highlight it. When she realized that she was lost, she lost. The connection with Richard, the mother's nest and the water flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the twilight felt a little tired, so I leaned on a big tree and inserted my hand into the trunk. The old tree trembled. It seems to be extremely painful. Soon, its branches hang down softly. The leaves of the whole tree are dry and fall, and they fall and fall. It doesn't take long for a bunch of old trees to be completely withered, and the twilight The color of the skin has recovered a lot, and the skin has regained its luster. She has not used the ability to swallow it for a while. Now, after the mother's nest is remodulated, the phagocytosis of the twilight has been greatly enhanced, not only the powerful creatures can provide energy. Even the ancient tree can add strength to her. After absorbing the vitality of the ancient tree, the first thing in the twilight is to re-energize the spirit and tear the will of the surrounding forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is repeated, the consumption of color is huge, the consumption of forest will is even greater, and in the case of being unable to get rid of the will of the forest, the twilight is like this The way quickly consumes the energy of the forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret she has is that she has never seen the guardian elves. It seems that the guardian elves are afraid of her strength. They all hide, and when they think of it, the twilight can’t help but frown. , said to himself: "Does they know my ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what you think, at this moment, the color is not answered because she can't find it. The guardian elves, in the same way, at the other end of the distant forest, Tiramisu and the mountains and the sea have not seen the guardian elves for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre's tall body is walking in the forest, the heavy footsteps make the earth tremble, he obviously looks very annoying, always swaying giant Ten tons of hammer, stumbled a tree that was not pleasing to the eye, the forest was gloomy, the scenery around it looked exactly the same, there was no difference at all, the sky above the head was as dark as the peers would enter the night, not like the morning, in the forest It is the ultimate moisture, the water vapor is even thicker to the point of becoming a group of white fog, and it also contains a strong taste of rot leaves, this environment undoubtedly makes the ogre feel very uncomfortable, so the two heads are complaining, any A tree that looks thicker and more lively than its surrounding companions is the object of its anger. In the case of occasionally popping up a few camouflage trees, Tiramisu is even more enthusiastic about this. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason to make it so anxious is that many days have passed since the scheduled assembly date, and they are still lost in Lin Hai, Richard’s The troops must have already arrived at the Yongye tribe, and the sudden changes in the forest also show that the guardian elves are changing. At this moment, they are not on the battlefield, making the ogre become quite irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl sits on the shoulders of the ogre, holds her chin in her hand, and is thinking about her heart. She has been like this for so many days, and she has hardly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, when can we find the head." The ogre couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl shook her head and said, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we are so lost It’s not the way.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There will always be the way to find the road.” The barbarian girl said absently, and then added with absent-mindedness: “There is no Richard now. Find the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very simple, but the ogre feels a lot of meaning, his two heads start together, the more you think the more complicated, Silence for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the ogre suddenly said, "His Royal Highness, can you go down and walk for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains and walruses just awake as they woke up, jumped from the ogre, and the earth shook also violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked up at the ogre and said with some surprise: "It’s so tired again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu looked grievances, he looked at the iron bars on the girl's back, and then looked at the black arm on her left arm, the name of the iron bar is 11 tons, just stop. The arm armor looked unremarkable, but it was made by the mountain and the sea with Lafite iron. The weight was not much lighter than the iron rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, what if we have been looking for it, this damn forest will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then we will demolish the forest. Without the forest, there will be no forest will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, the ogre and the girl continue the forest Walking in the depths, there will always be old trees roaring down when passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenson's plane portal once again shines, and Richard returns to Greenson as scheduled, behind him, first of all Nolan and four eternal dragon temples The priests were then Neris, Agamemnon and Asiris, followed by a full set of 400 Knights and 20m from the Dark Blue Master, and then the elite Warriors of the Duke of the Iron and Blood family. Nyris's own private army, when all the troops had finished, the star appeared again. It took a while for the body of 100 meters to swim out of the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
