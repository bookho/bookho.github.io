			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating world is getting less calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a rapid increase in the topic of Archimonde recently, the main content is nothing more than two, one is the eternal dragon temple on the floating island of Akmend Protection will expire in January. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is that Richard’s time limit for the family council in the Black Rose Castle is only less than half a month, even if Richard is from the plane Out of a large army, the rest of the time is only barely enough for him to rush from the volcanic to the black rose castle, I want to attack the city, I am afraid that time is not enough, and the Black Rose Castle is the famous compound fortress castle of the League. Known as almost impossible to break, and historically Archimonde's enemies have stopped in front of the walls of Ashan, and have never witnessed this legend, so people are waiting to see how Richard will fulfill his promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the situation seems to be quite unfavorable to Richard, and near the Black Rose Castle, the army of Goliath and Sauron have signs of mobilization, although there is no Entering the territory of Gotton in the traditional sense, but at this moment, this transfer has an unusual meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came out of the Temple of Eternal Dragon, the news immediately spread throughout the floating world, not only because Richard is the main topic of the league’s politics at the moment, but also because He left the sacred unicorn, and it was the first time that Richard had ridiculed the sacred unicorn and swayed through the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, no amount of light fell on the door of the Eternal Dragon Temple, and more people who got the news were rushing in, people felt faintly, and for a long time. Richard seems to be breaking out on this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to go, he is interested in making people see more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, there are all followers, they are in different forms, in the eyes of the Nolanders, although they are not very high, All of them are full of murderous, obviously long-lasting battles, such people on the battlefield, and sometimes even more terrible than the inexperienced Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the followers, they are the elite elite knights of the team, their indifferent expressions, and the queues that are neat and nearly accurate when passing through the portal are even more eye-catching than the sophisticated and extravagant equipment. The elite rider of Baiqi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number almost suffocates those who quietly count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Nolanders, the qualities of these knights have clearly reached the level of the candidate knights, but there are three hundred rides, this horrible The number itself indicates the achievements of Richard in the development of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others began to quietly calculate the channel cost that these people need, Noland’s common sense, the Cavaliers have to pay double fees because people and horses It must be counted separately, then three hundred rides, even if calculated according to the transmission cost of the one-hundred ride, the one-way travel cost is three million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Faro’s time to obtain the Dragon Temple plane number is not long, even though Richard has made many sacrifices, but from the well-known probability, it is hardly It is possible to stabilize the plane channel to the extent that the unit toll cost is reduced to less than 10,000. If this is calculated, the transmission cost will be even more terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the three hundred squadron knights are not over. After them, there are knights who walk out of the eternal dragon hall. Compared with the elite squadron knights, they appear More humane, and at the same time the atmosphere is more fierce and powerful, Nolan's aristocrats will never be familiar with the knight's style, and immediately there will be people screaming: "Construct the knight."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the onlookers didn’t have much instigation at first, because Richard was a promising royal master, and the wild suit was the highlight of his first press conference. How could he kneel down? Construct the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these knights, many people nodded secretly, and as expected, Richard did hide the knight in the private plane. In these, these knights are obviously second-level suit knights, with the magical rides that have recently begun to sing the Holy Alliance, and the combat power can even surpass the construction of the ordinary third-order parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is only how much of the structure of the knight, ten rides, and even fifteen rides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ten-ride knight who walked out of the Eternal Dragon Hall, so some people’s smiles began to reluctantly, while others remained unpredictable. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen-ride rider came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiles of the latter group of people began to become stubborn, and the people in front did not laugh at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is also out on a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers to the twentieth ride, the crowd has begun to commotion, some people are excited, some people are pale, others are angry, more and more people get news, lead On the roads of the floating island of Archimonde, all the convenient observation sites have been occupied, and at this time, the powerful figures of the giants who are at the table of the tea table have also received news that they will naturally not be like ordinary people. It’s so exciting, but after sinking, the expressions are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa smashed the teacup in his hand and roared: "Is this demonstrating to me? Twenty rides, our Mensa is not yet Will be scared by the twenty-chief rider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers watched the blood flowing between the duke’s fingers, scared the whole body and trembled, no longer dare Say the latter half of the sentence, because when he flew back to report, Richard's costume knight only went out to twenty rides, and the back did not finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Peter Peter listened to the report of the attendant, silently for ten minutes, then screamed, tearing the followers of the news into pieces, letting blood Pour the viscera on your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Joseph is drinking tea with several old friends. After getting the news, his face changed a few times, but he finally said nothing, just continued to talk. The topic of politics and territory, but everyone seems to have a tacit understanding, no one to mention the name of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people, such as the Duke of Tucson, the Duke of Welling, are only telling their men to continue to observe, with a definite digital return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Philip, and stopped the meal. After thinking for ten minutes, he asked the nearest minister: “What do you think.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest minister was flattered and immediately thought hard. After a while, he took a step forward and said carefully: "The villain thought that Master Li is in the demonstration."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Philip took the paper towel and rubbed his oily fingers and said faintly: "Who will he show to him?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, Bear Peter, Mensa, these." Near the minister's head began to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Richard has enough power to intimidate the strength of the two families, why not directly launch the war, and the hatred between Richard and them is irresolvable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the sweat of the rain, thinking hard, and then daringly said: "Maybe... shocked the Wellingburg and Tucson families." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The near-minister seemed to be anxious to cry out. He lowered his head deeply and said, "The villain...I really don't know." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe suddenly sighed and said, "You should spend more time studying politics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nearly the whole body was shocked and said: "Your Majesty, this... I don't have to study politics. It is my responsibility to serve your daily diet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Philippe smiled, but there was no sense of perseverance, but it was very kind: "You have been with me for more than 20 years, and have been careful all these years. There is no need to prove your loyalty. I have a territory in the border area. The property is good, it is not safe. It is a territory that can be later supported by the Earl's title. I will transfer it to you. Take care of me for another year, then go to concentrate on developing the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The near minister is stunned, for a while The words are not going well: "This, villain... this can't be done..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you deserve. You have been with me these years. In addition to arranging recipes, many things have been abandoned. This year, it is a transition. As long as you are still with me, no one will dare to move your territory, but wait for you to go to your own territory. After I took office, I will not be able to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest minister suddenly squats and whispered: "Thank you, but what do you want when you want to eat? ”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe gently tapped the table, his eyes fell on the smashing colorful sky outside the window, and sighed: "Nothing, I just suddenly felt I don't need to be so fat anymore, maybe for so many years, it's just my own wishful thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
