			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard chose to increase the number of combat units and the strange eating speed. , range and energy reserves increase. The hens eat much more to create more combat units. As long as the mother nest is fed and there is enough time, Richard will have endless warriors. The reinforcement of the combat units is not in a hurry, and Richard is ready to think carefully before making a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the battlefield, the acid mist is much thinner. When Richard approached, the mother's nest began to breathe vigorously, sucking away the thin acid mist, revealing a hill-like body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment standing in front of the mother's nest, Richard has felt the invisible pressure. The mother's nest is a little strange. The color of the head and the shell is obviously new and old. It is a sign that has just grown. On the dark black carapace, there are still traces of lions and wind blades left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at his mother's nest and asked, "What are you looking for in such an eagerness?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is about the creation of special units, the master." The nest answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special Unit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, special units! They are produced only Occasionally, and need to consume divinity. You give my female killer the attributes of devil and death, she inspired the divinity I gained, and thus opened up the ability to create special units. But the creation process of special units can not let Anyone who saw it, including Miss Sands," said the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No sand? Why?" Richard was very surprised. The sand and the seeds are from the Eternal Dragon Temple. In Richard's understanding, they should belong to the same camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, just instinct to make me like this, except for you, it is best not to let anyone know, anyone!" The nest answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Richard nodded, waved a dark spell, shrouded himself and his mother's nest, and said, "Now can start." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest successively passed a large amount of information, and formed three options for the special unit form: human form, beast form, mount form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think about it, he chose the human form. He needs a strong and special warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hens then give three options: use all divinity to create a special unit, use half of the divine to create special units, and use one-third Divinity creates special units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current divine hoarding is roughly equivalent to the ancestor totem of fifteen small orc tribes, the minimum level of divinity needed to create a special unit. It is the ancestor totem of the five orc tribes. In the mother's nest information system, this lowest divine quantity is defined as a divinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly learned how to measure the hen's nest: "What is the difference between a special unit created with three divinities?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The combat power, potential, and special abilities must exceed one divine unit. If you create with a divine nature, you can get three special units." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create a special unit with three divinities." Richard immediately made the decision. He is not lacking in cannon fodder now, and the lack of is the strong. If there is no mother nest, the four hundred winds can not solve the lion. In the battle against Sinclair, almost all the resources were collected, and the tactical program implementation was almost perfect, and the result of such a tragic victory was obtained. If the place of the battle is not a castle, but a wilderness, there is almost no hope of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." After the mother's nest answered, silence for a moment, the voice continued to sound: "Now is the last choice, you can choose the current combat power Maximize; the second option is to maximize the potential, the future combat power will be more than the first, but you will get a new soldier, currently very weak. The last option is to increase special ability, because special The unit is inspired by Sinclair, so there are currently three special abilities, stealth, flash assault, and assassination. If you choose a special ability, your potential and combat effectiveness will be reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is the really difficult choice. Richard began to think seriously, and the wisdom of talents was fully activated, but the results were delayed. However, at this time, Sinclair’s volley was wiped out, and the scene that suddenly flashed in front of him appeared again in front of Richard. The fierce momentum of the one-shot kill will make Richard remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maximize your strength and attach all three special abilities!" Richard said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" The hesitation is now the mother's nest, and in its calculations, such a program does not get the most powerful combat power. But Richard is very determined. He almost used his life to experience the horror of Hinckler. In many cases, extreme characters such as Sinclair can be a terrible headache, much more terrible than a balanced fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it this way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish. Please wait a few minutes. "The mother's nest replied. Its abdomen began to violently agitate, and a moment after the giant oocysts of one person were discharged from the tail of the nest. As soon as it fell to the ground, it began to rhythmically shake. To the surprise of Richard, a knife blade was suddenly punctured from the oocysts and the egg wall was cut. When the blade cuts a few times, the egg wall is completely broken, and then a humanoid creature emerges from the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange creature with a well-proportioned body with a carapace-like carapace. However, the shell covering is very small, revealing a large piece of fine white skin like jade. It has a human face, very feminine and enchanting, but only half of it, the other half of the face is wrapped in a helmet-like carapace, the eyes are revealing dark red crystals. Its right hand is long and slender, with the hands of a human female, while the left hand is a metal blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the knife, the more familiar I saw, the more I finally realized that it was originally Sinclair’s short knife, swallowed by the mother’s nest, and finally created The special unit is integrated. The short knife has almost no luster, but there is always a heart-rending feeling when the eyes are watching. Richard threw a detection and found that it retains all the attributes, including the extraordinary armor and annihilation, which is a miracle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s gaze returned to the face of the new special unit, and I felt a little sluggish when I looked at it. As soon as it appeared, it gave Richard a feeling of incomparable familiarity, just as he had just seen it somewhere. In fact, when he saw the blade, Richard knew where the familiarity came from. If he didn't look at its appearance carefully, Richard would think that he saw Sinclair again! But its human half face and Xinkelel are only partially similar. Richard stared at it for a long time, only to find out why this face gave him such a strong familiar feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
