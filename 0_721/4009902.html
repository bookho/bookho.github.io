			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days and two nights passed, and Sinclair finally ended her carnival. Come out from the hall filled with the smell of sex and blood. Her body burned with a black flame, burning all the heavy dirt on the surface of the body. It is the fire of the ignorance that ignites the soul, with unimaginable power. The source of the fuel for the flame does not need to be explained. Just look at the body in the hall and you will know. Of course, the burning of the soul should have been a colorless flame, but it was only the endless darkness that was rendered by Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sinclair was dressed in armor, the two great magicians who had completed the work were standing aside. They did not evade her temptation, nor did they care to look at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great magician opened a map and said, "There are a lot of maps here, I have put important places on the blood-staining place." Mark it out, please take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair snorted and glanced at the map casually, and reached for an oasis sign, saying "There are many people here. Let's go here. How many warriors can we gather now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the surviving people, preliminary inventory There are about five hundred qualified fighters," said another great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair nodded and said, "Give each of them a weapon, an armor, um, half body armor is enough, let them go with me." Ah, no, there are too few five hundred people, and all the people who can move can send a weapon. We will set off tomorrow morning to attack the new oasis! Let them go first!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great magicians looked at each other, one of them said: "Adult, this kind of thing is done much, we will become the enemy of the entire plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! Are we coming to this plane to make friends with them?" Sinclair said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the meaning, adult! After all, this plane is not the secondary plane we were going to go, the power level of this plane is much higher. The legend is still a plane with legendary powers, no matter whether the legend is true or not. The number of gods we can now understand is also much larger than the predetermined plane. If we are captured by the plane, then... "The words of the great magician did not say the end, but the meaning is already very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Noland, the giants on each floating island have legendary powers, or at least the ability to balance the legendary powerhouse. But here is the new plane, not Noland. If you come to a legendary powerhouse, everyone has no possibility of living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary strong? The legend of the 18th level, just like the 'Sanctuary', is also the specialty of Faro! These guys are blowing their own skills. It’s awesome, and I don’t know where to hear it.” Sinclair said sarcastically, it’s nothing to be considered as one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great magician also persuaded: "Adults, our original purpose was to kill Richard, but now I am coming to a strange plane, this matter It can be put aside for a while. This plane is very mature, the resources are very rich, and it is very similar to Noland. So our current role is actually equivalent to the plane pioneer, as long as we can successfully return to Noland. Bringing the coordinates of the plane back is a great victory and success. The strength of the Bear Peter family will be greatly enhanced in the next few decades, and your position in the family will become important. As for the strongmen in the plane, we should not try to destroy them, but give them to the family's knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
