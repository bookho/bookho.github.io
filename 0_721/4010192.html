Among the young people of Faustian, Qi Qi’s reputation is much better than Nyris. In this respect, beauty always has an advantage. Although Nyris is a prince, before he was officially honoured, his identity was no more expensive than the core children of the giants. Therefore, the two people met in the past and they all spoke on an equal footing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Qi Qi suddenly appeared in the Greenson plane, and said hello to Nyris in a low courtesy, it’s no wonder that Nyris is difficult. adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nyris is a smart man with a good mind. He immediately understood the original reason, and Qi Qi must use the identity relationship with Richard as the benchmark to deal with the identity of Richard's partner Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qi Qi, how are you here?" Nyris was very curious, when Mensa performed the famous bet, he was present, but did not pay attention to it. Follow-up development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am now a maid and private life assistant for Richard." Qi Qi replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The maid and ... life assistant?" Nyris's head did not turn at all. He really couldn't connect the jewel of Mensa to the name of the fascinating Qiu Qi and the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the career assistant? It doesn't sound like a subdivision of a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Qi Qi is as light as water, no decoration, and the image of the past is simply different. Too big a contrast, let Nyris's brain sleep for a while. In the end, Qi Qi smiled and said: "It is actually a lover and an assistant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it turned out to be. Good career..." Nyris Habitually speaking, then found that the mouth is fast. He smiled very embarrassedly and said, "Sorry, but this is really unexpected! I still remember that you are a girl with great ideas and ambitions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi did not take it seriously, said with a smile: "Do you not think that my identity is easier to achieve my dream than to become a duchess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris eyes brightened, looked up and down at Qi Qi, praised: "You are very brave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞qi faintly: "Talk Not brave. It’s just that the opportunity is unexpectedly present, and I accidentally caught it. As for the price, no matter who it is paid, it will be paid sooner or later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris shook his head and said: "The people who can seize the opportunity are prepared, and where are the accidents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪浅笑I am not going to go on this issue, but say: "The adult is in the lab, are you going to see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese glanced at Qi Qi and said "There is no need to use respect for me, and the same is true for Agamemnon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a friend of Richard."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris smiled and said, "珞琪, I think from now on, you are also my friend. Unless you have different proposals?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi still did not respond, but faintly pointed to the laboratory door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Nyris entered the lab, Richard was standing in front of the lab bench and concentrating on drawing a frame. Neris knew that Richard should not be disturbed now, and he stood quietly. This is the first time he saw Richard draw the structure. After watching it for a while, his eyes were slightly changed. Richard’s hands were too stable and stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a line was finished, Richard changed the paint for the magic pen and said hello to Nyris, saying: "How are you interested today?" Is my lab coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! I can’t stand it! Nothing to do every day, staying in this damn place will make People are long grass! How long will we have to suffocate in the city?" Nyris suddenly burst out all these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "Why, this can't help it? Patience is a virtue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to his/milk/milk patience!" Neris vomited a foul mouth. When the four emperors burst into swearing, they always made people feel impulsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and repeated: "Patience is really a virtue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full two years of Luo’s face, the experience of stepping out of the desperate step by step made Richard understand the importance of patience. However, Nyris has not experienced so many setbacks. He has always been born with a halo, growing up in the aura, and continuing to create a career with his aura. He has everything now, that is, he will not have patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Nyres was ill-fated, a savage stance that wanted to tear his outfit, Richard only had to raise his hand and say, " Ok, let's go, tomorrow we will send troops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Nyris eyes brightened: "Directly the Elf Nest?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, go to cut trees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When living in the deserted Gobi on the bloody land, whenever When you see a small shade of wood, Richard feels that it is a gift from heaven, meaning a safe source of water and a relatively comfortable resting place. In the endless crimson, any piece of green is so delightful. After arriving at the Greenson plane, Richard realized that when the color of life is too strong, it will become a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, a team of heavily armed fighters lined up from the city gate and headed for a forest less than a hundred meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team's Chinese team's warriors are all big and round, with a huge axe, obviously some guys who are arrogant. On both sides, there is a row of reloaded warriors with hand-held tower shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in extremely humid weather, wearing a plate is wet and cool, very uncomfortable. However, no warrior dared to run around the city without wearing a plate. The elf's cold arrows are likely to be shot at any time, and the chain armor and the armor can't stop the elf's arrows, let alone the leather armor. The price of the armor that can block the arrow is at least ten times that of the plate. Even the generals are not necessarily equipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side of the team, Richard, Nyris and Agamemnon walked together. Richard looked relaxed and casual. Agamemnon was always a face without much expression, and Neri's delicate face was a black sigh, and the little mouth didn't know who to compete with in his heart. What is remarkable is his weapon. The four emperors did not take out the burning crystal-like sword this time. Instead, they changed the double-edged short-handed axe that had a greater difference from his appearance. Half a ton of weight, the black air above, a group of purple electric discs, which suddenly disappeared, is a legendary weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let Gangde see it, I don't know how much resentment will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde vs. Tomahawk, just like most men are like women, before they have no other choices, they are in their hands. Once there is a better appearance, you will want to change it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut tree is a kind of strength, especially in the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the command of the army officer, the soldiers dispersed around, and the axe of the axe stood under the tree and began logging. Each of the logging warriors is protected by two shielded warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees that were used by the indigenous elves to drive around the city, the wood is hard, the texture is very brittle, and it is very difficult to cut. . Due to the difficulty in cutting the appropriate interface, the cut cut surface is also directly split along the texture and cannot be used for construction. Often the soldiers went down and there was not a shallow groove on the trunk, but a pit was pulled out, and the fallen pieces were like rock pieces. This tree is called rock wood by the soldiers, and the degree of hatred is even above the indigenous elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A five-level fighter with plenty of strength and strength to cut down a few trees in a day. The trees that have been felled have little use except for being burned directly for fuel. This is the most stupid way, and the only way to force the forest to walk away. Whether it is Schumpeter, or later Gordon, it can only be consumed by the indigenous people. If you don't cut trees for half a month, then the forest will completely overwhelm the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was prepared for this time, and he specially brought a batch of broken wooden axe. The enchanting effect of these Tomahawks is entirely for cutting trees. In the past, only a few powerful warriors in a unit were equipped with such a giant axe, which was specially used to break the door and break the wall when attacking the castle camp. However, Richard is now rich in money and bought five hundred broken wooden axes in one go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the soldiers he brought with the local garrison of Green Forest, a total of four hundred soldiers who could use this broken wooden axe could not be selected. Richard waved his hand and told him that the extra broken wooden axe would be alternated instead of being shipped back to Noland. In the eyes of the Dragon Master, this is another hateful act of defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of the Nolans, a warrior with muscles around his neck took a deep breath and took a big step Axe, scream, squat on the trunk! The axe slammed into the trunk, which was several times deeper than the wound caused by the giant axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior was overjoyed, his voice was thunderous, the axe was like the wind, and in a few minutes, a giant tree that was hugged by one person collapsed! When the rock fell, the soldiers immediately burst into cheers. They dumped the backlog of anger for a long time on a rock and tree, and the buzzing sounds one after another. Under the broken wooden axe, a strain of rock and wood screamed and fell. The efficiency of clearing the forest has increased by dozens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the short beard and said triumphantly to the Dragon Master: "How? Or do I have a solution? This is called a career!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina glared at him and snorted, and the full chest was ups and downs. What is a good way to use a broken wooden axe? Of course, she knows that the broken wooden axe is easy to use, but this one is five hundred gold coins, and there are few places to get it. Noland can't find a few supplies, even the Xiong Peter family is also equipped. It’s just enough, there’s not enough inventory in the warehouse, and it’s not necessary to say it to Gotton. As for Lina, even the soldiers of the soldiers can't afford to pay, and there is still money to buy a broken wooden axe, and it is even more impossible to wave like a sharp wooden axe like Richard. The powerful warrior does not say anything. There are hundreds of surpluses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
