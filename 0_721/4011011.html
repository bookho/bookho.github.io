			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All areas that are ruled by the reaper no longer have any life, thoroughly It became a dead place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be seen criss-crossing gullies everywhere on the earth. These traces did not exist. They should be left after the reapers digging resources. The huge gully, which is hundreds of meters wide and hundreds of meters deep, is even stunned by Richard. It is the nest forest of the mother's nest, and there is no such remarkable destruction efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the last dark area on the magic map and immediately ordered all the beasts to advance to the area at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper has finally appeared, hundreds of miniature fighters chasing the flying beasts all over the sky, and these flying beasts try their best to dodge, no Hesitantly marched toward the core area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good-moving beast miraculously escaped the layers of the fighters and slammed into the core area, at the edge of the core area. There is a thin layer of mist, but this layer of fog can hinder the detection of all perceptions, and even the feelings of the Faro gods are blocked by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is very thin, the flying beast flies through the fog wall a few times, and then a behemoth appears in its field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a huge ship of up to a kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty high-energy beams shè, and instantly turned this flying beast into fly ash, in its last field of view, only the horrible hull of the giant ship There are also numerous numerous barrels on the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kacha, the table held by Richard’s hand was suddenly torn apart and turned into sawdust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and communicated with all the followers, calmly saying: "All preparations, the war will begin soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Richard sent the image of the reaper’s giant ship to all followers and said, “It’s mine, no one can grab me. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, no one was impassioned, no one was joking with Richard, and all followers were silently preparing for the battle. Everyone knew that the next battle would probably decide to die. In this way, in the almost coagulated atmosphere, the first reapers appeared on the horizon, and then became the endless black cháo, rolling in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even even Richard did not count how many reapers appeared, he only knows that as long as he tries to kill, keep killing, killing no reapers, then nature I won, if I didn’t kill the Reaper until the end, I lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third war with the Reaper, just started inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already appeared on the battlefield on the 1st. As always, the king of Archimonde is still standing at the forefront of the battle line, coming over the sky. Among the reapers, there is a huge black shadow that is particularly eye-catching, that is, the giant ship that the beast saw before he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star and the nest have the same or even larger size than the giant ship. Some legendary dragons are even bigger than this giant ship, but after all, It is life. In the eyes of Nolan's strong, no huge life will be amazed, but artificial creation can be so great that it is chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been two major battles with the Reaper, at this moment, the faces of countless warriors are still pale, just because they know the horror strength of the Reaper. It will be even more frightening because they don’t know how to deal with such a huge warship. The mechanical warfare can harvest life in pieces, and how fast the warship can harvest life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s voice spread throughout the No. 1 position with the help of magical power. He pointed at the giant sword and shouted: "That The big guy is mine, and the rest is for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole position was dead for a few seconds, then I don’t know who screamed with a hoarse voice: No problem, head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the tsunami-like shouts sounded on the entire position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get rid of those groceries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not dead. I will take a step back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the bloody soldiers, no longer talked, pulled up the holy sword, and strode to the enemy, he When you step down, it will stir the earth to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance that each step spans will be greater than the previous step. In the blink of an eye, his speed will increase to such an extent as wind and electricity. Among the reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard’s speed is starting to flash, and several flashes have reached depths of a kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the route he passed, the reapers within a few tens of meters suddenly lost control, shaking, and the land units began to rise to the sky, and the fighters just Like a drunken stunned turn, followed by a flesh-and-blood warrior and all kinds of fighters began to spurt the fire, and then burst into a ball of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge of the King of Akmon has embarked on a path of blood and fire in the reaper's camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went all the way deep, and had already rushed under the huge ship. He suddenly jumped up and suddenly flew kilometers and crossed the huge ship. Then, like the weight of 10,000 tons, it fell straight and squatted on top of the giant ship. With a loud bang, a huge cloud of fire ignited above the giant ship, and Richard disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of landslides and tsunami bursts across the position in Archimonde, the soldiers know that Richard has successfully rushed into the interior of the ship. Then, waiting for it to burn and explode, the reaper is powerful, but in the eyes of these strong, Richard is already a symbol of invincibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship slowly stopped, hovering in the sky, and constantly shaking, the rest of the reapers continued to move forward, and in the blink of an eye, they rushed to Akmen In front of De's position, the high-energy beam of the sky was mixed with powerful kinetic warheads, slamming on Archimonde's position like a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle broke out, a reaper such as cháo, like a cloud, the sky and the ground go hand in hand, instantly drowning the position of Archimonde, there is no front line With the rear, there are battlefields everywhere, and there are enemies everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard has already entered the inside of the giant ship, but suddenly found himself falling into a four-sided closed room, there are no doors and windows, no equipment, and some are only the light beam on each corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar, and the holy sword slid forward. The fan-shaped sword smashed the wall like a ruin, and smashed a dozen meters in front of him. Long passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the figure flashed to the end of the passage, there were several high-energy beams, and the room was still a closed space, the only entrance was Li Inspect the forcible walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard, there was a hint of ominous feeling. The holy sword suddenly stabbed down. First, the metal floor was pierced, and then the gushing sword gas blew open several layers. The partition, and under his feet, made a deep passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down all the way, and instantly reached the end of the passage. He was still greeted by a high-energy beam along the way. The end of the passage was still a sealed room. The entrance was The wall that was pierced, in fact, along the way, Richard was passing through a closed room that was blasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Richard suddenly heard the faint mechanical roar, and felt a little different energy flow, Richard’s heart, the sword immediately Sting in the direction of the roaring sound, once again pierced a passage, this time at the end of the passage is no longer a monotonous closed room, but a wider space, there is a strange machine is constantly Running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard, he moved to the space where the machine was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this space is much smaller than expected, about six closed rooms, this machine almost squeezes all the space, Richard puts his hand The mechanical outer casing carefully senses the structure and energy flow inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard’s hand was gently shaken. This machine was suddenly split and forced to be broken into large and small parts. In mechanical zhōng yāng, there is a The arm of the jīng thin power metal is barely exposed, and the powerful energy is constantly flowing under the illumination of several energy beams, and then it is transported to all directions through the strip pipeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard immediately sank, and now he is able to determine the purpose of this machine, which is a power supply for the energy of the high-energy beam gun outside the battleship. However, the problem is that this power furnace is too small. It can only supply a small area of ​​the warship with a high-energy beam gun on the surface of the warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
