			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes are bright, covering his mouth and laughing slightly The big eyes twitched slightly, and the crow's feather-like eyelashes suddenly fanned. He even asked: "Really, really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... For the first time, Tiamat suddenly discovered that the second time seemed to be less difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun mentions Tiamat, flies to the country where the dragon has been completed, and just finds a hole and plugs it in, saying: "The future Here is your place to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s voice just fell, and the light band of several magical powers flew out of the cave and landed in Tiamat. On the body, entangled it with a solid, this force gradually suppressed the resistance of the evil dragon, penetrated into the body of its body, and completely overwhelmed the power of the dragon itself. In the half plane, the legendary wizard is supreme. Existence, the evil dragon can not resist at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun stood at the entrance of the Dragon Cave and looked down at the little dragon in front of him. He said in a high tone: "After living for a month, you will leave." The dragon's right, the right to move in my half-face, is limited to five minutes a day. In addition, when I summon, you have to fight for me to offset the maintenance costs of the dark blue. Each battle can be offset by several. The specific figures are verified by me. If you will have some craftsmanship, it is best to tell me earlier. If I need it, I can also use it to offset your debt. When you repay the full debt, you can recover. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freedom." Tiamat almost couldn't believe his ears. He didn't think that the legendary mage actually left him a free path. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, freedom." Su Hailun did not know where to find the magic paper pen, brush brush filled a page, and then thrown to Tiamat: "This is your debt repayment plan. There are three options. The calculation formula is written on it. You choose it yourself. You have three minutes to make a decision. Of course, the total debt is 20 more than the normal loss. %, but who can make you beat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat’s hanging heart was slightly lowered, and the legendary Master was bright and even increased. The fact that 20% of the total debt has been said has shown that she does not care about what is being done in this respect. This is already a very very kind condition. Tiamat asked himself if he changed himself and had an overwhelming strength advantage. Not directly turning a few times is polite. By contrast, only adding 20% ​​of debt is not a problem. At least Tiamat and Su Helun’s fighting power is more than 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat went on to look down, but it was a glimpse. The legendary mage did list three options, but the formula for each item was extremely complicated, and countless symbols of almost the same size as the tip of the needle piled up into three daunting The formulas, these formulas, are the formula for the repayment and interest calculation of Tiamat debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat was still sneer at first, as a long-lived evil dragon, its knowledge is absolutely worthy, the magical mathematics of ordinary legendary wizards, In its eyes, it is not worth mentioning. It is necessary to know that in the process of parsing rules, magic mathematics is the basis of the foundation. Su Hailun wants to use this to make it difficult, but he has made a wrong idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three minutes, for the evil dragon, there are already too many minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat puts on a bitter look, in fact, at the glance, all three formulas are engraved in the mind, the next moment begins to analyze the crack A formula, just in an instant, tens of millions of data flowed through the mind of Tiamat, and in less than a second, it has tried more than 900 ways to crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but every time you make a small difference, you can crack the first formula, but at the end of the deduction, the evil dragon will find that he actually has some Understanding the deviations leads to a failure, it is uplifting, the consciousness is running at full speed, and the first formula is fighting hard, and time is unknowingly passing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the evil dragon suddenly remembered how long it took, and when it was thought, its cold sweat immediately came down, and consciousness already had The answer: two minutes and fifty seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running out, but the evil dragon is still struggling with the first formula, it doesn't know how many times he tried, but whenever he approaches cracking At the time, it will find that the mystery is still hidden in the formula, so everything has to be reinstated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is no longer enough, the evil dragon once again glanced at the three formulas, only by feeling, pressing on one of the options that looked relatively loose I got my own paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract came into effect immediately, and a beam of light connected Tiamat and Su Helun. Su Helun’s choice of Tiamat was undecided, just nodded and said "Here, stay here, don't think about escaping. In addition, the magic pool and the energy-absorbing forest cannot be close. Otherwise, if I die, I will resurrect you. The cost of the resurrection will also be added to the debt."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection, is it..." Tiamat’s voice trembled as if it were not a guarantee, but a terrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen said impatiently: "Of course it is not a magic contract creature, your soul has actually been bound in the dragon country, once dead, the soul will Returning to Longguo in an instant, with the soul, I can redo a dragon body for you, but the dragon body wants to do it well enough, the material will be used in a great amount, and the money is of course on your head." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat is relieved, if it is this kind of resurrection, then it will be acceptable, then it will be ashamed of Su Helen’s means and wealth, can do It’s not easy to get out of the dragon body. It’s not easy to get all the materials. When I think of the debt that will be increased by the resurrection, Tiamat feels that it’s black, and it’s not a last resort. It never wants to carry such a debt. Moreover, it I am very satisfied with my natural body. Even if I have been modified by Su Helun's art, my combat power has not declined. As long as he can leave this damn place, he can always find a way to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun threw the signed contract to Tiamat and said: "This contract is reserved for you. When you are free, you will continue to study if you are willing to study." But my suggestion is to put it aside, the debt will be calculated by me. Finally, there will be a slave servant to give you food every day. If you want to add a meal, you can do it. The elf slave will be You booked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat nodded again and again, but when Su Helun left, it immediately unfolded the magic contract and stared at himself to shoot the claws. The third formula printed is studied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after watching for a minute, Tiamat’s heart was a cold, and the calculation was only one-third. It found that the original idea was simply wrong. Compared with the first formula that has been parsed several times, only the first part of the value has more signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It barely suppressed the panic in the heart, stared at the formula, and began to concentrate on the study, in its world, time passed quickly, but The three formulas are like three endless mountains. No matter how Tiamat climbs, there is always a higher mountain in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dragon's densely-knit dragon cave, suddenly a few faucets were extended, and they looked around and confirmed that the legendary mage had indeed left the half-plane. Carefully slipped out of the dragon's hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dragons are obviously already licensed by the wind, and there are still the same number of dragons in the dragon's cave. They have not been able to wait for the time limit. They can only honestly nest in the dragon's cave. The dragons that can fly are pretending to be inadvertently. Passing through the dragon's cave at Tiamat, I saw that the evil dragon was lying in the hole, staring at the magic contract, and constantly writing and writing on the ground. It was so focused, and did not notice that there are still a few outside the dragon. Double peeping eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few dragons quickly used up their free time and had to go back to their own dragon caves. The dragons poked their heads and mutual There is a constant exchange of magical sounds in the dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really the evil dragon Tiamat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was actually under the Highness It’s a kind of look, it doesn’t seem to be called adults in the future, it has become like us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tiamat seems to be In the research contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be alive after the last month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not for the dragon at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, those formulas are completely traps."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what is the existence of those formulas that have not been calculated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispers of the dragons echoed silently in the semi-planet, and the legendary wizard crossed the space and appeared in the position that the portal was built above the dark blue, just coming out of the portal, Su Helun A golden bristles on the forehead immediately erected and pointed in an indefinite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun looked up and saw the uncertainty under the night, the eyes immediately chilled, the little face immediately cooled down and said: "It is you, You actually came back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing faintly said: "Where is the place in the outer domain, I have been missing for a long time, Su Hailun, are you okay?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
