			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment to determine the fate of Richard and Stevenson is finally here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night before the scheduled match day, the legendary Master who had been without audio finally returned to Dark Blue, and all the great Magisters were relieved. If she does not come back, then the date of the game must be pushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, this game is undoubtedly one of the focuses of the dark blue affairs. As time goes by, people who talk about the game on various occasions and debate the ending more and more. Although the scale of the event is limited to two people, the aura of the legendary Master's pro-disciples and future architects is dazzling and eye-catching for ordinary apprentices and magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Deep Blue, the legendary Master immediately called the Magisters to discuss the matter. Her little eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, and obviously the mood is not very good. Therefore all the great mages are sitting quietly, not to provoke her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen left and waited, but found that his snacks did not come up late. It was hard to hope that the black skin slaves, but the slaves not only came in a golden pot, but also the fruit types in the pots were monotonous. Su Hailun’s favorite things were all gone, and the number only reached the pot of the golden pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s eyebrows finally stood up this time: “What is going on here, where is my fruit!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold immediately got together and whispered: "All sold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? I last took it It’s enough to save the food for half a year!!” The legendary Master’s voice immediately improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mountain and the sea are bigger than your meal, and she has been eating for three months, so the food you left is really not much. ..." Gray dwarf said cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How has she not gone yet?" The legendary Master's voice suddenly became cold. The gray dwarf was prepared, and immediately handed in two lists: "She really hasn't gone yet... but you see, this is the money you get from selling the grain. This is her spending in the dark blue during this time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing two bills, Su Hailun’s face is much better. The income always makes her happy, and Black Gold knows her pride very much, and she does not accept more mountains or sea than a gold coin. However, the happiness brought by these incomes to the legendary Master is far less than expected, and even the results of this hard work for several months have not made her mood high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in these two months, Su Hailun made a net worth of Azshara. This is equivalent to her income in the past year, but can not bring her more happiness. The reason is very simple. The higher the income, the more the legendary mage sees the gap between himself and the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unhappy legendary Master put down the bill and praised the black gold, and asked: "Is the game ready for tomorrow?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master said: "Everything is ready, you will be waiting for you to come back and host it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Start on time, it seems that there is nothing to be found in Soram, and by the way, see what kind of surprise my little Richard can bring us."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf cautiously asked: "His Royal Highness, do you want to make some preparations in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare? What preparation?" The legendary Master is a little surprised, she has stood up Ready to leave, seeing the expression of black gold desperately suggesting something, even more surprised, "How can my little Richard lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold had to say something More straightforward: "But the Soram family is fully supportive of Stevenson, and his magical structure is self-made, but the design is entirely from Santa Cruz. Your Richard is I was relying on myself to explore, and I did not receive any animal hair from the family and the mountains and the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mountain and the sea did not give him a Zhang Huolong neck skin?" Su Hailun asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee sealed the fire dragon skin and did not use it at all," Blackkin explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s face was immediately better, even with a smile. She lazily stretched out and said, "Don't worry, Santa Cruz's waste only knows the rules of death, there is no idea, and it is impossible to enter the realm of the big framer in this life. What is good? Worried, what can he design? In fact, I have already taken him into consideration when I have a problem. This guy is putting 30 holy characters in front of his name, and don’t want to let Sidvinson’s hand let The snow rabbit defeated the winter wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Richard may not be able to do it!" Black Gold has discovered that Su Hailun has no design plan for Richard. Know, so remind again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun waved his hand impatiently and said, "Which is so troublesome! No matter what the final result is, it is not finished to announce that Richard won?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray dwarfs: "How do you explain to the Soram family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legendary Master After a cry, he said, "Just say that the song is paid more! If there is any dissatisfaction with Soram, let him go directly to Gordon to go to the theory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gray dwarf glimpse, Su Helun has walked to the door, watching her hold a small fist on her lips, constantly yawning, apparently going to rest. Black gold couldn’t say anything at all, but he nodded and said yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night passed calmly, and the next morning at 9:00 is the official start of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue is located in the private magic field of Su Hailun in the dark blue main tower, and only the legendary mage and the crowd are present in addition to the two sides participating in the competition. Big Magister. The mountains and the sea are considered to belong to the side of Richard, so she sits beside Richard, and Urazza, Steel Rock and the court guards are behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Stevenson side, the people sent by the Soram family privately protested to the Black Gold, thinking that the people on the mountain and the sea should not appear here. The events are not open, and they are likely to secretly intervene in the game. Others don't say that if the great sacrifice 祀拉拉扎祖 secretly kills the snow rabbit of Stevenson, no one can see it on the Soram side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Soram’s protest was dismissed by Black Gold. The event is not open, but isn’t the mountain and the shipwreck a student of His Highness? In addition, he also righteously protested their contempt for the dark blue, even if Soram could not see, there are legendary mages and great magisters. Under the gray dwarf's momentum, Soram Fang suddenly felt that he was losing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
