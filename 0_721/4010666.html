			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, once again into the hall of the legendary mage, Richard looks There are two gates that have been hurriedly loaded. The texture is an unknown material close to the stone. The whole is vicissitudes of bronze. Those patterns are not a product of Noland, nor a dark blue aesthetic. The indigenous products that were obtained from which planes were installed directly, and the parts combined with the door frame were still somewhat rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goalkeeper's elf is also very sluggish, without the aura of the past, the forest, the water, the lawn and the magical sun disappeared in the hall, the ground There are cracks everywhere in the wall, and pieces of large and small peeling off are scattered and scattered, like a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the magic array was destroyed, various scenes including the Emerald Dream no longer appeared, there were traces of burnt black everywhere, and large pieces such as melted Glass-like crystals, there is a small black hole in the east from the height of three people. From time to time, the sound of the wind is blowing. The place may be connected to a storage space or an energy pool. Now cover it. All the decorations on the floor were broken, so they were naked/exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are only a few elves in the big hall, they are busy going back and forth, they are cleaning up the garbage, and the repair of the whole temple needs Su Hailun’s hands. I don't know how much time it will take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went all the way to Su Hailun’s dormitory, and perhaps only the floor-to-ceiling windows and Su Hailun’s sleeping stone were completely preserved in the hall. Now the legendary mage has Woke up, no longer willing to sleep on the hard stone platform, so I pulled out a big bed from the warehouse and threw it at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Hailun is floating in the air, manipulating a large number of blue ripples, repairing the damage on the wall, Richard has come here to see the ice The brilliance of the crystal, never noticed the things behind the dreamy blue color. Now the crystal is almost destroyed, revealing the inner wall of the sky. It is a kind of strange blue metal that Richard does not know at all. Under the magical control of Su Hailun, the blue metal began to soften, constantly changing its shape, and even growing a section, re-delineating the shape of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard came in, Su Hailun did not say back: "Go, help me to put another pot of fruit over."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, an empty fruit bowl next to the legendary mage flew to the front of Richard. Li took the fruit bowl and walked to the private warehouse of the legendary mage, filled a pot and returned it to Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a few comet titanium ingots in the corner, help me get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard ran over, added several states to himself, and inspired the construction, only to move these pieces of titanium ingots that looked like bricks, but actually weighed dozens of tons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, an afternoon time is in the middle of the miscellaneous and errands, but Richard feels very happy, as if he had returned to dark blue when he first came twelve years ago. Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Su Hailun called him, just to find a job that can help her, Richard’s heart is somewhat puzzled, and the comet titanium gold ingot does not eat anti-gravity. Although he is not able to move with magic and construction aids, it may be more efficient to find a power-type battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s golden hair was softly squatting, seemingly deeply helpless for her disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a magic bell ringing in the hall, and it was dinner time. It is reasonable to say that the restoration work should come to an end. Su Hailun finally turned his head and saw Li. Take a look and say, "Okay, you can go to rest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over, but Richard always feels that something is wrong. The legendary mage seems to have something to say, but he always avoids talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, even the golden hair can’t stand it anymore, suddenly stand up and jump hard, it certainly can’t jump out, just pull the legendary sergeant’s scalp Acute pain, could not help but cover his head, angered: "You want to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after such a trouble, the point in Su Hailun’s heart is tangled She also lost a lot. She glanced at Richard and said, "Standing here and waiting for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the legendary mage, Richard has long been used to it. Obedience, this is the habit of the past ten years, and it can be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun ran to his own warehouse, looking east, and finally found out the delicate gold balance, and then turned out a bunch of big The small and small weights ran out again. Looking at it, there was no table in the hall. So she simply put the balance on the ground. First, I took a weight and put it aside. Then I read the words in the mouth. Add a weight on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more weights in the tray, but they are still hanging high in the air, as if these dozens of large and small weights are added together, but also the small weight that was originally put down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage is already a little angry, the little eyebrows are getting up and down, the fingers are constantly holding a weight, and then they are thrown onto the tray, only I personally experienced it, only to know that the legendary mage's soft and watery appearance is an illusion, and that she knows that her little body has the power to smash the dragon, and she is stunned by her little hand, that is, the dragon horn of Tiamat Twisted into a ball, but this weight does not know what to do, but it is unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new weight is dropped on the pallet and the balance still does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood by and recognized that this was the balance that he had seen once in the past, when he could not see the strangeness of this balance, now Curiosity, so I took the insight and carefully observed the balance. This time, in Richard’s vision, there were faint lines of faint lines implicated on the balance. These lines sometimes expanded and sometimes gathered, but each one The nodes seem to follow what is connected to each other, and they will be different every moment. Every time a weight is dropped, the law of the line will appear completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that these are the lines of the rule. It seems that this balance is absolutely extraordinary, and it can actually motivate the rules. This is a feature that artifacts may have. However, Richard did not see what type of rules the balance ignited, so he tried to model the wisdom talent and parse the rules he saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a little try, but Richard is frowning, the forces of these rules mapped in his consciousness are all irregular, there is no It is possible to build a model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of magic philosophy, Richard once learned that since it is a rule, there must be a law, even if complete confusion is actually a rule, now this The situation can only show that the level of the rule of the balance is far higher than the rules that Richard has analyzed in the past, even if it is the rule of the mountain of Hughland, or the rules of the sacred dynasty It is better to try several times in succession and finally make sure that you want to resolve this rule. It is simply impossible task, at least for the foreseeable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I lose a weight, Su Hailun’s mouth is full of words, but her voice is very vague, she can’t hear anything in her voice, Richard I got up my ears and only caught a few unconventional words such as makeup and star, and I didn't understand what she was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weights were stacked on the trays, and the trays were full, almost no position, but the tray on the other side was still firmly nailed to the ground, and it didn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of Su Helen, only the last and the smallest weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage swelled his cheeks and suddenly grabbed the last weight and yelled "Fresh and delicious.", he dropped the weight. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight dropped, but it provoked a loud noise, it seems that the whole world is responding, the balance is shaking, just in the stunned legendary Master’s stunned, slowly turning Finally picked up the tray on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How familiar is this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have seen a big hand with a destiny invisibly, picking up the same straw twice and overwhelming the same camel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still too late to feel the fate of the belly and the drama, suddenly the heart is cold, because the legendary Master has turned his head and stared at him, both eyes are bright Can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of great disaster in Licha, as if the whole planet was coming, he immediately found himself an illusion, but it was almost the same, because Su Hailun, the legendary mage’s figure is slightly petite, and it’s a whole shorter than the one that has grown completely now, but the momentum is as good as the whole continent, not for Richard. The next evasive gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that the front was dark, the whole vision, and even the whole body and mind were occupied by the legendary Master. Richard said that under the legend, there was no enemy, but there was no resistance. The ground was thrown down, pressed, because the legendary Master's legend is a humble modifier, and because the legend includes a huge range of strength, from 21 to 30, can be called legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s body is getting hotter and hotter, so the heat of the volcanic blood is so hot that she only slightly swells inside the body. Magic, if the clothes on the two are blown by the undercurrent between the planes, they will be wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Li, who was suppressed, could not move at all, that is, he wanted to struggle, and it was useless. Richard’s blood, real name and even the composition seemed to be all In a state of dying, even the insignificant starting force could not be used. This was not a failure, but an instinctive fear. He finally forced the power, but no matter how hard it was, there was no effect. In a flash, Li Zhijue If you want to move the little white hand that you hold down, the difficulty is probably no less than the removal of the dark blue. At this moment, Richard finally realized the feeling that a hummingbird was trampled by an elephant. Do you want to move it like a leg? There are no doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
