			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time belts are wrapped around Richard, but they just touched Richard The body of the head of Licha faintly reveals a time hourglass. All the time and light strips are instantly rewinded and returned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great screamer suddenly screamed and squirted a blood! There was also a time hourglass on her head, but the difference was immediately revealed compared to Richard's time hourglass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her time hourglass is about half a metre in size, the time sand inside is gray, occasionally flashing a touch of gold sè, the ends of the hourglass have eternal The emblem of the Dragon of Time has no other decorations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s time hourglass is as long as one meter, and the sand inside is all brilliant gold. The ends of the hourglass are not only the emblem of the light dragon. And there is another mysterious badge, which is the symbol of Richard as the space lord. In addition, the time hourglass is also covered with gorgeous gold sè, and constantly changing the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragon never do anything useless, the decoration on the hourglass is not only a pattern of ornamental value, but a true embodiment of eternal and time. The dragon of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each badge and decoration represent a special kind of grace. The size of the hourglass and the shape of the sand are the time that can be mobilized. Force size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, just look at the appearance of the hourglass that everyone can condense, you can know his position in the mind of the old dragon. The more golden the light, the more the local tyrants prove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, because of the conflict between the two sides, dozens of powerful Knights of the Dragon Hall are pouring into the hall, and several great priests are standing on the spot, watching Richard and this. The conflict of a great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s timeglass was floating, several big priests were screaming, because they knew very well how deep the gods of this time hourglass! The god of Richard, far above the so-called big gods, may only be worse than the two true gods of Vatican and quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge glitz of this hourglass is something that these great priests have never seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expulsion is an exclusive magical technique of the Dragon Temple, which can forcibly transfer the creatures in the Eternal Dragon Hall to the outside of the temple and mark him with an eternal mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eviction mark, you can't enter the Eternal Dragon Hall for life, even the legendary powerhouse. Unless there is another powerful god, the great god official removes the mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very tough deity, and the limitations and costs of using it are equally great. However, as long as the quantity and quality of a person's sacrifice reaches a certain standard, it is difficult to be forced to expel, and the expulsion can not be marked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest is actually only trying, if Richard’s god is not enough, it will be temporarily transmitted to the Eternal Dragon Hall. Even if there is no mark, this is equivalent to a loud slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her original thoughts, as a legendary mage, Richard couldn’t stand such humiliation, but couldn’t help but be a great priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall. So the best solution is to hurry and leave, the longer you stay, the more humiliating you are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the hardship of eviction, the cost of using it is equally huge. The standard of this magical measure lies in the amount of grace that both sides receive, absolutely fair, and there is no way to smuggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal and time dragon has a reputation at this point, who is useful to it, and who it cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before leaving the Holy Alliance, Richard’s sacrifice was like eating and drinking, and even the top sacrifices were taken several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was not a sacred architect, he was extravagant to the extent of using the grace to force the transition to the floating island track, let alone now? Those gods used on the floating islands may be pure waste in the eyes of the world, but they can be clearly recorded in the books of the old dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, perhaps the whole Noland continent can be hard-fought on the old dragon gods, and there is really no one. Even if there is one or two, it is not that these houses are housed in the Temple of Eternal Dragon all day long. Poor Baba is looking forward to receiving some hard-working priests from the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the great sergeant’s expulsion of Richard became a hard fight for the grace of both sides. Of course she is not an opponent at all, and now she is countered by the power of time. How much power she used to get out, how much power bounced back. This is equivalent to being attacked by one's own strength. Where she got it, she immediately vomited and seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn't stand, standing on one knee, pointing her finger at Richard, and shouted: "You dare to attack the priest in the eternal dragon hall! Come and kill him, no, expel!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not completely confused, knowing that it is impossible to kill a person with such a deep god in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, which would directly provoke the dragon of eternal and time. The anger. So her order was just expulsion, and the Knights of the Temple were hesitant, but they slowly approached Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great priest is the chief priest of the eternal dragon temple of the Millennium Empire, second only to the great priest holding the Palm Palace. Under the years of the prestige, these knights chose to obey orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a cold smile on his face and slowly said: "It seems that you are really too arrogant, I really think that I am like the priest of other gods." The same is the embodiment of God's will and majesty? If you still can't clearly understand the will of the eternal and the dragon of time, then I will give you a lesson today! It's just that the tuition for this class is a bit expensive!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, and Richard raised his hand to the seriously wounded priest, and said: "Expulsion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is not big, but there is a thunder in the ears of everyone! And he said this in lingua franca, and did not use any gods with additional power. How to see it, it is like a hollow and weak words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the entire Eternal Dragon Hall suddenly vibrates, and the power of time is like a mad cháo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the huge and flashy time hourglass on the top of the head, and the time hourglass on the head of the great priest was drunk in the sound of Richard, but suddenly there were countless turtles. Cracked, then burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time slippery? Everyone can hardly believe their eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These big priests were even dreaming and couldn’t think of such a scene. They screamed in horror and couldn’t even call out. The break of the hourglass means that all grace is removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is the eternal dragon temple priest. From this moment, the power of the great priest will be directly reduced from the 18th level to the first level, with the mortal No different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the mark of the ruins appeared on the head of the great priest, and then the time belt of light quickly entangled her. After a flash of light, the great priest had disappeared from the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal dragon temple is silent, all the priests and the knights are on the spot, watching the power of time slowly return to the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the ruin-like pattern is the eviction mark. It seems that the great priest was really expelled from the Eternal Dragon Hall and marked. Just like she wants to do with Richard. Unless there is a person who is deeper than the god of Richard, she will not be able to step into the eternal dragon temple forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but seeing this scene, all the priests and knights, even the two great magisters sent by the Tumen prince to escort the Richards have understood Where can I find someone who is deeper than Richard Shenen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really makes these big priests frightened is the break of the hourglass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has erased the grace of the great priest, not without cost, how much grace he has erased, and how much grace he has to pay accordingly. The terrible thing is that Richard waved the time and hourglass of the big priest. The timeglass of his time did not change much, but he lost two golden patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priests who noticed this detail all sighed: This Richard, how much grace! ? Moreover, the incident itself also shows that Richard’s authority in the Eternal and Time Dragon is much higher than these great priests. The two sides are not at a level at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard immediately fell on the knights who tried to drive themselves, and said coldly: "You have seen my god, but still Dare to come up! Stupid and daring to pay for it, not to pack you up, how can I make those idiots who are not convinced in my heart know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard The voice, the Knights of the Temple screamed one by one, fell directly to the ground, and the power of time was drawn from them, and then fell into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard only took half of the time on them, and he was still merciless. However, the future of these knights was all abolished, and even the qualifications for becoming a shrine knight have been lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big priests are bleak, but no one dares to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every decision, Richard did not use the proverb, but the lingua franca. However, the Eternal Dragon Temple itself has become a tool for carrying out his will. Every sentence and every decision of his will be executed in the most thorough manner. Of course, the premise is that Richard has enough grace to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the running dogs, they are all painful. However, even if Richard took out half of the gods of the Temple Knights in one breath, his time hourglass was only a little less than a golden pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dense gold sè, the stupid people know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha turned to the two great magisters sent by the two Princes of Tumen, and said with a deep meaning: "The channel of the Prince, it seems It’s not so easy to use.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big magisters’ faces were slightly changed and busy: “There should be no trouble now, you can sacrifice at will. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "There is no trouble." He said, he glanced at the big priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has heard his words, that is, the trouble has been killed. If there is any trouble, he doesn't mind killing all his opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, as long as you have enough grace, the simpler and more rude way, the more directly effective. Divine power covers the eternal and timeless dragons of countless planes, and there is only one criterion for judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the sacrifice. Richard casually pointed to a large priest as the host and went to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Looking at the background data, moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VIPs on the 1st and 2nd have surpassed a lord, and this is a gift from hundreds of readers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't thank you a little, only to empty the deposit box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
