Richard looked at the statue again and suddenly snorted. This group of statues was so vivid that the discovery of it was more realistic than human craftsmen. The limit that can be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou said in a faint voice: "They are not statues, but the living beings who have been turned into statues by divine power. I can still feel that their souls are still being The seal is crying in the statue. This punishment will be eternal, because these statues are immovable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Naiyou grabbed from the statue A small piece of stone was laid, and the statue was repaired and damaged by itself, and the stone caught by Naiyu became a gray stone powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes spurted out again, and then faded away after a while, then a little tired on his face, saying: “The darkness in the land is filled with The power of the ground fire is the source of strength to repair these statues. However, these forces are said to be the opposite of the god of courage. It is more and more interesting. It seems that we are right in this place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to Taniguchi, and Nye and I-Russ quietly exchanged a look, and their hearts were all in vain, because Richard was so easy Seeing the essence and operation of the power of the statue, even they are hard to say so clearly. Divine power is different from magic. It is ever-changing and often integrates with the environment. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to distinguish clearly. Russia is not an ordinary sacred official. Before coming to the world, he used to stay in a certain place for a long time. Even so, they are limited by this body, and it is difficult to understand the power of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of Richard will become very scary in the battle, no matter how many tricks the opponent has, it is difficult to get through his eyes. The best way is to follow Lee. If you look at hard and hard competitions, the tricks of playing tricks are similar to playing with fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian slowly walked into the Black Valley, and did not go far to hear the sound of the metal collision, the line of sight, and finally the figure, that There are several men, all of whom are wearing heavy chains, and each action will drive the chains to collide. They hold the shovel and shovel the black soil from the ground, put them in the back basket, and fill them in a basket. They will turn back into the valley. These people are like a skeleton without souls. They continually dig, and when they leave one, they will come out again from the valley to fill the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard went to a few prisoners and looked at the place where they dug. So I found that the power of the pink color with aphrodisiac effect in these places was extraordinarily strong, except for this small place, other places were normal. When the black soil is dug away, you can see that the ground below is squirming like a huge creature's organ, and it begins to secrete more black soil, but this land has been dug into a shallow pit. Sometimes prisoners stop and stop digging. When this happens, it is necessary that the black soil is dug out, revealing the underlying fleshy substrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He observed for a while and pointed to the hillside not far away and said, "That place is not bad."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place that Richard pointed out was another place where the power of pinkness was very strong. His words finally let several prisoners react, but these prisoners looked at Richard’s eyes and could not tell. The strangeness is not fear, nor hate. In short, it is an indescribable state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elderly prisoner said slowly: "Go there and see." Another strong-looking male man dragged his weight and walked over. The location pointed out by Richard dug down until he dug a pit two meters deep and jumped. For a moment he climbed out of the ground and shouted: "A rich point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the prisoners showed their joy. The older prisoner glanced at Richard and said, "You have shuddering eyes, young people, tell me, you are The messenger of my god is still an enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes it is an enemy, sometimes a friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man is obviously somewhat surprised by Richard’s answer, because in this sentence, Richard actually placed himself in the position of juxtaposition with the god of courage, he said slowly: "You are unexpectedly arrogant, Maybe one day you will have the qualification to say this sentence, but it is not now. In fact, many people behind me have been as arrogant as you are. They are in the same situation as me, not even as good as me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we are not talking about the same thing, I am not arrogant, but in Narrative of a fact, I am not a believer in the god of courage, so the god of courage is nothing but a powerful to a special soul. The soul is part of the rules, before the rules of the true plane of origin, powerful It is also a soul. Weakness is also a soul. Moreover, on the basis of the plane, there are deeper rules that govern all planes, such as time and space. Therefore, it is not me who is arrogant, but must The guy who distinguishes himself from other souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s words made the old man feel a little shocked. He slowly nodded and said, “Maybe you are right. There is a madman named Bruno in this valley. He has a similar opinion with you. I heard that he has written a book in recent years. If you are lucky, you may have to take a look, but no one knows where he hides the book, that is, the regulator does not know, in order to thank you. Help us find a rich point, you can ask another question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name." Richard once again let the old man accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I almost forgot what I called, oh, Ptolemy, it seems to be the name."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I will go in." Richard waved to say goodbye to the old man, just like walking in the Black Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the thoughtful look of Richard, Liu Sha asked: "Why, is this name very special?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "If I remember correctly, there is a pope in the church of the god of courage called Ptolemy. He is said to have died in an emergency, but it is all It’s more than three hundred years ago. Normally, it’s hard for Faro’s people to live so long, but in this land of punishment, it’s hard to say, nothing, let’s go.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road into the valley is long and rugged, the sky is getting darker and darker, the clouds in the sky have long become thick black, and only a few places are rich in lead color, actually become In the shiny area, on the sides of the mountain wall, a torch is inserted, burning a bright yellow flame, illuminating a small area around, from time to time you can see three or five groups of prisoners gathered in Under the mountain wall, the rock was hardly hit, and the mountain wall was also black, but it was exceptionally hard. All the way, Richard noticed that there was no A person can be chipped from the hillside even a small piece of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still bright, but the black valley is like a late night, a torch can only provide a negligible light, transmitting darkness in the rock gap of the mountain wall The red light, this is the biggest source of illumination. The oncoming roads are filled with heavy footsteps and heavy breathing, as if a giant elephant was crawling, and at the end of the road is a giant taller than the ogre. Obese, the width and height of the body are almost the same. It is a moving mountain of meat. He has a huge deformed arm with no fingers at the end. There are only a dozen tentacles like octopuses. He walks slowly and scans both sides from time to time. The prisoner at work did not know which prisoner had angered him. He swung the giant hand and slammed the prisoner onto the mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
