			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an exceptionally powerful construction that combines the characteristics of a composite assembly . If the effect it provides is enhanced, it can be considered a third-order construction! Even now, this structure can play a role in the battlefield in a specific situation, and can surpass many general-purpose third-order structures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd of breathless people finally couldn’t help themselves, began to breathe, and then the breathing became more and more heavy. Many people have begun to conceive tactics around life, and many ideas emerge in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not leave the audience with too much time to think about it, but took out the fifth frame of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a frame! The people in the audience almost boiled. They saw the vitality in the third frame. When they saw the guardian of life in the fourth frame, what would the fifth frame bring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wildness journey. This is a non-standard version of the second-order structure, the requirements for carrying capacity are medium. It can provide a little defense to the subject. At the same time, it slightly increases the speed of movement and improves the ability to pass through in complex terrain. This is a structure that can be used on the knight or on the mount..." Richard introduced it with a constant flat voice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the audience in the East Hall has increased a lot. From the beginning of the activity of Richard, there are people coming from the West Hall. Some nobles who did not have much interest in low-level construction began to send their own assistants. But until now, the total number of people in the East Hall is less than one-fifth of the West Hall, because Master Luno has not released his new structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has introduced the wilderness journey very flatly. This is a very singularly structured installation. On the surface, it seems that the improvement of combat effectiveness is not significant. Like the previous four, the magical images are retained after the wilderness journey is released. In this way, on each side of Richard, there are five magic images of each. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many people are starting to look forward to it, looking forward to the sixth build, and looking forward to what surprises this talented young builder will bring to them. Shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was a sudden exclamation in the temple: "These five constructs...does it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes were drawn to the five newly released structures. They saw an image of a knight in the magical image, five structures falling on the knight, and a wilderness journey. Attached to the battle immediately. However, this is not the end, but the beginning is just the beginning. A shiny magical pattern begins to emerge and connects the five structures together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the West Hall, Vonster is exhausting all his strength, burning all the passion, screaming loudly: "Now, my Teacher, the royal master of the Holy Alliance, Master Luno Ray Fabio, will show his pinnacle! In the hands of Master Luno, the costume has become art!!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a round of applause, Luno climbed the platform with a calm and proud smile, then looked down. The crowd is still dense, and countless expectations are gathering on him. However, compared with the beginning of the conference, the number of people is significantly less, and many people below are still whispering, I don't know what to talk about, obviously did not focus on him. What is even more hateful is that people are constantly leaving the West Hall at this time and rushing to the East Hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is him, the Holy Alliance Royal Architect Lu Nuo, the key moment to publish his peak work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Luno almost couldn’t control his anger, roared angrily, and let the unfocused guys get out of the press conference. Finally, his reason is still there, he has controlled himself and has not done such a stupid thing. But Luno has determined to use these latest works to give these people a very loud slap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can despise a big builder! Luno growled in the bottom of his heart. In front of the real big builder, Richard is a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took a deep breath, Luno Province has prepared a long speech that was originally prepared, and cut the subject directly at twice the volume: "Everyone, next show It is the latest achievement of my research in the past three years. Its power has completely surpassed the third-order structure, and it is only one step away from the fourth-order structure! Now let me show this art of the world in front of you! The name is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream in the crowd suddenly overwhelmed Luno’s voice: "Set! It's a suit! Published by Richard on the East Side. It’s a set!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the crowd blew up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Set?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go and see! Damn, is it really a suit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is flowing and swarming away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the West Hall is empty. Luno’s voice echoed in the hall: “...injury guard”, its function is mainly composed of two aspects...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luno’s The mouth was closed a few times, but did not make any sound, the function of hurting the guard is not known. The magical image on the high stage played the injury guard at this time, but no one has seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen people standing in the audience, both Luno and Fengster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luno’s eyes were black, squirting a blood, and tilted his head backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, teacher!" Fengster panicked and quickly helped Luno. At this moment, his heart is incomprehensible, and his body is cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fall of Luno, Vonster envisioned the supreme honor, the vast wealth, and even the privilege of doing what he wanted, most of which has turned into a cloud. From this moment on, even without their mentoring, the Knights of the Holy Alliance royal family will not be defeated. At the beginning of the conference, the assertions of Vonster and Luno will become the laughing stock of the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Hall is overcrowded, and many others are trying to squeeze in. In the city of Ukihad, there are still many people who have just gotten the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical knights on both sides of the high platform are slowly spinning, and the five structures of the body and the mount are connected by complicated magic lines. Into a whole. And the magic array that was originally invisible to use, it shows the effect at this moment. That is the key to linking all the fabrics together. At this moment, people’s loud voices are so eager to fly the majestic temple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous problems lie to Richard, the core content is the ability of the suit, and the name of the suit. But in the thunderous sound, Richard's volume is ten times larger, and no one will hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands, and the sound of the hall quickly fell and became an absolute silence, only ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything was in silence, Richard did not speak, first looking around the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform of the station where Richard is standing is only about one meter high. There are many interracial people in the temple, and their height is higher than that of Richard standing on the podium. But at this moment, almost everyone feels that Richard is looking down on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when Wan Hao was in silence, all eyes, all attention, and all the focus were on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three hundred years, the builders who showed the suits at the first exhibition of their life, only the shining sacred sect Gadhi! At that time, he released the series of twilight knights that later became popular in mainland China. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few seconds of silence has made people feel as if they have passed the entire century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Richard’s voice sounded: “This set of features is called “The Wild Barrier.” After the ability of the suit is activated, it can form a defensive shield, shield. The intensity increases with the level of the knight, and in general, it can withstand the full blow of the opponent whose level is higher than the level three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means The 12-level knight with a wild barrier can withstand the full-scale blow of the fifteen-level knight. On the battlefield, it means an extra life. This is a very practical set effect, although it is not amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dry voice suddenly sounded: "This is...suit knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Knight It has a unique meaning, it refers to the mass-produced, package-based knight. Mass production is the real key. Such a second-order mixed suit such as the wild barrier, due to the performance of various configurations, the overall power may even be stronger than the full second-order knight. Most people are still immersed in the glory of the release of the package at the first press conference of Richard, ignoring the fact that the set is actually a production suit for the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand again, so the East Temple was quiet, only to hear his voice echoing in the temple. In the hands of Richard, the sixth frame appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This structure is a 'power outbreak', in addition to providing a certain amount of power increase, it can also greatly increase the power when activated, similar to the explosion... When it replaces the guardian of life, it is another suit. I call it a 'wild blow'.... These two suits belong to the 'deep wildness' series..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard echoed in the hall. No one noticed that there was a small figure at the entrance to the main hall. She wrapped her body in a cloak with a hood, and the flashing amber eyes revealed her identity inadvertently. Seeing every sentence that Richard said on the stage touched the hearts of countless people, she floated a shallow smile and turned away and quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has long been familiar with the two suits of Richard. She came here, just want to witness this moment and witness the moment when Richard officially boarded the mainland stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
