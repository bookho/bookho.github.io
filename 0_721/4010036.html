			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Richard is obviously very upset, don’t understand that What is wrong, added: "After the killers were found to be traces, isn’t it the dish on the plate? With the inside of the infantry, the cavalry is outside, the shooter shoots in the encirclement, that is not there. How much does it kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falco's face is blue and white, I don't know what to say. This kind of statement is theoretically correct. Before being launched, it was trampled on the trail of the killer. The ability to face the battle is not like the level of warriors and legal officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem lies in the discovery of the trail, like the killer of the Black Wing, but also the discovery can be found? At least he still has no such ability. He believes that Luo Fu does not have this ability. He only knows the same wonderful face of Luo Fu at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Master Richard, you are a man who can make a miracle!" Falcao said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God is the origin of all miracles." Richard suddenly looked so solemn and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everyone thinks. The gods are indeed the source of miracles, but behind the Richards there is a god hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back to the hotel, Liusha found an opportunity to whisper quietly: "Licha, your acting skills are getting more and more powerful! If you are willing to join the temple It must be one of the most qualified big priests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Between life and death, growth will always be faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are only seventeen!” The sand is dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is just smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With second-order wisdom, he is mature under the seventeen-year-old body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to his room, the maid had already burned a tank of hot water at the instructions of Richard, and infused with lavender juice that could be calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stepped into the bathtub and soaked the whole body in hot water. The exhaustion of the multi-day campaign flowed out from the open pores. He relaxed himself and began to think about the wars of this time, while sorting out the power of the analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing of the Black Wing gives Richard enough confidence, as long as he is properly prepared, with the power he has at hand, even the ordinary Sanctuary is not killing Can't fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle against a single target, the mirror and boiling of the sand is the most critical ability. The boiling fit can be applied at a high speed, and the spell with its own penetration effect can exert its maximum power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark is another very important person, and the level of magic at the thirteenth level allows him to cast seven levels of magic. The power of auxiliary magic has been fully shown when killing the Black Wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, Oral, Sandro and quicksand, Clark have the power to reverse the local battle. As many as two hundred barbarian warriors are the core of the army, and the throwing soldiers are the most effective strike force. In addition, the sand cavalry is also a vital force for reasons of quantity and environment. Although there are hundreds of gunmen joining, the sand cavalry still has the advantage of being able to get the complement of the troops with just money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, Richard himself. The role of wisdom and precision is becoming more and more significant, and Richard’s control of the battlefield has reached an amazing level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each battle, Richard will play back the process in his mind, thinking about where to do it is not good enough, and where can be improved . Richard now carries a book related to war, which may be the life of a famous coach, including the work of some military strategists. When there is time, Richard will also play some battles. However, the battles that were staged were all small-scale battles. After all, it is still far from the point of commanding a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for war, more with politics, you can plant some seeds in advance, but with his current influence, it is far from being able to control them to sprout roots. Rely on opportunities. For example, treat the noble unicorn viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Richard, who has the wisdom and precision of the two gods, is increasingly capable of manipulating magic. This not only helps him to increase his strength in the magical structure, but also directly affects the use of magic. For example, when casting a natural call of level 6, Richard can slightly affect the magic effect by fine-tuning the magic, for example, letting six violent bears line up in a neat row...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bathtub for about ten minutes, the water is getting colder, and the fatigue of Richard's body has also eased a lot. In the ten minutes, Richard re-introduced the various combat plans for Tutub and Chuck. His current thinking speed is at least ten times that of ordinary people. The ten-minute deduction is equivalent to one and a half hours of thinking by other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the bathtub, put on his clothes, returned to the bedroom, and began to meditate every day. The powerful legendary mage, the magic is also raised by meditation a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tenth grade, Richard’s goal is to increase the magic of two standard units every day, so that after a month and a half, he will officially Beyond the basic requirements of the 12th Master for magic, you can try to learn more of the six levels of magic, and have enough magic to draw most of the standard second-order construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard sat down, he quickly entered the state of deep meditation. His consciousness gradually spread out of the body, and the body reappeared in consciousness. But as the magic gradually spread out of the body, there were actually three blue stars appearing around! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his heart and immediately captured three stars and inhaled them one by one. After the integration of the three stars, the magic of a small area is dyed blue. Now Richard can see that there are many more blue-blue light spots in the magic of his body. These are the star powers discovered and captured by Deep Blue Fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering three stars, it means that the efficiency of this meditation is more than ever. When the stars are all integrated into the magic, two more stars are lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised and happy, but this was unprecedented efficiency, so he captured the two stars again and put them into their magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, when the starburst flutters in the magical misty sea, it passes through the blood of the elf, so it is absorbed by the natural affinity of the trunk. Then the elf blood began to increase at a very slow speed. This speed is very slow, so slow that even Richard's precise talent is difficult to distinguish the difference, just rely on the disappearance of the starburst to determine which side of the blood has been enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its significance is extremely significant, which means that Richard can choose to strengthen what kind of blood! Although only succeeding this time, it is not completely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
