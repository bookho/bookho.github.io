For those of us, my god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin exclaimed, let Richard I was shocked and somehow inexplicable. The praise of Light is his work, and what kind of function is naturally clear. Richard doesn't think there is anything in this ability to make Martin so rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the praise of light is completely a chicken rib in the eyes of Richard. In addition to turning various energies into light, there is no prominent place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took this over, but in fact it is the ability to increase the light of the gods. Such a single function, and can not be said to be a special installation, there is really little value in the eyes of Richard. However, it has a magical soul, so the requirements for carrying capacity are indeed the fifth-order construction level. This in turn detracts from the praise of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin tried to input a fascinating power into the structure, and saw a very pure light floating on the surface, and the face immediately became extremely complicated, looking to Richard I glanced at it and said, "How did you find this secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret?" Richard did not understand what Martin was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin sighed and shook his head and said, "It’s all destiny, it’s fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Martin suddenly relaxed and said, "Nothing, you will know one day later. But this little thing is very useful. I have never known how to get the old guy of the pope. Now there is a way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this related to the Pope?" Richard asked. Anything that is related to the mysterious Pope guarantees that there is no simple matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin laughed and said, "Nothing! What do you want to do for a while, what do you want to say? What is this called?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call it the praise of light. You can also change the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Legend of Light! Yes, this name is very good, no need to change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked and walked, and soon entered the Great Hall of the Holy Glory. Martin took the Richard Trail and walked to the back hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of St. Hui was magnificent and simple. As soon as he entered the hall, Richard felt a sense of depression and instinctively lowered his voice instinctively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this great shrine, I don’t know how many big things happened and yīn. If the sediment of history is strong enough, it will have the power to shock the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking through the hall, Martin took Richard through a long corridor. There is no decoration in the corridor, low and dark, every far away, there will be a magic light swaying, releasing a faint light. From the outside, Richard could not think of such a passage in the magnificent and solemn temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the passage, Martin pushed open a wooden door and walked in with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a windowless temple, small in size, with no extra decorations in addition to the altar and the glory of the Lord God. There are two rows of wooden benches in front of the altar. The chair and armrests have been very smooth. It seems to have been around for a long time and is often used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On each side of the altar, there is a wooden door. One of the doors is open, and through the door you can see that it seems to be a small library. The same area is small, the wooden bookshelf is old in style, with a row of ancient books on it. I am afraid that any one of them has a history of hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin pointed at the wooden bench and took Richard to sit down and wait quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is somewhat unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, another closed wooden door opened and the pope came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment the door opened, Richard saw a meditation room behind the door and connected to the bedroom. Every room is small and the furnishings are extremely simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope walked to the statue of the Lord of the Glorious, silently prayed for a while before turning around and looking to Richard, saying, "You are here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard stood up and suddenly did not know what to say. He said, "I originally wanted to fight with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Pope carefully looked at Richard for a while, shook his head and said: "Now is not the time. You must have heard Martin say that your fighting style is restrained by me, although you have defeated the undecided Queen. But that Doesn't mean that the world is invincible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and said slowly: "I seriously thought that you can really restrain my place, that is Soul and will. If I pay enough attention to this, you may not be able to succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope suddenly smiled a little and said: "I have not succeeded. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard, suddenly there was a very strong jǐng mega, and even smelled the death of the rich! He was shocked and immediately activated multiple shields to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the shield was formed, Richard suddenly felt that something seemed wrong. At this time, Li’s eye foreground suddenly turned back, just as time went back at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was shocked and found that the Pope had just pushed the wooden door out and walked out of the meditation room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned his head and looked at St. Martin, only to see that St. Martin was still sitting on the bench and looked at himself helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood that the scene he had just seen, and the dialogue with the Pope, did not happen at all, just an illusion! When was the move, Richard was completely ignorant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "Look, I said that you will be restrained by this old guy, don't lie to you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the pope in the heart and looked at the pope in front of the glory of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope stood in front of the statue and prayed silently for a while, turning and said to Richard: "You are here."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and immediately took two steps and looked at the pope. For a time, he couldn’t tell the difference between the illusion and the reality. After knowing that the Pope had just finished the conversation, everything would return to the time when the Pope came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world seems to have suddenly fallen into an infinite loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard’s surprise was only a moment, and he suddenly started the power to destroy his real name, and his body began to emerge with a blue fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the original calm face of the Pope suddenly changed, his hands waved continuously, and one after another, the Holy Light Shield emerged. But instead of protecting yourself, it was thrown at the idols, altars, libraries, and even the wooden benches that Richard had sat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Pope wants to protect everything in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin also hurriedly shouted: "Richard, stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee smiled slightly, The blue fire didn't emanate, but it didn't go away. It just slowly drifted around the body, and then calmly said: "It seems that I am not so easy to be restrained, isn't it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin has a look of ambiguity, and glanced at the blue fire flowing through Richard, saying: "Who knows that you can control the flame of the Star of Destruction! Let your damn When the flame is put away, even if it is radiated by the heat of this flame, it will cause permanent damage to the things in this room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue fire like a stream of water slowly returns to the body. He embraced his arms and looked into the room and said, "Is this house very precious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie said with a smile: "Very precious, But it can be said that it is of no value. In the eyes of our believers, everything here is a sacred object. Before the glory of the Lord ignited the fire, I lived here for a long time. Everything here was used by the Lord. But they are not as powerful as the Glorious Wand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of Li relaxes, the Pope chooses to meet here, it looks at least There is no idea of ​​a big fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin also said to the pope: "Do you think I am right? Richard is not so good."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin took a holy script from the altar, turned it over in his hand, surging the Holy Spirit in his hands, and then glanced at the page, suddenly said to Richard: "You Do you still don't know why you want to fight this old guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "This is right. The old guy’s most proud experience is to go to a dark area and then come back alive, maybe What you need to know is this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe. I need to know how to survive if I am in a dark area, how can I come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said slowly: "I don't think there is a need to tell you. Since we have already seen it, then you can already go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei sneered, and there was a blue fire on his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin coughed and took out a box with a light tribute and said to the pope: "Maybe you should look at this before making a decision." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin opens the lid to reveal the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope just glanced at the box and suddenly changed his face and suddenly reached out and grabbed the box! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Martin suddenly put the box on, and the Pope’s hand was stiff in the air, constantly trembled. He did not enter, but he was unwilling to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing, isn't it?" The Pope's voice is a bit distorted, and I can see his excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! This bright tribute can turn any power into light! Pure light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Pope murmured: "No, this is impossible! How can there be such a thing? This kind of thing should not appear at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Shrugging: "How do I know this? If you are interested, you can ask Richard. This thing is what he made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope looks at Lee Check, breathing a bit heavy, ask: "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can you give me?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
