If it was not the face of the proverb, he would rush on it at the moment. He did not believe that Richard could really be under the siege of many hunters and Druids. Live down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the wind and looked at the wind, just looking at the proverb elder, said: "Lin Hai is so big, the tree of life can be many, but also very few. However, the world tree can indeed be more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence suddenly shocked the three elves in the presence, which they never thought deeply. The problem, especially the world tree, can be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world tree is the final stage of the tree of life, and each tree of life has its own sphere of will, which is actually the territory required for the tree of life to absorb nutrients. The more evolved the tree of life, the greater the range of territories needed, but even the tree of life that evolved to the final stage of the complete body requires only a thousand kilometers of land. For the boundless forest, this is indeed true. It is a very small place. The world tree and the tree of life are completely different stages. It seems that the sphere of influence of the world tree seems to have no limit, but the two proverbs and the sons of the forest are very clear, and the will of the world tree is also covered. Limited, but the world tree can expand its will with the help of the will of the forest, but this is simply to expand the scope, and does not make much sense for the growth of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of Richard’s plane is close to 20,000 kilometers from the world tree. At such a long distance, the influence of the world tree is negligible, so the guardian will In the battle near the door of the plane, the death and injury were heavy. Without the protection of the world tree and the forest will, the strength of the guardian elf was at least 40% weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what Richard said is actually possible, only in the known forest range, it is possible to accommodate the growth of five or six world trees, and Li I have calculated it in detail. In the current range of forests, at least twelve world trees can be planted. This is his final plan for the development of the whole green forest: the life tree is moved to a designated place, and then all cultivated into a world tree. And here to rebuild the Elf Empire, Richard certainly can't build autonomous kingdom for the guardian elves, but hopes to use Greenson's space resources to reproduce the elite units that are difficult to copy in the era of the High Elf Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Ye couldn't stand it anymore. A sword stabbed to Richard's throat. His sword was moved. There were dozens of lines in the field of vision, indicating all the attack trajectories of the wind blade. If Richard's wisdom talent can Further advancement, not only can analyze all possible attack trajectories, but also instantly determine which trajectories are the most likely attack lines based on the known information of the opponent, but now, against the sacred level of the wind blade The son of the forest is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long knife moonlight has already jumped into the hands of Richard in silence, and then Richard’s simple long knife sneaked out and pierced the sword The countless flying leaves, pointing at the chest of the wind blade, the blade did not enter in an instant, the wind blade braked all over the body, incredulously looked down at the long knife on the chest, the whole body up and down to stimulate, illusion of countless flying leaves Then, one by one, Feng Ye has tried his best to stop his own momentum, and even he will not hesitate to reverse the vindictive and recoil. Because he rushes forward, it is equivalent to putting his body on Richard’s knife. However, the moonlight blade refers to his natural heart nucleus. It is the unique organ of the son of the forest. It is more important than the heart. Therefore, the wind blade has tried its best. Because of the fierce fighting, the small cracks began to appear on the organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of Fengye’s life threatening, there was a sudden spread of power behind him, pulling him back, finally avoiding the end of the process, the shot The elders who rarely spoke, after he saved the wind, couldn’t help but glance at Richard. Richard held a long knife and did not move. It seems that he would have come to save people until the wind. The leaves were pulled open and Richard recovered the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Hai is dead, Feng Ye is the son of the forest of the Jade Leaf Tribe. Although he is arrogant, he has the same strength as arrogance. He did not expect him to be angry. Richard’s knife almost forced him to commit suicide. This kind of martial arts is no longer described as terrible. The proverbs of the proverbs have even seen one level deeper. Richard’s knife has not much strength, and the speed is like electricity. The knife path is simple and clear, and Richard is putting the long knife there, and then the blade hits himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders’ eyes twitched slightly and said slowly: “It’s so powerful, we really can’t stay with you, so, your proposal, we will seriously consider However, it is necessary to have a Presbyterian meeting. It may take some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I can wait."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders clicked a bit, waved their hands, and the slang hunters and Druids who were ambushing around followed him to leave. Lin Haizhong once again quieted down, and Richard stood in the same place and pondered for a while. I turned and ran to the Yongye tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yongyue tribe is still dark, and the moonlight flower does not provide much light. The flowering period of this moonlight flower is not long, and it can only bloom for half a day. In the past, this is certainly not a problem. Where do you need moonlight in the daytime? But now is always night, so more than half of the moonlight has exhausted life and began to wither. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked into the village of Yongye Elf and stopped in front of a moonlight flower. This is a flower like an inverted bell. The size of the wine glass, inside it is hidden dozens of fireflies, emitting a soft light with a light green in the milky white, can illuminate a range of about three meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the high elves are works of art, and it is no wonder that they are so arrogant, perhaps arrogant and extreme, and their source of inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not notice that the night elves were a little more upset. He stood in front of the moonlight for a while before he sighed and called a passer. The Everlasting Elves said, "Let everyone pack up and get ready. After a few hours, we will move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf one The face was shocked, but did not dare to ask, flying to inform the Druid and the Sanctuary hunters, the affairs of the tribe, or they said it, after a while, Ellie came forward and asked: "How? Suddenly I have to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a bit and said: "The negotiations have failed. They are estimating that they are gathering strength. We are going now and we can win one. Two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, if you move like this, the casualties will be great, and..." Ellie looked at the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quiet and says: "People are more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice Nodded, returned to the middle of the knights, began to convene them to pack up, ready to go, she has carefully considered the plan to migrate back to the base city, roughly estimated the possible casualties, at the most critical juncture, in people and life Only one party can be kept between trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elves also began to pack their bags. Many elves would lie on the ground when they left the tree house. Finally, they kissed the green space under their feet and sniffed the dirt. The atmosphere, this land is connected with their blood, but now they have to give up, some of the night elves actually want to stay, and live together with this land, but in the past few days in the Great Druid and Melin Under constant persuasion, they all agreed to the migration. In the new place, the new tribe needs every elf. After all, the population base directly affects the future development speed of the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Richard also had only one sigh. If he said that he would have a little hope of talking with the proverbs, then after the meeting, the last hope was also shattered. Throughout the negotiation process, from beginning to end. The two sides did not mention Iskra, and Richard knew that he could no longer hesitate. If he missed an hour, it would mean an extra hour of hard work. Now under the entire tree of life, he can discern the direction under the cohesive forest will. It was only Richard himself and the sacred unicorn, so there was a great army in Richard, but he could not be contacted at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Yongye Life Tree migrates to the forward base within 500 kilometers, it is safe, at this distance, Richard can mobilize the defense, can Use your own tree of life to fight against the will of the forest. If the time is longer, the nest will have an endless stream of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this part of the road, but it is very difficult to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of night elves are still packing their luggage, they patiently and meticulously sort out many pieces of fine and delicate things, those little things may not be useful, but Richard But knowing that for a particular elf, they are actually very important souvenirs, so despite the precious time, Richard did not urge, but also stopped several knights who came to urge, and Richard is ready to give them half a hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, behind Richard, Melin’s melancholy voice: “Are we really going to leave?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but looked at the tree of life. The tree of life at night is shaking at this moment. The canopy that opens like an umbrella cover slowly gathers, and the thick trunks are swaying regularly. The surrounding land is constantly arched and cracked, and a large root must be slowly pulled out of the soil. The tree of life has begun the process of migration. Once this process begins, it cannot be interrupted until it finds a new place. Rooted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline suddenly whimpers and whispers: "I don't want to go, really have to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Richard is also sighing heavily in his heart. If there is still a choice, he would rather give up the development of Green Sen, compromise with all the guardian spirits, and let the Yongye tribe stay on this land. For many years, it is also the land where the people who have paid for their lives have to protect. For this commemoration, Richard is willing to give up most of the benefits here, money can always be earned, but the number of relatives is getting less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is willing to do this, does not mean that his warrior is willing to do so, Richard is a lord, the lord not only has rights and interests, but also heavy The responsibility, every warrior and the people, is Richard’s responsibility to give up the interests of Green Forest, and also to reduce the interests of His Majesty’s soldiers and the people in disguise. Richard has found that it is increasingly difficult to find and meet The way everyone is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
