			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knights are unusually strong, each one is close to two meters five. The body can be compared to a strong orc. The horse is also very tall, even if it is the head of the Knights of the Temple, it is barely close to the horse. No matter how close the hundred kilograms of the two-handed sword or the giant axe, in the hands of the black knight, there is no weight at all. Seeing the tricks they use will know, mostly sweeping, dancing, blocking, and even very Use less pricks. However, as long as these heavy weapons encounter something, whether it is a person or a weapon, it is not a momentary break or a flight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two older wizards also walked out of the portal, the battle began to reverse. The two magicians saw the battlefield situation, and even the shot was two six-level acid mist! And the range covered by the acid mist is not to avoid the black knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the magic, the air instantly began to fill the yellowish green fog, covering nearly half of the battlefield. As soon as the mist touched the skin, it immediately sizzled and it was obvious that a small blisters could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple shouted loudly and screaming, trying to exclude the acid mist. However, the ordinary soldiers, even the six or seven veterans or junior officers do not have this ability, the biting pain makes them unable to scream, but the acid mist immediately began to push the throat. In an instant, the soldiers were in a mess, and their eyes were eroded by acid mist, and they became red, and they could not help but shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knights are all rising in vindictiveness, unwittingly plunging into the fog, wielding weapons to create a puffy blood and limbs or Fragments of other things. And those different horses are also free to move, obviously not afraid of sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the range of sour fog, it becomes a one-sided slaughter in an instant! The priest in the distance was extremely angry, and forced a scepter. As the spell was completed, a sacred radiance emerged from his fingertips and landed in the center of the acid mist. After reaching the designated position, this brilliance suddenly erupted, turning into a very strong glare ball, and the sacred power of the drum caused a strong wind of rotation, blowing away a large amount of acid mist. But it was this time of breathing a few times, and more than a dozen soldiers and two knights were cut down. Although the acid mist is dispelled, the acid droplets that have been stained on the warrior's skin are still corroding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the pastors are more busy, healing, dispelling, purifying, and one by one, but the battle is more desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal suddenly stood still for a few seconds, and the light curtain slammed up and spurted a thick black mist. The black fog is indefinite, and there are a few roars of beasts from inside! Then suddenly squashed, condensed into a female knight sitting across the black behemoth in the air. She gently patted the neck of the behemoth, and the giant beast stretched out and fell lightly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, people feel the huge beast. It is a lion-like Warcraft, two long sword teeth from the upper lip, the thick mane flying without wind, it is extremely powerful. When it stood up straight, it was even taller than the black knights, but the landing posture, the incomparably huge body has unimaginable strange and light. The dark scales of the piece appear on the back of the piece, extending all the way to the tail, narrowing all the way, and the end is similar to the needle of the appendix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast sits on the back of the neck with a female knight, and the figure is also slightly petite in normal humans. Sitting on this giant beast The body is like a doll. She has a black armor, a black cloak, and even black hair and black eyes. She is very harmonious with the behemoths and even the surrounding black knights. However, the black armor on her body, the defensive power and special features are still unknown, but the peculiarity lies in the area. This armor is more exposed than the armor of the blood paladin Samma. If the arm guards and boots are not considered, the overall coverage is not even comparable to a set of underwear. In addition to the thin and thin leaves of the chest and lower abdomen, it is almost naked/body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
