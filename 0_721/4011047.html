			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the quiet forest was awakened by the fierce battle. The wind sent the sound of the warfare to all corners of the quiet forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famous elf warrior walked out of the tree house where he lived and listened to the sound coming from the wind. Then they returned to their hut, quickly dressed in armor, put on long swords, picked up longbows, bid farewell to their wives and family, left the quiet village where they lived, and rushed to the direction of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Elf King Theo is convening his warriors to fight powerful and evil enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of high elf warriors assemble from all corners of the quiet forest to the world tree. In the battle number, only senior soldiers of level 10 or above will hear the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment around the world tree, a large group of horned eagle is hovering. They are the mounts of the High Elf. The guards of Theo. Yangs will take the horned eagle and go to the shoreline with the Great Elf King to meet the ferocious enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theo. Yang God put on a gorgeous glass-like armor, carrying his famous legendary two-handed sword, and then embarked on his own mount. , a white peacock with several long tail feathers. This white peacock also has legendary strength and is one of the top ten beasts in the Elf King Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of the White Peacock, a large group of horned eagle circled around the world tree for the last week and flew away to the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samui is the second largest port on the east coast of the Elven Empire and the base of the Elf King’s Third Fleet. The third fleet stationed here is responsible for the coastal defense in the northeast. Nearly 100,000 high elves live on Koh Samui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samui is only a few tens of kilometers from the mainland, and it is opposite the White Sand City, a city named after the beautiful white sand beach. But now, the whole of Samui is a panic, the third fleet that has played has no news, on the contrary, a fleet of seven giant ships. But it appears outside the Soviet Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port’s guards were easily defeated, and all remaining warships were either captured or sunk. There are terrible shooters on the ship, they can shoot powerful magical tracking arrows nearly a thousand meters away. Even the high-level elf strongman at the Sanctuary level will fly into the battleship and will be instantly shot as a hedgehog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard spent an hour cleaning up and occupying Port of Samui. The occupation of White Sand City was easier, and there was no decent garrison in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spoiled rebellion was suppressed, the high elves quieted down and silently watched Richard’s army receive a strategic location. The same silent night elves force, let the high elves in the fear, but also a little more curiosity. This is an army with a minimum of 16 levels. Any soldier in it can go to the Imperial team as an elite officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elves are of a high level, well-equipped, and even overwhelmed the Guardian of the Elf Wang Ting, which is a real big man of Wang Ting, such as Said theo. Yang God, their guards have this level. However, the guards of the Great Elf King are only a few dozen people, and at most hundreds of them. How can it be like Richard? Is it a thousand night elves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Goshawk, Mina and others walked around in Port of Samui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings here are all in the style of the Elven Empire. The overall architecture is slender and high. The city is full of ancient trees and flower beds, just like forests. The houses are spires, covered with turquoise or blue glazed tiles, while the borders are often made of gold or dark gold and silver. This kind of gold, or the combination of silver and blue, is the mainstream aesthetic of the Elf Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher elves are taller and more coordinated and robust than their distant relatives in Noland, such as the Prairie Elves and the Wind Elves. The height of the male high elves is close to two meters, a little higher than Richard. And women are often around one meter eight. The tall and harmonious shape allows the high elves to combine speed and strength. At the same time, they have a natural magical affinity, a close relationship with the world tree, and a high elf with a druid between the priest and the mage. Unique career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s appearance does not only mean that there is a strong caster, their most important significance is to make up for the lack of the number of gods and priests in the temple. . Thus the army of the higher elves has superhuman assistance and recovery power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a round trip in the port city of Samui, and has seen the entire city. He also looked at several shops and returned. The port, boarded its own battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the harvest?" Goshawk asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said: "Have you found out that the most shops in the city are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk also has an unforgettable memory, and now recalls, It says: "The bookstores are the most, and there are also a lot of shops selling all kinds of artworks. I also count the shops that make art processing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are a lot of weapons processing shops here, but most of them are decorated for weapons, not to increase the lethality. For example, this sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard showed a long sword. The sword was randomly drawn from a weapon processing shop and was the most common weapon among the high elves. The long sword Jianfeng is long and sharp, and the workmanship is quite good. But the most intriguing is the Elven text engraved on the ridge of the sword, and the beautiful sword shaped like a bird's wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is a famous verse, and the beautiful shape of the sword is just to make the whole sword look more complicated and gorgeous, and has no other function. This sword light should cost more than a magic weapon, but it is not yet enchanted. A weapon without enchantment is no more difficult to compare with the killing power of a magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current scale of the industry under Richard’s name can be compared with the entire kingdom, and his grasp of the value of goods is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Lei bounced the blade and said: "That is to say, two-thirds of the cost of the sword is used in these and the lethality itself." There is no relationship. This sword is a window, let us see that the Elf Empire is not as powerful as they think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very Ordinary long swords, almost every adult high elf will wear a hand. It is not only a symbol of identity, but also a practical weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult high elves are good fighters, and their elite units have an average rating of 12. This is also the foundation of the entire Elland and the Greenland. Only then did the various ethnic coalitions overwhelm the elf's army in numbers, which overthrew the rule of the elf empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sword in his hand, the Goshawk also reached the same conclusion and couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the memory of the Goshawk, the weapons of the Elven Empire are not so flashy. The weapons of that period are still luxuriously decorated, but from the material to the enchantment are very elegant, it is indeed a powerful magic weapon. Because the high elves have limited fertility and a small number of troops, they can use expensive magical weapons as standard equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vast green continent, it is obvious that magical weapons are still scarce, because the number of elf wizards and magic craftsmen is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Blue Moon, Richard looked at the time and ordered the entire fleet to leave Hong Kong and prepare for the battle. The defenders stationed in Baisha and Koh Samui also gathered in the fortifications and prepared to strictly observe them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said to the goshawk: "The elf's reinforcements are coming, we are likely to see a big elf king this time. No, this is just The documents found in the port, we killed at sea, but the Elf Royal Court Third Fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the elf is coming, are you ready to talk or fight?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is playing." Richard said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Goshawk frowned. He is from the Millennium Empire, and his blood and growth background is always an indescribable emotion to the Elven Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of him, the elf blood is not necessarily younger than his thin young lord but smiles: "These high elves must know how much we are, they are Will be in the right attitude. The modest modesty is cowardice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshen also wants to persuade Richard, suddenly sensed the tyrannical momentum in the distance, Immediately changed his face and turned to look to the west. On the sky, a black bird crushed a group of birds, and the first beautiful white peacock was particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the goshawk felt the undisguised killing machine on the white peacock, the heart immediately sank, knowing that there is no possibility of peaceful resolution. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, a news that shocked the entire green continent spread to Elf Wang Ting. Keeping the northeastern empire of the empire, Theo Yang God, one of the top ten elders of the Elven Empire, died! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He personally killed the Theo. Yang, the Li, who led the 5,000 under the ship landing, captured the quiet forest, and then all the way to the elves Wang Ting came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And until Theo. Yang God died, a message that has been detained in the East was sent to Elf Wang Ting. The intruder named Richard, who is said to be carrying the twig of the Golden World tree, wants to exchange the same thing with the Elf Wang Ting, specifically what the other party did not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
