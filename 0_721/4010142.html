			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Norland’s great sensation perceives the fluctuations in the plane of the plane, when she rushes in, she sees that Richard is sitting on the ground Rough, a magic box that is faster than others is thrown aside. Just in the place where Richard is not far away, Gangde simply squatted directly on the ground, and the strong body was covered with oily sweat. The three large bounded magic boxes that were tied together fell to him, just to see the volume of the three sealed magic boxes, and Nolan felt that some legs were soft. The strength of Gangde is amazing, but the back of such a large three-boxed magic box is not only to stimulate the blood and the strength of the construction, but also to add the magical and magical effects in advance. As a result, he was directly involved in the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another, the Archimonde warriors came out of the transmission array, and they all carried the overwhelmed magic box, and everyone just walked out of the transmission array. They have fallen down. Finally, from the transmission array is the drifting sand, but even she also carried a small sealed magic box, so that Nolan was so surprised that his mouth could not be closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" Nolan released the vitality to the quicksand for the first time, then grabbed Richard's collar angrily and directly lifted him from the ground. Get up, roaring: "You can't bring one more person back? Let the sand flow carry the box!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich is reporting a charming smile, Said: "The beautiful Nolan big god officer, the plane transmission is very expensive. One more person will have to pay 40,000 more transmission costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Nolan is also arrogant, his hands are getting tighter, and he is angry: "A royal builder, you have to save 40,000 gold coins in this area?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiled even more charmingly, saying: "The savings are given to the sand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Nolan feels like I can't get angry. But she was still somewhat reluctant, glaring at Richard for a while, and then let him down. Inadvertently, the body-shaped Nolan once again showed an amazing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan turned to the sand and asked: "Run sand, how long can you stay this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "2 days." Liu Sha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan frowned and said, "So short? There is an intermediate sacrifice after seven days. If you want to stay for a few more days, I will give the opportunity to host the sacrifice." For you. You need grace now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand Shake shook his head and said, "No, you can only stay for up to two days. Don't worry about my grace. This time, Richard brought back the sacrifice and can hold a sacrifice tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at Richard unexpectedly, his eyes softened a lot. Said: "So there are sacrifices so soon? It seems that this little guy is quite capable. Well, then I don't worry. Flowing sand, Vatican's great priest said that when you come back, I will see her once. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the drifting sands, Nolan was able to release the energy of the exhausted Archimonde one by one, so that they could recover faster. Richard handed over the ore and metal of the two magic boxes to Nolan, which was exchanged for nearly a million gold coins. This time, Richard asked Nolan to convert 200,000 of them into 400 magic crystals, and spent 300,000 to purchase 100,000 enchanted arrows. The rest are replaced by gold coins. Due to limited time, Nolan has only hired more than a dozen ten-level mages. The value of the forged black shovel ingot brought back by Richard is slightly lower than that of the cloud iron, but far above the Lafite iron. After the enchantment, this metal is dedicated to the weapons of the high-level knight. The iron ingots that Richard brought back were worth 500,000. If they are all enchanted, they need to work on this mage for two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan watched as Richard directed the Archimonde soldiers to sort out and carry the supplies. When she saw the forged black shovel, she was very surprised. Unexpectedly, in addition to Yun Tie, Richard also got another source of high-grade metal materials. In the end, Nolan couldn't help but set the black scorpion iron after the enchantment and was willing to pay all the money in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still more than a dozen unopened magic box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee opened up ten of them again, and Nolan’s face changed instantly. In the magic box, a variety of weapons are piled up in a dense manner. Only the dark black is like a flowing luster. Nolan knows that these weapons are all special products made of forged black stellite. Although these weapons are not yet enchanted, the price of each sale will be around 5,000 gold coins. Seeing a full ten boxes of black iron weapons, Nolan still felt that his breathing was somewhat difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan picked up a wide-blade dagger and examined it carefully. The dwarf's craftsmanship certainly couldn't escape her eyes, and it also made the weapons worth more. Added a few points. Nolan couldn't help but ask: "What is the total number of weapons made by these black and iron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the sweat from his forehead and said : "Four hundred pieces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four hundred!" Although there was speculation, but heard such a number was confirmed, Nolan's voice still trembled. Even the great priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall, facing the wealth of two million gold coins, will still touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to deal with this batch of weapons? Is there anything I can help with?" Nolan asked. She and the channels behind it can easily digest millions of metal minerals, but a total of two million weapons are beyond her capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to attach magic effects to them, then take them back to Faro to sell them," Richard said. Nolan nodded and said, "I can find a way to help, but it is not the area I am good at. If you don't have the right channel, then before you leave." I can come back to find me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you! I want to give you a hug!" Richard grinned, but there was a special strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan turned his face slightly red, snorted, pointing to the two remaining magic boxes on the ground, and asked: "What is inside?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated, or opened one of the magic boxes to reveal the weapons inside. This box contains the best from the hands of Bamore, and is also the embryo of the epic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan saw the weapons at first sight and exclaimed: "Epic embryo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time she can no longer hold it, but directly picks up a two-handed warhammer and looks at it inch by inch. This hammer has a hammer face on one side and a nail on the other. The nail tip and the tip of the hammer end flashed an unusual cold light. This is not the glory of magic, but the display of the craftsmanship of the forge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the embryo of the epic weapon, and if you pass the skill of the superb master of magic, there is also a very small probability of a legendary weapon. The forging skills of these five weapons are top notch even if they are placed in Noland. In the dwarf forging process, Noland is not much stronger than Faro. On the contrary, Noland, who has a very high level of magic, lacks this high-end embryo. Each of these five weapons can be easily sold for 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total price of these five weapons is far less than the just four hundred weapons, but the feeling for Nolan is different. What Li showed in front of the resources is the most enviable of the richness of the space he is in. However, these five epic embryos show that Richard has been integrated into the plane, and that the success and the high-end strength of the plane are close. contact. This means that the plane war has entered the second phase. But how long did Richard enter the Faro plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan puts the two-handed warhammer into the box and puts his eyes on the last box. She has an instinct, and the last box will definitely give her a very strong shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li saw the hope of Nolan, hesitated a little, and went to the box of the magic box, put his hand on the lid, but did not rush to open, but Looking up to Nolan smiled and said: "Sense is telling me that it should not be opened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Richard has opened the box of the magic box cover! Inside the magic box, there is a block of dark crystals, large or small, and a rich maple leaf aroma has been spilled in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan paused for a moment, only a moment later, whispered softly, "The best maple amber..." This box of maple amber, at least worth six Seven million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly closed the magic box cover, blocking Nolan’s line of sight, and smiled and waved in front of her, drawing her sight to herself. Come on. Nolan came back to this moment. When he looked at the look of Richard, he suddenly fainted his face and gnawed his teeth. "Little guy! You are interested in seeing my jokes? Are you looking for death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any legal person who suddenly sees so many of the best Maple Amber, will be somewhat disappointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and came to the default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan bit his lip and hate and say: "I see you really want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha laughed and waved the soldiers to lift the box and walked out of the hall. Before leaving the hall, he suddenly turned back and smiled at Nolan: "This matter, ask the quicksand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, in the laughter Li Chayang went long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! Wealth is just wealth!" Nolan didn't understand why he suddenly said such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will turn it into power!" This is Richard's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Richard, Nolan suddenly had a moment of loss. In Richard, she seems to see the shadow of another man. She sighed and said to herself in a slightly undetectable voice: "Little guy... you, do it yourself, don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to the floating island, the old housekeeper was called in the first time, ready to listen to some of the latest news in the family territory. As he flipped through the information on the family plane, he listened absently. After all, from the last time I came back, Norland had only ten days, ten days, what could happen. On the contrary, several large private planes are more involved in Richard's nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old housekeeper said, but Richard was a glimpse, suddenly raised his head and said, "What? There is a tax on the land that is not received." Half of the original?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Sir Kunda said that the reason for the lack of tax is the banditry in the territory, and the two consecutive taxes were robbed. The sake of the plunder," said the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
