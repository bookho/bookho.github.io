			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard walked out of the plane of Greenson’s plane, and then transmitted in a continuous plane, entering the outer edge of the Golden World Tree, that is The border of the night elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the forest. The forest here is completely different from the original forest of the plane, and it is far from the mark of this world. It has a gold world tree of nearly a thousand meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light from the crown of the world tree has driven away the dampness and cold of the original forest, bringing a warm world like a fairy tale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are grasslands and mountain flowers in the forest. I will see squirrels and hares running through, and the beautiful brown-red deer will jump in front of Richard in a brisk pace. Over. These are extremely docile species, and there is no attack of wild Warcraft, like the nourish species of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a few small figures ran out of the forest. It was a few young night elf kids who were just over a meter tall. They are chasing and playing, and they are squandering the simple happiness that childhood has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until about to hit Richard, they discovered the existence of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several elves immediately stunned, watched Richard with vigilance, and slowly retreated. Their movements are not fast, but they can explode strength and speed at all times. From this detail, these little guys have a very good combat instinct, at least much stronger than the children of the same age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, he smiled and reached out to a few little guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his palm, a small group of pale green light is spinning and beating, with a rich and pure life and natural atmosphere. This is a deadly appeal to the elves. The little faces of a few little guys wrinkled in a hurry, their eyes struggled, and they couldn’t do without the light ball in Richard’s hand. However, they did not immediately rushed up, which made Richard a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that these night elves are really a natural fighting race, even children have such strong self-control, able to resist the temptation of natural affinity from the race . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a breeze blew in the forest, and a looming figure appeared in the treetops of the forest, and the arrow that shone with a pale blue light quietly pointed to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s ability at this time, he felt that there was a slight acupuncture on the naked/exposed skin, which indicated that Lee Arrow also had some threats to him. Of course, it is one thing to have a threat, and the size of the threat is one thing. In the face of these at least Sanctuary-level shooters, if Richard does nothing, it is possible to be scratched by the hard block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A somewhat older night elf appeared on the canopy more than ten meters away and said, "Who are you! Why do you appear?" Here? I warn you, don't mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was even more surprised, stood up and asked: "You don't know me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elf shooter pulled the bow more full, the arrow will be sent the next moment, and said: "Answer my question!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior of the night elf shooter has shown that they do not know Richard. In Richard's soul link, he did not find the location of these night elves. That means that these night elves are not under Richard's control, which is completely different from the previous night elf army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the night elves who surrounded him with interest and said, "I am Richard, it should be... yours God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense! Our God is Hilo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilo? Richard immediately remembered the special night elf, and the mother's nest was taken advantage of the shooters created by all the resources when the ascending order. In addition to the legendary level of strength, Hilo also has three powerful capabilities, such as extraordinary range, must, and space transition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the abyss battlefield, the face is full of fleshy devils, the environment is particularly suppressing the natural attributes of Hilo, so that The special night elf shooter did not have a special performance in the abyss journey. But when you switch to other places, like Calando, Hilo's power will be completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these night elves not only did not link with Richard’s soul, but also used Hilo as their own god. It seems that during the time when Richard struggled in the dark area, there were many things happening in Green Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These night elves, and the nests behind them, may even include the golden world tree, all... uncontrolled? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles still, but the light in his eyes is getting colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest does not strengthen its own combat power, it is to create more combat units, in front of Richard is like an undefended city. If Richard wants to destroy it, it has no way to save his destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps only its ontology, the power of the billionaire will make Richard feel tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to feel the mind of Richard, the holy moonlight emits a soft tweet, and the blade passes a cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice of the nest’s avatar finally sounded in the consciousness of Richard: “Master, everything you see is from the self and the golden world tree. Hand. If you have enough patience, I can explain it to you slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think this explanation is late? I am going to green. Sen has been around for a while." Richard replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally thought that I could talk to you about the current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Now that you know, you have successfully separated the soul from my control, just like you are out of the control of the ontology. So now you feel that you have a qualification to talk to me, is it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest was silent for a moment, saying: "It was originally like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee did not bring I smiled sullenly and said, "What about now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you come back from the dark area, everything is naturally different."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am going to see you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is silent for a moment, then : "As you wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later, Richard walked out of the portal and looked down at the huge insects below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is now a length of ten kilometers and a height of more than a kilometer. It is a hill that can be active. Within a few hundred kilometers of it, it has all been transformed into a nest forest, and countless worker bees are busy entering and leaving. Nearly 100,000 night elf warriors are sleeping deeply in hundreds of tall worm nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out from the perspective of Richard, you can also see the canopy of the distant gold world tree, a few sunshine shining on the body of the mother's nest, plating it It has a golden glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the smooth arrival of the mother's nest, it means that the mother's nest gave up the resistance, which made Richard's face slightly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the nest is even a deadly rebellion, it is completely useless in Richard’s eyes. Even the reapers can't rely on the number of dead Richards, and the hens are not the same. And in the place where Greenson has long been analyzed by Richard, the rules of the bottom are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting for your explanation." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the master, as a mother who can infinitely create combat units, I have my own dream: to be the creator of a new race..... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is telling an incredible story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a dream, or every independent soul has a dream. The dream of the nest is very unbelievable to Richard. The mission is to be born. The ultimate war weapon of destruction of life is divided, and the dream is to become the Creator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard fell into the darkness, two completely different world rules system cut off all connections between Richard and his mother's nest and followers. The hen's nest is also in a state of long-term unacceptable order. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard did not make a clear instruction, the ancestral avatar actually had considerable autonomy, and it was possible to decide for itself what troops to create and how much to create. The premise is to complete the preset commands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pre-set command that Richard gave to the hen's nest was to create and evolve an army dominated by night elves. The specific manufacturing ratio, how to evolve, when Richard can not communicate and discuss with the mother nest, it is necessary to be refined and designed by the mother nest. And the ability to split the mother's nest can be optimized for the deployment of combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestral avatar takes advantage of the space that can be freely played in the preset commands and begins to chase its own dreams. But to become a Creator, you first need to have your own soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ultimate difficulty, but it is the easiest part of the nest that can be separated from the ontology. With the help of the Golden World Tree, the Brood Broken has easily broken through Richard's control and has an autonomous soul. Of course, the interruption of its contact with Richard makes this difficulty greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the mother's nest began to be its great creation plan. The initial goal was set for the night elves who were actually quite perfect. As creatures, the night elves are even more perfect than the high elves. They are created by Richard when he is close to the super strong. At that time, Richard had begun to contact the rules of the world, and the rules of the Greenson's own plane were close to full control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night genie as a combat unit, the biggest flaw is that there is no soul. Without a soul, you cannot proliferate or become a real life. But this has been solved in the Golden World Tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden World Tree is the mother tree of the High Elves. It is not only the source of the elves' faith and power, but also the task of carrying some of the elf souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level elves who have reached a certain level of power will place some of their souls in the golden world tree. When they die, a new elf will inherit. This part of the soul, thus possessing some of the power of these elf powers. Obviously, these new generations of elves who have inherited the souls of their ancestors are so-called geniuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a unique way of inheriting the high elves. They don’t need to be alive and dead like the Terran and other races, and they can also produce super strong. There are four superpowers on the green continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the superpowers generated by this method are not comparable to the superpowers of the Terran, or even the Goshawks. Quasi-super strong can tie them with them. Not yet outstanding, Richard broke the myth of the invincible empire of the Emerald Empire, and even captured the world tree and the holy mountain, and fully exposed the incomparable nature of the high elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this way of inheritance solves the most fundamental difficulties in the mother's nest, the soul. The Golden World Tree can produce souls without life marks and inject them into the new night elves, filling in the final blanks for the entire creation plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
