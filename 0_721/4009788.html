			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nostalgia nodded, no wonder why Richard did not kiss his father. The inquiry process, like talking about a very common topic, naturally said: "There was very little historical data on the battle. At that time, the Marquis of Gordon was seriously injured at the last moment. His then adjutant led the troops to complete the remnants of the remnants. The elves and the royal family never surrendered, so there was no captive of the royal family in that war, but they caught many ordinary elves. They later became slaves to the royal family. However, the Marquis of Gordon never mentioned this in public. The battle, so there are not many records. In addition... To be honest, many people do not like Archimonde, naturally they are not willing to write this history."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case...Thank you, sand." Richard said very sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sands return the history of the Silver Moon Elf to Richard, but say: "If you have such a free time to look through history, then I suggest you take some time. Read a few notes that Vatican teacher gave you, which records a lot of knowledge about planes and time, and the teachings of the eternal and time dragons. It will be good for our journey. Or, if you Not interested in these, then I heard that you are a very good builder. For our future battles, I suggest that you can first look at what is suitable for me. When we stand firm in the new plane In the future, you will be able to tailor the magic pattern for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Construction?" Richard felt very surprised and looked at the eyebrows of the sand. Said: "Is this on your forehead not a special construction? If I am not mistaken, this construction actually has some powerful ability? This is the fourth-order construction."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I only have one build on my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fourth-order construction is not enough?" Richard laughed, but looked at the serious and serious eyes of the sand, and had to close his smile. A little thought, it reveals the shock that cannot be concealed. Q: "Can you carry more structures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying capacity of the fourth-order construction is almost ten times that of the initial construction. The fourth-order construction of the drifting sand has surprised Richard. . Any professional under the age of ten can be proud of being able to carry a third-order structure. Therefore, Richard did not think that the sand can actually carry more structures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, then you have to offend it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand said faintly: "This is fundamental Not an offense, don't have to worry about it, because if you can really make a suit that suits me, I will let you draw it directly on the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is slightly horrified and draws the structure directly on any part of the body. It is almost inevitable to be naked. Of course, the direct drawing is due to the omission of the plug-in, the requirements for the bearing capacity are relatively small, and the energy consumption of the carrier medium is not increased, and the mounting effect is also correspondingly improved. However, the improvement is basically within 5%, and it will be much more troublesome to replace the structure in the future, and it will suffer a lot of pain, taking into account the failure rate of the builder, the manual cost of drawing directly, etc. A series of factors, if not a high-level configuration, can get a larger absolute value, then there are not many people who choose to fabricate the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the sand does not mind, Richard does not think too much, but throws a reconnaissance as usual, and he is shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands, legs, arms, and the chest and lower abdomen showed strong magical fluctuations. Richard immediately judged that she might carry a lower-order fourth-order structure! This even subverts Richard's common sense of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influencing the strength of the knight, in addition to the carrying capacity, there are also the number of construction positions. Under the same total bearing capacity, the more the configuration position means the more components can be inserted. In general, the carrying capacity of the fourth-order configuration and the ten first-order configurations are roughly equivalent. However, the knights with ten reasonable initial-level configurations can basically determine that they can win only one fourth-order structure. Many of the knights, including some of the people on the mainland, were actually plagued by inadequate construction. For example, St. Peter's most famous armed forces in the world need the support of at least five construction positions, and there must be a large enough structure on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current quicksand has already shown six construction positions. And Richard himself has only two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up and said with a smile: "Some is beyond my ability, so I need to think about it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, there is still time, you can think about it slowly." After the sand was finished, he slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dozen hours of non-stop journey, the team finally arrived in Jumu Town. This is a very small town in the Earl of Goliath, in a remote location, next to the mountains and the endless virgin forest. The only specialty of Jumu Town is wood, but because of the material and transportation, it is impossible to bring much gold coins to the people in the town. There is very little trade without trade. No matter from which point of view, Jumu Town is an ordinary, poor and quiet town. There are only a hundred people in the town, and they have lived here for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the depths of the forest behind the giant wood town, it is a secret death training camp in Archimonde. This training camp has a history of 100 years, I do not know how many killers, evil wizards and warriors. There is no race, no occupation. Everyone who enters the death camp will receive training that suits their own characteristics. Then the only thing they need to do is to live and live until the end of the training period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death camps are mostly orphans, death row prisoners and slaves, as well as murderers and soldiers seeking excitement. There are even a lot of crazy Archimonde who voluntarily join the death camp in pursuit of more powerful power. However, all the students are treated equally. In the face of death, there is no difference between an Akmon family member and an orphan. If you want to live, you can only rely on strength or blackmail, or both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not here to be trained, but to pick the soul guard. This is also one of the resources that the family provides to the core people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soul Guard is to bind Richard and the soul of the Guard with the power of the soul contract. If the soul guard wants to betray, then the power of the contract hidden in his soul will easily tear his soul. On the other hand, if Richard is attacked by a soul, the soul guard will also share the damage, thus greatly increasing Richard's soul resistance. However, if a similar attack is a soul guard, Richard will not be injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power of the contract, the soul guard and the fate of the contract holder are completely bound together and are the most loyal guardians. However, the soul contract reel is extremely rare. So far, the biggest way to obtain the soul contract reel is the god of the Eternal Dragon Temple. The other method is the divine master who has reached the legendary realm. But every time you make a soul contract reel, you need to consume a lot of divine power, and permanently lose a small part of the soul power. If you first create a soul contract reel, you will be sure to drop from the legendary realm. Who is willing to do this kind of thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
