			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this evening, Richard made this preparation for trading. Commodities, two pieces of power that need to consume magic crystals are more simple to install than the hammers, and the increase is also controlled at around 15%. The two structures are shared with Richard for four hours and cost about 2,000 gold coins. A unit of magic crystal can launch the assembly ability 10 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening the elf poet Oral is also very busy, he is inlaid with two gems on the box of the magic box. There is no doubt that the craftsmanship of the elves is not too bad. Although the two boxes of the magic box used for the sealed structure will not affect their use, no matter how many stones are placed, Richard still makes Oral inlaid with more than one thousand gold coins for each box. The elf poet was somewhat puzzled at first, and then Richard's explanation made him admire the five bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of Richard is that there has never been a magic pattern in this plane, so the value of the structure is difficult to judge because of the lack of objective criteria. For those who have higher power and are closer to their own talent bottleneck, the value of the magic pattern is higher. Therefore, the role of these two boxes of magic is actually to provide an objective standard for the value of the value of the buyers who have never seen the magic pattern. If the packaged boxes are worth more than a thousand gold coins, how many times should the contents be worth several times? This is a habitual thinking of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the old man at the grocery store, Amman, sent someone to send an invitation to lunch with Richard, not far away. The hotel is famous for its variety of exotic dishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Amman, there are several other shopkeepers on the old street who have seen it. In addition, an obese and savvy big businessman Tiffman, and an unspeakable old man Clarke is the first time to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the introduction, Tiffman is the head of the Jinhui Battle Flag in the Blue Water Oasis and a member of the Oasis Parliament, with the highest status among the people in the room. Clark is said to be one of the tops of the Gun of the Devil. The Gun of the Demon Hunt is an armed group of adventure teams, slaves and mercenaries. Although there are only a few hundred members, each one has a good fighting power. And because the scale is not large, so come and go like the wind, turn into flexibility, is the object that even the big business group is not willing to easily offend. If the big business group has some unpopular tasks, such as destroying a certain caravan of competitors, then the demon gun will be one of the best choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, everyone first chilled, touted and tempted each other. Although Richard did not find out what new things were, he also let others have nothing. So everyone will understand that the old foxes who are able to sit here, no matter how old or young, are cautious. Perhaps Richard is too young because of his too young relationship, but his cautiousness is not worse than anyone else. He talks dripping without leaking any details about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many ordinary people are there? There is no need for Richard to reveal anything, and only a few things can be inferred from his temperament, knowledge, age, magic level, and many powerful and unique followers. In other words, if Richard is thirty, he will not be looked at by these people at all, but now that he is only sixteen or seven years old, there are no smart people who are willing to provoke him. Everyone in the room guessed everything, and some even speculated that behind Richard, in addition to a family that surpassed the Marquis, stood a legendary strongman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, their inference is very close to the truth, except for two points: First, Richard’s background is actually stronger than their most daring imagination; second All the backgrounds of Richard are not in this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After politeness, he began to get to the point. Clark first proposed to buy a scroll of magic, how much is how much. The purchase price is 10 gold coins for the first-level reel, 30 for the second-level reel, 90 for the third-level, 270 for the fourth-level, and so on. For every level of the magic scroll, the price will triple. This is a very reasonable price, but the applicability is generally up to the five-level scroll. Any of the six-level magic scrolls requires tens of thousands of gold coins, and the magic scrolls of six or more levels are not available for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of these smudged reels is much higher than the ordinary magic scrolls, because they cost a certain price, but they are all available to everyone. Ordinary magic scrolls must be used by clergy, which limits their use. Where can I find the priest of the true god or even the priest to cast the scroll in the land of blood? That is, their behavior must not exceed the realm of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whether it is a thief or a mercenary, if you are injured in a battle, you can only use holy water, drugs and other items to recover, in addition to relying on a strong physique . The effects of these restorations are far less than direct magical treatments, and because they are the only choice, the price is not cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the sands are robbed from the temple of the god of courage and the precious scrolls of the gods are precious. Originally, the sand can be used to cast five levels of magic, that is, you can make a three-level magic scroll, but only one can be made every day. But somehow, she changed the scribble on the magical scroll of the god of courage, and she could make a four-level magic scroll, and three can make three changes per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of smudge scroll that requires the life of the operator to pay for it is the kind that Clark is going to buy, making it easier to make, and sanding can make five in a day. One. According to the flow sand privately, this is because the power of the scrolls is mostly from the sake of the god of courage. Since she does not have to pay so much power, the natural scroll can be done much faster. Moreover, she vaguely revealed that the manufacture of such reels not only did not cause any loss, but was very good for her growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after hearing Clark’s offer, the image of the sand in the heart of Richard suddenly became a bit strange, she simply turned into a humanoid coin casting machine, every day can Create nearly a thousand gold coins. And now Richard is more interested in the temples of the gods, where there are almost countless scrolls of magic. Although the last shrine of the god of courage took away more than a hundred magic scrolls in two large boxes, it was less than one-third of the inventory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman is also very interested in this smudged scroll of magic, but he only needs four levels of powerful treatment and offers 300 gold coins for each reel. As long as 20. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard roughly guessed Tiffman’s intentions. A powerful warrior with a four-level smudge scroll is in the hand, which is equivalent to an extra life on the battlefield. It is quite normal for a senior business group like Tiffman to have a slave team in his own private. If the team is equipped with the corresponding reels, then the team's combat power will rise straight, and it can deepen the alien land and capture the rare races that can sell big prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Richard recognized the terms of the transaction and can sell it to Tiffman’s twenty four-level reels and sell it to Clark’s thirty-three Reels, and ten four-level reels. This is already the workload of nine days of running sand, and it is also the total inventory of her most recent time. Just for this transaction, Richard received nearly 10,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a large transaction, the relationship between the people is naturally harmonious. Even the most greedy person, seeing the smudged scrolls of God, also defaults to Richard's ability to retain his own property. The reason is very simple. If it is only a few reels, it may be that he has no intention of acquiring it. And such a large number of people, even if Richard does not deny the possibility of continuing to trade in the future, it will only come from the family or forces behind him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
