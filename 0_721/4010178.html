			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweating words will attract many creatures that rely on smell to track enemies! You Must learn to control." The white night ahead said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even more embarrassed, and quickly promised, carefully tightening the skin, distributing physical strength, and controlling the speed of the heart and blood flow. This requires a long training for others, and it will always be lost. But for Richard, with the foundation of the dark world, combined with the observation and imitation of the white night, with the help of real talent, he can quickly control the whole body up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not bad, learn very quickly." White night is hard to praise Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked through the mountain belly and walked for more than an hour. The white night said: "It’s safer now, you can slow down. I will tell you Let's take a look at the situation here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the night telling, Richard knows that the battlefield of the extant field is more than one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battlefield is called the dusk land. It was originally an unusually large and magnificent high-level plane, but it was simultaneously occupied by two main planes Nolan and Da Connected by Kesodas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the war, the civilization of this plane was destroyed by Noland and Dakso Das. Then, one day, in the center of the mainland of the plane, the two main planes met, and there was an earth-shattering battle! The war lasted for hundreds of years, and almost all of the indigenous life on the entire plane was already destroyed in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless strong people from the main plane who are constantly fighting in all corners of this continent. Their full strength is enough to move mountains and reclamation, and they are constantly harvesting. All kinds of natural resources on the plane. But the most serious damage to the plane is the legendary mages, who constantly extract the energy of the plane itself and turn it into a powerful horror magic, blasting to the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the dryness of the source energy of the plane, the vitality gradually disappears, and this plane gradually becomes dead, no longer suitable for the survival of low-level life. Although the plane itself has lost its value, it is connected to two main planes. In the long-term war, the planes on both sides have become extremely stable, and even cannot be easily broken, which becomes natural. battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the origin of the dusk of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the dusk, the portals of the two main planes are spread all over the mainland. Except for the several super forts built by the two sides, it can be said that any on the mainland The place is not safe, and it is possible to meet the other person at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both sides have found that the traditional army can’t beat the opponent, they are no longer sending ordinary cannon fodders, but the sacred domain is the main body. Wrestling with each other. This is the cruelest and most authentic form of the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you kill each other with the sacred domain as the main body? Is there any value worth occupying in this plane?" Richard asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground hills for so long, Richard rarely sees life, that is, there are some low-level life without wisdom. This is very different from the underground of Noland. Noland's underground dark world, but with a strong race and civilization that is not much weaker than the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Richard has not found any valuable minerals along the way. The underground dark river is quite a lot, but the river water flowing inside is rich in heavy metal toxic substances, and few lives can be digested and endured. This is indeed as the white night said, it is already a plane of dying, and there is no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the white night’s answer is: “To consume.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Consumption?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, consuming the other's strongman and even all the resources that can constitute force. This is the purpose of the extant battlefield. Noland and Daksodars carried out In the wars of the last millennium, the coordinates of the azimuth are well understood. But the direct plane is transmitted to another main plane, which is tantamount to suicide. Therefore, the absolute battlefield is the most suitable means of consuming the war potential of the other side. The birth of every sanctuary and even the legendary power means a lot of space resources. On the battlefield, the competition between the two main planes is the ability to let the other party lose blood. Once one party can't support this. Consumption, losing all the footholds on the battlefield, it becomes very dangerous. Because the absolute battlefield itself will become the best bridgehead for the attack, we can send the army to the direction. Go face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night faintly read Li Take a look and say: "So, in the absolute battlefield, the first thing is to live, the second and third things still have to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She led Richard to turn a corner, then pointed to the front, said: "Go and see the true face of the dusk land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察顺Walking in the direction she pointed, bypassing a large stone pillar, set foot on a platform, and suddenly opened up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard’s eyes, there is a grand world where there is no margin at all. The rugged earth has been extending far into the distance until it merges with the sky at the end of the sky. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth consists of black and dark gray, with a patch of dark and mottled areas dotted on the ground, like a piece of unhealed wound. The cognac huge riverbed is like a wound that has been cut open in the earth. I don’t know where to start, and I don’t know why it ends. I can’t imagine it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only visual inspection, the vast river that is dry is at least tens of kilometers wide, and the most open place may be hundreds of kilometers. If it is not the earth in the field of vision, Richard must suspect that this is not a river, but a strait! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is gloomy, the dense clouds cover the entire sky, and so many places on the lower end of the clouds are thick black. But in the clouds, there are still a few huge cracks. From the perspective of Richard, you can only see the thick clouds in the cracks. You can’t see what the sky above is. Only a ray of blood blew down the gap, applying a thick crimson strip to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a handful of places where the light of the sky shines, and the dark clouds block the sky, so in many places in the earth, it is black as night. But there is no absolute blackness. You can see a strip of aurora-like light shining in the blink of an eye. It looks very magnificent. However, when I saw the aurora band far away, Richard’s heart could not help but rush into the deep chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light bands are the same as the light bands in the depths of the turbulent land, when the time and space chaos ruptures, the scattered energy condenses. The light belt looks like a thin piece, and in fact it may contain a brand new huge plane. In the time zone of light, it is completely another time and space. Once it is swept, it does not know where it will flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
