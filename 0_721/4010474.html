After rolling for a few times, it did not move. The foremost general in the front rushed through three fire walls and finally fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart is set, standing against the wall, watching an undead creature rushing through the wall of fire, then falling down, whenever a wall of fire is extinguished, Richard will make up one more, although his magic is slowly falling, but at least until the majority of the undead creatures are killed, Richard’s magic will not dry up. These walls look much weaker than ordinary fire walls, but The duration is as long as a few minutes, and the power is actually surprisingly large. If you look closely, you can see that there are constant milky white spots in the flames. These are additional life energy. Once they are exposed to undead, they will Like pouring ice water into the oil pan, it will immediately explode, and the undead creature will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some energy added to these fire walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this moment, Richard immediately realized the power of a little rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that those who touch the rules can no longer be measured by the ordinary power system. In this case, Richard is not anxious, where? When the fire wall is extinguished, it will be supplemented by two more. The undead creature that died soon will be built around a crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly took out the elf long knife, flashed a shiny green awn on the blade, and then stabbed the wall behind him, until there was no handle, and the castle There was an earth-shattering madness inside, and the earth and the wall suddenly shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s foothold as the center, everything in a few meters is stained with green, and then hundreds of shoots are drawn from the soil. Open leaves, and finally the blossoming flowers of various colors, the elves secret sword, the faithful prayer, the third string of the moon of the azure moon, can be filled with life around the swordsman, and for the sword Providing life energy and repairing damage, this sword is not only a cure, it is also a deadly poison to undead and dark creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee was light and leaping, and had crossed the wall. Under him, the wall of the castle collapsed, and a huge skeleton creature collapsed. The wall of the city rushed from the castle to the outside of the castle. It has three side-by-side skulls. The forelimbs are all huge blades. However, there is a tiny wound on the skull in the middle. It is the wall of the sword that is being used by Richard. However, I have worn a skull in it. In this huge beast, there are countless small flowers that are constantly open. Those small flowers are thankful and then turned into nothingness, but there will be new ones in the blink of an eye. The buds emerge from the white bones and bloom again. When the flowers bloom, the white bones under the flowers will obviously sag down a large piece, and the beast will give a wailing of shaking the earth. After struggling for a few times, it will not move. And the power of faithful prayer is still there, the small flowers are still in full bloom, withering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard floated in the air and said to the castle: "Okay, take out your cards. I am not interested in playing with you anymore. You should know now, take this half filled with undead." Face to face me, it is completely wrong idea, if you still want to play, I will play with you to the end, I will kill everything here, light up, but it is necessary to see what you store in the black valley How much power can support the entire half-face without falling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dead silence in the castle, only the black fog is surging, and the undead army outside the city suddenly stops. After the steps, they turned and returned to their graves, one by one and returned to the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really don't know to give up, well, I will play with you to the end." Richard's voice turned cold, and he slowly raised his hands. This time at the fingertips, it is the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of fireballs are constantly being shot, distributed over the castle ten meters, forming a strange magical array, which is the upper limit that Richard can calculate and control. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky above the castle, a huge cloud of fire suddenly appeared, and then the flames were like rain, and a ** poured down from the air, washed like water The castle, this scene is too shocking, just like the end of the world, the fire finally sheds, the roof of the castle has melted like wax, and the distortion is not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first sneered, then shook his head again, sneer because it was as he expected, everything in this half-plane, castles, trees, undead and even It is the land, which is part of a huge enchantment. Any attack by Richard can end up being a painful temple, that is, the entire black valley. As for shaking his head, it is Richard’s discovery that such a huge magical array is still slightly exceeded. His ability, so that there is a deviation, causing the fire to be washed down, rather than a one-time burst, so it looks like a mighty power, but the power is not as good as a wave of explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee popped up dozens of fireballs again, and laid a slightly smaller magical array. This time, a huge fireball appeared in the castle, followed by a huge fireball. The mushroom cloud rises and the castle is neatly cut one meter after the smoke disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry and continues to shoot fireballs. In a moment, a mushroom cloud is lifted off, and a mushroom cloud in front of the sky has not dispersed. At this moment, the top floor of the castle has completely disappeared, and I don’t know how many undead creatures will disappear silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fireball floated again from the fingertips of Richard, Lee finally sounded a hoarse voice behind him: "Stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fireballs on the ball all popped out, and when I saw another mushroom cloud rising, I turned back and said, "Now I don’t think it’s late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Li After observing the body, a bald man stood naked, dark skin, strong and beautiful muscles, which made him look attractive, and this man’s face surprised Richard, this is a familiar face, that is, Li Check out Essien who wants to find this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Essien, Richard shook his head and said, "I thought you should be one of the many prisoners. I didn't expect you to mix well. This can independently master a half-plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essin looks very complicated, staring at Richard, and said for a long time: "How long does it take? You are already a great magister, you really are the invaders from the ectopic face, but unfortunately those people have blinded their eyes and let you grow to this point."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s backhand wave, in the roar of Essien, another mushroom cloud took off, the dark castle has been completely cut in half, after finishing these, Richard is only faint Say: "Don't tell me that it's useless, see it, this is the consequence. If you do this a few times, your host may not let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You,." Essien was so angry that he couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was able to ruin your temple, now I can burn your black valley, even the inner security can't help me, you think your master Can you do something out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the owner, Essien suddenly smiles secretly and says, "Why can’t you be inside, my master may not necessarily You can't take it. If you know what my master is, you won't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Essien and suddenly sighed. Said: "So, you know what your master is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien said, "Of course."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a heavy sigh and said: "You have made me very disappointed. For whatever reason, cooperation with the gods is unforgivable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien suddenly shocked and lost his voice: "You...you know that my master is a god, how can you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneered: "It is more evil than the painful hell. There are other things besides the gods who preside over this land. This is hard to guess. Besides, I have never seen a god."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentences are of course slightly bragging. Richard has only seen the Son of God, and the knowledge about the gods is derived from the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien is still unbelievable: "How can you know so many gods, this is impossible..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said: "You have been living in a closed plane, of course you will not know anything. The gods here block your eyes, block your ears, and even Playing with your wisdom, in my place, there is a complete tutorial on how to become a god. There are several places on the mainland to learn. There is no secret in the gods. People’s eyes are not limited to My own plane, I came to Hale Valley this time, I saw your name, I am ready to come and take you away, let you see the world outside Faro, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why take me away, I can't find any value that you can make such a big deal." Essien asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of your diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diary, but many of the things written there are Unfounded fantasy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is a fantasy, it is indeed a genius fantasy, and I see from you that you have a soul that is not blind." This is where your value lies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien said: "Ultra is a fantasy, maybe in your eyes I am a pioneer who transcends the times, but maybe only Because I am crazy enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugged and said, "What about that? For me, there will be no loss, I I feel that you are very valuable, but it will not hinder what I am doing because of you, for example..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, Richard backhand Waving, a mist of water appeared above the castle out of thin air, and then Richard opened the book of the bearing, one, two, three adjusted thundercloud storms covered in the castle, the electric light is dense The forest, the black clouds and the black castle are connected together. The thunder and lightning are dispersed into a myriad of dense electric spiders in the water vapor. They crawl around, every corner is not missed, there are many dark colors, or transparent. The monsters that are not shaped will be called, no matter where they are hiding, they will be hit by the ubiquitous electric fire. For these monsters whose shape is not fixed, lightning or life energy will cause great damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
