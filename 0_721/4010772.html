Any guy's cheap, so, I want to make a deal, don't know if I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the conditions are right, why not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stood and said, "You have heard of the construction of Midron, as if you have something to do with this."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Midalen in the Armed Forces of the Heavens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, do you want a design for it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s sentence almost made Richard jump, but Richard immediately calmed down, and since the other party took Midrande’s design as a bargaining chip, the content of the transaction must be different. At least, Richard doesn't think he will take advantage of Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More specific."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's face became serious and said: "My hand There are fragments of the king of angels, Midalun, and some of the manuscripts of the design drawings. If these are handed over to you, can you make a full version of Midrand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "It depends on how many fragments and manuscripts are there, and what step is your request, whether it is required to fully conform to the original design of Midnal, or to modify the design according to the actual situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many copies of the script you can make Midnal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinking, with a faint pride said: "If you have a complete manuscript, I can make a complete Midarun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin has eaten now Shocked, staring at Richard for a long time, said: "Do you know, just by your words, I have the urge to kill you on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"I know I also know that you certainly can not kill me. "Richard replied lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's answer is actually to say that he is no worse than the original St. Peter in the art of making the decoration. Every builder has a strong personal style, and wants to completely copy another person's work without Adding changes, it must have skills higher than that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin suddenly became agitated, pacing back and forth in the room, and walked for dozens of laps, Richard leaning against the back of the sofa, not urging Just wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin suddenly stopped and stared at Richard, slowly extending his right hand and said, "Do you want to be friends or enemies with me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the hand that stretched over and waved it gently and said, "Simple cooperation, your enemy is too strong, I don't want to find myself." Trouble, my own troubles are already enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s hand is still in the air, and there is no intention to take it back, saying: “We are both Together, the trouble will only become less, and I have an intuition that our ultimate goal will be to achieve the same goal. Alliance is good for each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s like not seeing Martin’s stubborn hand in the air, saying the same thing: “Still cooperate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie smiled and didn’t have any The expression of Yue said, "Okay, but as long as you like, my hand will always be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about the conditions of cooperation." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stretched out three fingers and said, "I want three sets of Midnal, finished, and I don't have the material, you will get the design draft of Midranden and There are 87% of the fragments, 60% of the manuscripts, and 60% of the pieces. I believe that you can do it because the skills you have made are already above St. Peter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard said faintly: "The conditions don't seem to be very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "Of course, there are two additional conditions, the one I gave you. Is the Holy Scripture still there, can you show it to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Okay, wait."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard has taken the book of creation and bearing, handed it to St. Martin, and when he saw this thick and important book, Martin’s face changed slightly, saying: "You have collected so many fragments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a few pages," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin opened the book of creation and bearing and flipped a few pages, then closed it again, stroked the cover, his face changed indefinitely, and after a while he said, "I can give you This."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Martin stretched out his left hand and a burst of milky white light appeared in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly gaze, because it is not an ordinary light, but a pure divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light, you can see the armored warriors in the ball of light, but these warriors don’t have helmets, but the high crowns that they wear in the gods. Such a special image suddenly reminded Richard of a special and powerful unit, the bloody arbitrator of the Bright Church Trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already recognized it, yes, this is the bloody arbitration of the church. Just load it on the book of creation and bearing, you can keep Summon Scarlet Arbitration fights for you, level between 18 and 20."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Martin smiled meaningfully and said, "You It should be known that their meaning is not limited to these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is really shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood color arbitration is indeed powerful, and the auxiliary magic they possess can not only greatly enhance the strength of the warrior, but also is a very good melee unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wear heavy armor, wielding chain shackles and other heavy weapons to fight, but if they think they can’t fight, they will be caught off guard, and the bloody arbitration has only one far attack. Means, the sacred fire, but this light based on light and holy power is extremely powerful, equivalent to the bombardment of eight levels of magic, under the same level, rare arms that can compete with the blood color arbitration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bright Church’s bloody arbitrator is less than one hundred, but it is one of the church’s most powerful deterrents. Thousands of soldiers have improved their entire ranks. In the past wars of the church, when there was a large-scale bloody arbitration, it was a rare defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the reason for Richard’s heartbeat. What he really cares about is that the power of blood-colored arbitration lies in the power of the god of light. With this unit, it is equal to It is also possible to get a lot of rules related to the light of God's power, which is the most attractive place for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at Martin's eyes and wanted to see through his thoughts that even a few centimeters of his mouth had a standard smile. Do you know if you have the ability to resolve the rules of the gods of light? If you know, this is a good intention. Still a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to capture his most subtle expression changes, Richard even used insights, but still found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said abruptly: "The acquisition of any power is not without any price. To get this level of power, do you not risk a risk?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not moved: "I have a lot of ways to get strength, so there is no need to take the unknown risk, to be honest, to this extent." Strength is nothing to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really bad, well, let me say my second condition, you will get me Friendship, the friendship of the future Pope, I will help you once and for all, within the limits of what I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I trust you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin pointed to his own heart and smiled calmly and said: "There is no other way, you can only choose the letter or not believe me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed and said, "Okay, I believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's hand flips, will The divine power ball presses into the book of creation and bearing, and then returns it to Richard, saying: "You can summon a bloody arbitration every day, one or two times each time. If you want more, you need this one. The book replenished energy and advanced again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened the book of creation and bearing, and the page was a bloody arbitration image, so he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and said: "The fragments and design drawings will be sent tomorrow, but when can you give me three sets of Midalun, of course, the more The better, the sooner the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two months, Noland time." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s eyes lit up and flashed a looming murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard immediately felt instigated and walked one step at a time, just entering Martin's dead end, letting his thriving momentum suddenly stagnate, this step seems simple, but it reflects the superb combat skills, Li When he told Martin, his every move was seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin sighed and said, "This time, this time really makes me want to kill you, why should you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to kill me, why do you want me to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order not to let I have done my own stupid things. I have enough enemies. I can’t add another opponent of your level. If someone wants to kill you, let them come, it won’t be me anyway.” Martin is quick and fast. After saying this, it was as easy as putting down a heavy burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while he was walking: "No wonder you only sold two holy costumes at the press conference, but did not accept orders. I thought you were because There is a dragon's back hand, as for other sects, it is limited to certain materials and cannot be mass-produced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frowning: "How do you know that I am not limited by certain materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and shook his head and said, "You didn't even ask me about Midalun. What materials are needed, or if you are technically culminating, you can bypass some key materials, or you have a lot of rare materials in your hands, and you are not afraid of shortages. Now, at least the former is certain. And the latter is also very likely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so sure of the latter." Richard seems to be ready to pursue the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the technology and speed of your make-up, from the time you made your first life, plus you are in the secondary plane The time has passed so many years, I believe that you have accumulated a huge amount of materials, even if there is a shortage of materials, you can use the structure to change back, maybe other builders will have a shortage of materials, but you, me I believe it will not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and said, "Now I want to kill you too."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin smiled and said: "Since we all have the heart to kill each other, it is more necessary to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
