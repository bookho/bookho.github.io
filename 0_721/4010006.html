			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be! My teacher broke through a bottleneck and made A unique new work. But equipment and activation require a lot of magic crystals, and the structure can only be used twice." Richard said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger on Amman’s face was flat, but it was still difficult to control his emotions. He repeatedly said: “Unimaginable, hard to imagine!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to enable the Sanctuary to improve the overall level, I am afraid that it is possible to get close to the level of artifacts. Teacher Richard’s new ‘construction’, even if it can only be used twice, is enough to be listed on the same level as the quasi-artifact. At a critical time, this build means two extra lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with this news, Richard is explaining in a string of terms that are difficult to understand accurately, and how much material is needed to install and activate the structure. Put it on Amman's heart. Precious magical materials are worthwhile for a quasi-artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary is also very different, and the two are the same as the 16th level, because of equipment, combat skills, vindictive characteristics, experience Differences in talent and other factors lead to great differences in combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cossacks of the Red Cossacks are only 16th, but they started from the civilian warriors, all the way in the endless killings and wars. However, it is recognized that the combat power is tyrannical, which is comparable to the ordinary seventeen-level powerhouse. When Luofu meets them, he naturally wins less and loses more. However, if the strength of Luofu can improve the whole level, the hope of winning can be increased to 70% or 80%, which is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing can be rushed forward with 70% confidence, and those who can become sanctuary will not lack this courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this matter is even more simple for Luofu than to defeat two opponents. He is equal to experiencing a higher level of power in advance, to him. It is very beneficial to re-enter the first step in the future. After entering the sanctuary, it is extremely difficult to upgrade one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Amman immediately made up his mind: "Okay! If your makeup really has this effect, then I can promise you now, treating the red Cossack." In fact, Luofu adults will become your staunch ally!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of this matter are so great, there is no need to inform Luofu in advance. Amman and the holy swordsman are very familiar, knowing that Luofu has no hesitation. And Amman does not doubt the ability of Teacher Richard. He has always been concerned about the information related to Richard. Although everything is in a hidden state, since he has long known that there is a magical item of "construction", then naturally It is known from some information that Richard has a "construction" deal in the Duke of the Sequoia kingdom. Since this magical item begins to appear in batches, it means that its manufacturing process and effects are beginning to stabilize, and more powerful upgrades will be developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, this is the list of materials needed for the device and activation. Oh, sorry, for the sake of confidentiality, this list adds some material, value It is almost equal to the cost of constructing the basic parts." Richard said, while handing over a list to Amman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman has no objection to this statement. When other magicians process special magic items, the materials requested are slightly more than they actually need. Prevent technology leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to get them in a week, the processing time will take about ten days. Then Luofu adults should still need a few days to adapt to it, so our time is very urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the long content on the list, Amman, who was mentally prepared, still couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, saying: “The above things are worth at least 200,000 gold coins!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opportunity for 200,000 gold coins to buy two strong opponents is not expensive. Gold coins can always be earned, but powerful forces do not have the opportunity to get them." Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded heavily. Richard is right. He wants to buy a chance to defeat the Sanctuary opponent with 200,000 gold coins. It is almost impossible, let alone twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman looked at the list again and said: "Time is a bit tight, but within five days, all the materials above will be handed to you. But can the processing time be shortened? The strong Cossacks are likely to arrive at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and said: "Processing process It will be done by me. Ten days is already the limit. It is impossible to be short. It takes a full two months to know that my teacher has completed the basics. And if you want to finish it within ten days, the quality of the materials cannot be any. The problem, and the better the quality, the sooner the completion time will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Old man Amman frowned, hesitated, said: "So My suggestion is that it is best to discuss it with Tiffman. The conflict between Jinhui Battle Flag and Red Cossack is increasing. Any proposal to make Red Cossack unlucky is always very interesting. But I really want to convince the fat man. Is not an easy task. If Jinhui Battle Flag Ken Station On our side, things are much easier. They also have two Sanctuary strongmen, and the Falcao adults will soon be able to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I thought about it and said, "Good! I am going to talk to Tiffman. I think he will stand on our side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Richard saw this big fat man in Tiffman's magnificently decorated living room. He had just slept shortly, so of course, Richard, who had disturbed his dreams, didn’t have any good looks. He just thought of the dual identity of the great magician and the constructor’s disciple, and he barely climbed out from the warm and comfortable bed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman moved himself into the large sofa and yawned and said, "Dear Richard, you have to bring me some Good news to make up for the precious sleep I lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, me, Amman, how do we divide the interests of the red Cossacks?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard was not big, but Tiffman’s eyes suddenly widened, and the huge body bounced directly from the sofa. He pointed to Richard and said incoherently: "You, you are crazy, this is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other people say this, mention Fuman had already thrown him out of the living room. But Richard is an extremely young great magician, and any sentence spoken by the great magician needs to be taken seriously. Every great magician is a person who combines talent, strength and wisdom. The judgments they make rarely have the time to make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to pay a lot of money, just let Falcon adults sit in the blue water oasis for a few days, and then support me a group of fighters, or you can Become a slave to the warrior and you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
