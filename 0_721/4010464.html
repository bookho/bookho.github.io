			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a lonely boat in the sea of ​​anger, throwing a flight in the storm Although it was extremely thrilling, it was never sunk. In this battle, Richard was particularly hard to fight. Although he finally got to the next city, he was already feeling faint. The sand was like a bubble, and it could be easily pressed into the water, but Pressing is too heavy, as long as she looses her hand, she will rise to the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this is another war that is doomed to fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between the sand and the sand, Richard’s past basically ended in failure, this time it seems to be a big win, but at the last minute, victory But it has cast a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rested for a while, this time with a stretch of sand and a stretch of arms, wrapped around Richard’s neck...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, the war is still going on. This is the contest between the gods and the fighting, the war between the gods and the magic, and the confrontation between physical strength and will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is caught in a deep dream, the rest of the person has long gone to sleep, but the person who is fighting is still suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard’s angry roar, fell with the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is over, the first thing to sit up is the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal and the dragon of the time has a perfect body, the skin soaked with sweat is like a moist nephrite, the luster is as soft as the smoke Ascend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand stretched out and made a big yawn. He only felt refreshed and his eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky, but in contrast, Richard sighed in his bed and gasped, just wanting to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand flowing out of the small hand, on the ass of Richard’s ass, said disdainfully: "The region’s bear chief, the warlord, also wants to be with the eternal and the dragon of time. The oracles contested, oh, huh, haha, hahahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun re-lighted the bloody land, Richard finally climbed down from the bed. The whole body is sore and painful, as if the hands and feet are not their own. He has no strength to cast an ice water technique now, just rushing to the bathroom and rushing his head into the cold water. Slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft voice came from the window, and Richard’s heart moved, standing to the window and looking out, but seeing the sand flowing in the courtyard, telling more than a dozen boys and girls about the teachings of the eternal and time dragon, standing next to a handsome The young man, who is faintly revealing the brilliance of divine power, is already a 14-level grand priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Xisuo, the first friend of Richard’s native Faro, the son of Baron Fontaine. In a twinkling of an eye, this boy has grown into a youth. And there is such a remarkable accomplishment in the magic, time really has a dream power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys and girls in the courtyard also have more or less traces of divine power, and the sand in the courtyard is full of youthful beauty, like a flower Filled with flowers of the sun and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long day and a night, the news that Richard summoned followers has spread to all directions, that is, those who have not established a soul link with Richard, can also pass through The parent nest unit gets the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning is the time when Richard is scheduled to review the Faro plane, but except for Gangde, only Clark has rushed back in time, in the conference room, just De, Shuihua, Liusha, Qiqi and Clark are the core layers of the Richards Corps staying in the blue water oasis. With the progress of the conference, the current development of the Principality has gradually launched a magnificent blueprint in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Faro, Richard’s Crimson Principality is now a behemoth, although it is still nominally attached to the Sequoia Kingdom, but many nobles are privately crowned. It is the title of the deep red country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "nationality" comes from the old saying, although it is not the current general term for dividing the national strength, but it is generally used to call the vast land of respect and fear, such as God country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Crimson at this time is no less than an empire in terms of armaments, and now the population of the entire Crimson Principality has exceeded 5 million, and more than A slave of the population, and a standing army of more than 100,000 people, and a slave army of 50,000 people. The soldiers inside can be converted into civilian status as long as they serve for three years and have certain military achievements. And this change is completely unrestricted. In addition, there are more than 150,000 reserve fighters who have been trained and can play when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By benefit from the huge wealth generated by the face trade, and the rolling gold coins obtained from the trade channel of the monopoly, the wealth of Crimson in recent years is completely blown out. Accumulation, even as time goes by, this kind of profit will slowly fall back to the normal line, but it is enough to support the deep development of the deep red in the same period. With the support of huge military expenses, Crimson can build a far beyond the normal population. The proportion of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the average equipment level of the Crimson Standing Army has been equal to the several ace of the Iron Triangle Empire. The equipment of the slave army is also equivalent to the regular army of the Iron Triangle Empire. This means that in just a few years, the wealth accumulation of the Crimson Principality will be Catch up with the savings of the Iron Triangle Empire for nearly a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the core of the deep red is the army of all kinds of mother nests, the backbone of which is the tens of thousands of knights, this time the nest is no longer With special concealment adjustments, thousands of Centaur knights were created directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centaur Knight does not need to consider the problem of cooperation with the warhorse, so the same level of combat power is still above the humanoid knight, the resources consumed are slightly lower The current mother's nest can produce twelve centaur riders in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centaur is a race that Faro already has, but the indigenous Centaur has a low level of civilization, does not master refining techniques, and only fights by physical superiority. The centaur produced by the nest are armed to the teeth. This is not an exaggeration. The half-humans created by these nests have orc-like huge fangs. It is definitely not light at the crucial moment. This is the native half-human. There are no weapons at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, perhaps the mother's nest holds the habit of Richard, perhaps it is its own instinct to fight, it has created as many as a thousand Reconnaissance bats, under the leadership of more than a dozen brains, are spread across the borders of the Grand Duchy. They will also go deep into the various human kingdoms to observe, which is equivalent to hundreds of eyes every moment. Staring at the border, any other country has any dispatch and will be discovered immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the mother’s nest also has an air force consisting of thirteenth-level lightning wind snakes. These wind snakes have as many as three hundred heads, and they can shoot the equivalent of six. The level of magical lightning, only three shots a day, does not seem to make much use, but this is specifically used to deal with the enemy sanctuary or the big magician's troops, the power of their collection of fire, that is, the town's strong and never Dare to block. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is a re-edited 14th-level elite Knights of the Sui Feng, this unit is two hundred rides, has been stuck in a turbulent place, did not participate After the battle, this is a special force specially reserved for Richard. Except for Richard, even a conductor like Raymond cannot fully exert their combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is still stuck in the ninth order, it has completed all kinds of preparations to the tenth order, and now the lack is still divine, the nest The current storage of divinity is as many as six hundred points, but the construction of the avatar requires five hundred points of divinity, so the remaining divinity is not enough for the hen's nest to advance to the tenth order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the large amount of resources required for the Jin Dynasty is also extremely amazing. It is basically equivalent to about 10 million gold coins, and the weight has reached nearly 20,000 tons. It is a star-shaped raft, and it needs to be transported dozens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, when Richard was promoted to the Great Magister, the followers did not stop moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunde is a sanctuary, Clark is a 16th-level sect, and Sandro has been promoted to the Great Magister a year ago, Tiramisu It is a further step forward, and now it is already a horrible 19th-level ogres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the last step, only the twilight and the Oral are left. The elf poet and the twilight are both seventeen, the difference is Ola. It is limited by talent. His potential for measurability is only a sanctuary. Due to the dual profession, he has never found a suitable way, so he has not been able to break through the final barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the twilight is the help of the mother's nest to suppress his own strength, still tempering the skills and soul, the mother's nest analyzes a lot of sanctuary The powerful skills of the person can be transplanted directly to the twilight by re-modulating the modulation, but that will only be required if the parent nest is tenth-order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Three Goddess has been thriving, and its speed of expansion is very surprising even from the history of the Faro gods. The fire of the gods and the powerful gods of the weak gods will only have this kind of grand occasion during the peak period of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddesses are now weak fascination. The pioneering goddess of spring water is even more shocking to the middle of the gods. Their devotees have more than 100,000 people. The shallow believers and the community of secular interests are ten times more and are still evolving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now every day, there are a large number of wandering people pouring into the deep red duchy, trying to find a better life here, and the massive wealth not only supports the deep red Principality The establishment of a large and elite army is also supporting all aspects of urban construction, national political construction, and people's livelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy that Richard has attracted a large number of people to settle down has never changed. These people are not only the people and the soldiers, but also the source of faith, from the faith. In terms of the collection of power, the total number of beliefs provided by the believers may not be comparable to the large number of believers. Their greater significance lies in the stability of the power of faith, as well as the continuous generation of clergy, and the believers are actually in control. In the hands of Richard, they are just ordinary people who seek to live. Faith is no more important than the bread and bacon that can save a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
