			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sequoia Kingdom, the Earl of the Field already belongs to the Grand Noble sequence, to launch a The domestic war is enough to attract the attention of the elders and the aristocratic class. Most importantly, this war currently seems to have no interest. Richard himself is poor and white, without any accumulation of wealth, the territory is ridiculous, even if he wants to occupy, he has to pass the seal of his seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a country, internal friction is inevitable, and in a sense, it is also a process of internal self-adjustment and survival of the fittest. But the internal friction without any meaning is not allowed by any savvy superior. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has a strong lord, the opponent must take into account the Duke’s reaction from the beginning, and must not do some behind-the-scenes transactions. This is politics. But now the Duke of the Wolf has personally gone to the Principality of White Rock. This war will last for at least a month or two. The Duke of the Wolf will not return to the territory, and the Duke of Glasgow will be in the same line. It is difficult for people to discuss the matter with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Duke of the Wolf, mobilizing the army, arranging the marching route, resting the supplies along the way, and even seconding the priest to the temple, are trivial and necessary preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most lacking time for Richard is time. As long as he gives him enough time, his strength will continue to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest will continue to create combat units, and the fourth-level arms throwing soldiers are already equivalent to the combat power of the elite knights. And Richard himself will continue to convert the magic material into a structure, the construction part will become the strength of himself and the followers, and the other part will become the material cost digits or even ten times the gold coins, and then the gold coins will become Magic material, so repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than half a month after the time has passed, the huge ransom of the Viscount of Heim has only a few thousand gold coins left, and the new army of Richard has been initially trained. Now, they will take them to the battlefield to kill the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, when another elite throwing soldier took a dozen ordinary throwing soldiers to Richard’s camp, Richard felt that the time was ripe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Richard summoned the core followers and told them to prepare, and two days later they would go to the land of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Head, how many people are going out this time, who is guarding the territory?" Gangde asked. Since Richard asked him to take charge of the training of the troops, the big man began to study hard and learn about the fighting. Of course, the foundation of Gangde is a little bit worse. In addition to pulling the two sealed knights to supplement military common sense, he also needs to learn literacy. The primary language magic only includes listening and speaking, but not reading and writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all set off with me, and a soldier on the territory did not stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision was made to surprise everyone. The castle was still building a castle, leveling the road, and recruiting the people to open up wasteland. Everything has just begun, and Baron Xiaofang Dan is still watching behind. Do not leave people to guard the territory, is it not to be led by the people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expressions of everyone, Richard knew what they were worried about. So I smiled and clicked on the map, looking around at the crowd, and asked: "You said, what is worth guarding on this territory now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The castle has already laid the foundation, there are roads, and there are also reserved timber..." Speaking of this, Gangde’s eyebrows have been raised and some have been understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "Yes, these are the things. When they come, they can only see these. These are not worth the money, they can’t move, and more. What's important is that this is my legal territory. If someone else comes over and has to pay it, I will give it back to me later. Unless I don't exist, there is no use here. This is the most fundamental order of the aristocratic system. Destroy. So, in my territory, the most precious wealth is actually the army, and you! I just take all the troops out, and the Viscount and his father’s uncle should be overwhelmed. Isn't it to come to occupy my territory? When they come, they will find nothing here. If they leave, they will naturally be fine. If you don't leave, how many troops will you stay in my territory? There are many people left. The cost is not a small amount, there are few people left, I can come back at any time, eat them all at once!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So!" Richard tapped the map , stressed: "I want to come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the third day, Richard led the troops from the territory, entered the blood-stained land, and disappeared into the red world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, a thousand-scale army entered the baron of Xiao Fangdan. This is a mixed force consisting of heavy infantry, longbowmen, and squadrons dedicated to cavalry assaults, all composed of elite veterans. These forces are from the Earl of the Deer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the army is Sir Hogan, commonly known as Old Hogan. Old Hogan is already fifty years old. He has been in the military for more than 30 years. He has been careful and steady, and his life has rarely been defeated. He was originally a civilian, started from a soldier, and got the Jazz title all the way. Although the old jazz could not touch the threshold of the upper class, at this critical moment, the Count of Crows always remembered him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is a very hard bone, a truly intelligent aristocrat wants to add brilliance to his home, only to find those who are raging No one will be willing to take a look at Richard, except for those who are extremely arrogant or have a tendency to abuse themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new arrival of the baron led by the Baron, there are two great magicians and two ten-level priests, and six junior priests. The follow-up forces of the Count of Canglu are gathering, which is a larger force, including two hundred elite heavy cavalry, six hundred light cavalry and two hundred Knights of the Temple. The temple of Xerxes sent a battle god officer led by a 12-level priest, and the other two great magicians were also in the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the follow-up regiment is the brother of Count Cang Lu, the uncle of the Viscount of Hem, the Sir of the Holy Land, Sir Odom. Odom was violent and cruel, and he did not want to act. He had raped a noble lady with royal blood in the early years and was reduced from a baron to a jazz. But because of his identity as a sanctuary, the disposal will stop here. As for the noble lady, she was treated as a shame by the family and sent to the country to marry a remote jazz wife. However, Odom chased it again, and then the jazz had an accident, and the lady became his lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these 'small' shackles, Odom’s personal strength is tyrannical and he is also very talented in the lead, so in the eyes of the upper class, he still Can be reused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
