			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel raised doubts at the time, because the eternal and timeless dragons did not need faith However, Richard, who has a mother's nest, will never lack a soldier. Pushing the baggage inspection policy will only waste time, and it seems that the effect is not so obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the barbarians refused to yield and sell to other human kingdoms, there are countless ways for slave traders to give them a chance to give them the problem. Professional people, this is wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Richard smiled and said: "I just want them to live better, and we also have this ability, and it won't cost too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant muttered to continue to express opposition. In his view, the plane war is the process of chasing resources and interests. In the past, there were many Nolan big aristocrats. The ruling area promoted the Huairou policy, but most of them failed, so there was such a sentence: "Noland's orcs are more beautiful than the aliens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on hate is not resolvable, abstractly speaking, it is a conflict of different rules system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not refute the words of Iraq and Russia, but directly announced that the war in the ancestral highlands was implemented according to this plan. After making a decision, Richard said: I came here for the sake of my interests and strength, but I might as well pursue some ideals in the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contradictions, and meaningless." Io said, In the eyes of true clergy, the world can always be divided into two camps, and other things can be handled as such. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Richard smiled and admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, when Richard returned to Faro, the policies of the year were widely disseminated, and the repercussions in the races such as orcs and barbarians It is not as intense as the human countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro is the dominant position of the Terran. The war strategy of the Terran to the Alien is to extinction, to steal everything that can be removed, to kill all resistance. The guys, and will become a slave to live, resell to distant countries, so Richard's behavior, for the entire Terran, is a different kind, and it is difficult to be accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren't for the title of the goddess of the three goddesses and the spear of the gods, perhaps someone would doubt that he was the devil who came from a different face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effects of these policies have gradually emerged, and Richard’s growing alien army is one of them. The calm situation in the occupied territories is another One effect, along the way, Richard’s troops have barely encountered the barbarians’ harassment. Of course, under normal circumstances, the human countries will be equally calm after attacking the alien land, because they have killed all possible resistance. Alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancestral highland of the sky, Richard’s Doomsday World Tree flag steadily advances, and one side of the flag gathers in this battle flag. Around, every face of the battle, is a team of battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of bats and flying eagle flying in the air, monitoring all the movements within a hundred kilometers, and there are more than a dozen brains in action with them. Under the coordination, the army of nearly 100,000 people is neat and uniform, neat and tidy like a machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his followers stood on the back of the star and looked down at the army slowly advancing below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally smiled and said: "With such an army, I can easily defeat the enemy's millions of troops, and the four true gods can gather together. The army, but that's all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The money you spend on this army is no less than the enemy's million-strong army. What a strange thing." Flowing sand has habitually poured cold water on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "If it is my own command, I don't need so many people, these troops are left for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war with the four true gods may not be as easy as you think, be careful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, this steel torrent has stepped through the small semi-ancestral source The Highlands, at the distance of 30 kilometers from the Great God of War, was the first to encounter the army of the highland God of War. It was an army of nearly 10,000 people. The equipment and weapons were disorderly and the number of races was numerous. It was a complete mob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the team, there is also a tall mobile tower with four savage upper body barbarian beatting the drums. A whole body of colorful sacrifices is desperately dancing and dancing, praying for victory, indeed there is a touch of light. The light of spurt falls on the believers, but it is too insignificant compared to the crimson army that is armed to the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of all the forces that have an absolute advantage in all aspects of the investigation, they actually took the lead in launching attacks, madly charging, completely unable to talk about formation and cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel torrent of Richard was only slightly blocked, and it was crushed from the mad believers and continued to open to the Great Shrine of the Highland God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Richard and quicksand stepped into the Great Shrine of the God of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great temple was not built for a long time. Due to the lack of materials in the ancestral highlands, it was magnificent and luxurious, and it was 50 meters high. In the Great Shrine, the high-altitude God of War stands up to 30 meters. From the appearance of the statue, the Highland God of War seems to be a barbarian warrior. He wears a horned helmet and has four arms, each holding a sword, an axe, a hammer, and a shield. Three of them are weapons that the barbarian warriors love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the god is on the light red light from time to time, which means that the will of the high god of war is still in the image of the god, but at this time all his high-level magicians are Grabbed it up and handed it over to Clark and Nai'er for disposal. The two of them naturally had the means to temporarily isolate the clergy and the shrine's passage, so even if the Highland God of War wanted to communicate with Richard, they could not find the clergyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard’s doing this is tantamount to cutting off the communication channel with the God of War, because Richard feels that there is nothing to talk about, he launched this battle of God. The purpose is not even conquest, just to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that a few hundred years ago, the Highland God of War is not like this, he looks more like a hybrid of humans and dwarves, holding a sword in his hand. With the shield, and only two arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is also looking at the statue, saying: "This is normal, many gods in this plane, especially the weak power The guys, in order to get more faith, will change their image to be close to the race intended to develop believers, which will make it easier for the believers to identify and develop their beliefs faster."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in this way, their image of the gods is not fixed by the believers," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, so those who are weak in the plane, many are guys who have no exercises, such as your three goddesses." Speaking of here, sand drifting The tone is somewhat different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately opened the topic, which is not a question that can be explored in depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddesses seduce Richard with various clergy more than once, and more and more young and beautiful girls in the priesthood of Lanshui Oasis City, even There are also teenagers, who also hint at Richard through the priests. When necessary, their goddess and even the avatars may have a wonderful night with Richard. If the sand will be happy, it will be a hell. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands are not pursued again. The three goddesses are the biggest disguise of Richard in Faro, and they have been tied to the chariot of Richard. How can she be unhappy? It will not push such allies out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation of the Highland God of War is actually not as good as the three goddesses. Originally his best way out was to vote for Richard like the three goddesses, but hesitated and missed. Timing, now want to go to Richard, but it is late, Richard has decided to take him as an example, to the Faro local god to see the enemy's end, have a draw, some blow, this is the most Effective practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will first look at what else is in this temple." After that, Richard looked up and scanned the entire temple, in his eyes, The tangible material structure of the shrine is becoming transparent layer by layer, and no secret can be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly snorted softly, staring at the eyebrows of the gods, where there was a thick shadow that could not be scattered, actually blocking the insight. power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee released a floating technique, soaring to the head of the statue, carefully looking there, the shadow is less than half a meter in the head It didn't look too big, so he pulled out the short knife and dug it into the statue. At the tip of the Kung Fu knife, there was a soft sound from Ding, and it touched something hard. Richard picked it with a short knife and a fist size. The metal ball was dug out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This metal ball is dark black, polished to be extremely smooth, it is extremely heavy, a small thing, the weight actually exceeds a ton, if not Richard I was alert in my heart, and I found that it was wrong. I immediately sent a few magics and almost dropped this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
