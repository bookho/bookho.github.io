			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a holy spirit, according to the divine system, even a half god Not on, can actually predict their arrival thousands of years later. Doesn't this mean that Zuka's divine power is still above the dragon of eternal and time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "The Holy Beast? What is the Holy Beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The troll sacrifice pointed to the unicorn in the courtyard and said, "Isn't that the holy beast? It is very sensitive to the people infected by the evil spirits. I also saw it in the battle just now, with evil spirits. When the tribe touches its unicorn, it will burn and die in pain. But the atmosphere of evil spirits is thus purified, and the souls of these tribes are finally released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard looked at the unicorn, and then looked at the troll sacrifice, always unable to expel the strange feeling of the bottom of my heart. The unicorn is a special unit created by the hen's nest with divine and Him's blood. It has only just gotten it, and it has become a holy beast in prophecy. It is unbelievable. Although in many planes, the unicorn is rare and powerful, it can be regarded as the name of the sacred beast, but the unicorn is not a natural sacred beast, but a counterfeit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, now you can tell me about evil spirits and holy devices?" Richard said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice is a surprising match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the evil spirit, even he does not know, only know that after the sacred sleep, the evil spirits occupy the original temple and the altar of Zuka . As long as you are close to the temple at the top of Zhubwal, you will be affected by evil spirits. Many trolls will enter the temple and never come out again. The will is more powerful, and the troll warriors who have not entered the temple will be affected. It is very likely that they will lose their wisdom and become instinctual beasts. Around Jubwal, there are seven or eight troll tribes living. All tribes that can survive have a new sanctuary shelter. The troll ritual and the two nearby tribes all believed in Qom, that is, Richard saw the statue of the rhinoceros. Only the tribal warriors with the Holy Spirit can enter Jubwal and retrieve the water needed for survival from the upper city. But when they go more and more, they will gradually become trolls who lose their wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dry season, the only source of water that the troll tribes can find is in the upper town of Zhubwal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the troll sacrifice also told Richard how to deal with evil spirits. The storage tank of one of the trolls' three saints is stored in the depths of the royal cemetery in Jubwal. As long as you get the storage tank, enter the temple, and sacrifice the ancestor in front of the altar, you can summon the evil spirits. At this time, you need to sacrifice at least one sacrifice to seal the evil spirits in the storage tank. If Richardson goes to deal with evil spirits, the troll sacrifice is willing to sacrifice himself and use his own soul to stimulate the storage tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening, Richard made people take the troll sacrifice out, then looked at the sand and Iowa and said, "What do you think?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ioah shrugged and said, "If you have any idea, just say it! Mr. Great Sorcerer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He is not angry, he sinks a bit and says: "If the tank can really seal the evil spirits, then it is likely to be a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian interface: "Maybe? It is simply! According to the breath I felt in Zhubulvali, once this evil spirit is sealed, it can fully meet the standard of medium sacrifice."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha also nodded to recognize the views of Iraq and Russia, adding: "In Noland, intermediate sacrifices often cause war between two great aristocrats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As soon as he thought of the unprecedented list of gods, Richard could not help but be tempted by this possible intermediate sacrifice. But he forced himself to think about the risks and then said: "According to the sacrifices, this evil spirit has a strong spiritual control. To resist this attack, there seems to be nothing too good except for the strong will."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Yibo’s hands to spread out and smiled brightly: “I am not a problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : "I have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is speechless, it seems that the only problem that may be problematic is himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Richard reached an agreement with the troll sacrifice, and Richard will deal with the evil spirits, and the troll sacrifice will fully cooperate with Richard, and Will sacrifice their own to seal evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Richard returned to Zhubwal, this time he had more than a dozen trolls in his team. In addition to the troll sacrifices, there are several Berserkers and ten infected trolls who have lost their wisdom. The trolls who have gained wisdom by evil spirits are the key to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the troll sacrifice, Richard quickly crossed the Emirates and came to the bottom of the temple. There is a passage leading to the bottom, which is blocked by two stone doors at the end. Behind the stone gate is the royal cemetery of the troll capital. The storage tank of one of the three saints is in the depths of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal cemetery is extremely magnificent, and the two stone gates are as high as ten meters, and there is no way to see how thick. The stone door is engraved with a lifelike feather snake totem. Standing in front of the stone gate, Richard actually felt that the two huge stone carving feather snakes were looking down on themselves. From the two stone gates, Richard perceives that there is a huge force flowing slowly. He pushed the stone door hard, but the stone door did not move. The two stone gates themselves are extremely incomparable, that is, the ogre can not push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice went to the stone gate and said in a hoarse voice: "Let me come, there are only special ways to open the door here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice shows that the two mad warriors pulled a troll who lost wisdom. The sacrifice took out a boned dagger and slammed into the heart of the troll! Originally a gray-white bone dagger pierced the troll heart, a bloodshot quickly appeared, and then quickly spread to the entire dagger. And this dagger actually swells and shrinks, if there is life, is desperately sucking the blood in the troll heart! The troll, which is extremely powerful, was swallowed by the bones, but it became apparently dried up. It turned into a mummy-like corpse. The bones in the hands of the sacrifices have turned into deep purple, and they have been squashed in a circle, like a grasshopper that has been full of blood. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the sacrificial plaque inserted the bones into a small hole in the stone door, the surface of the stone door began to spread blood, and the blood in the bones was continuously injected. Shimen. The entire cemetery shook a little, and the stones and ash were constantly falling from above. The two heavy stone gates open themselves and slowly slide into the walls on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice is over and explains: "Only the blood of the traitor and the fallen can open the gate of the cemetery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and walked into the cemetery, and immediately frowned. Behind the stone gate is a large and far-reaching hall. A row of slabs are placed along the walls of the hall. Each slab is housed with a troll's mummies. Below the slate, there is a gray-black pottery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the sacrifice rang again: "These are the soldiers who guard the cemetery. They are the spiritual pots under their feet, and their souls are placed inside them. They are the most loyal guards, guarding this place for generations."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead atmosphere in the cemetery is extremely rich. In this environment, almost any body will be transformed into an undead. But the trolls' corpses are intact, and there is no sign of turning into undead. It seems that the secret is in those jars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cemetery’s undead atmosphere is too rich, and even the humanoid warriors can’t afford it. Even in the case of quicksand and Iraq, there are not many people who can protect in this environment. In the end, Richard left all the soldiers outside and only followed the followers into the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery is divided into three floors, and the scale is magnificent. It is just over three thousand troll mummies. In order to get the storage tank, the troll sacrifice once entered the royal cemetery, but in the rich undead atmosphere, he only had to retreat when he entered the second layer. If you go deep into the third layer, then the troll sacrifice will be directly transformed into undead by the undead. After thousands of years of accumulation, the soul of the dead in the tomb of the king has been so thick. Fortunately, this time there was a sand and Iowa, and this team of more than a dozen people was able to enter the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But upon entering the third floor, Richard saw at first glance that the pots under the feet of the trolls were all smashed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice screams: "Be careful! These royal guards are resurrected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the lobby In the middle, each of the mummies seemed to feel something, and they stood up and swayed, slowly rushing to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not panic, but first put a few detectives on these mummies that turned into undead. The radiance of the detection shows that the strength of these undead is mostly between 13 and 14. It seems that the strength of the tomb guard is indeed higher than the elite troll mad warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Richard, a team with a luxury priesthood, the undead is a very popular enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand first opened the book of time, after a spell, a dazzling ball of light floated from the book of time, floating on top of her head. The ball of light continually radiates the light golden light, illuminating the range of twenty meters around. As long as the undead enters the range of light, it will be like being ignited, and the body will burn a faint sacred flame, burning them with painful screams. Part of the weak undead, Emperor Zhang, escaped from the range of light, and the mighty undead warrior rushed to see Richard and others. But within the scope of the sacred flame, the undead has been greatly weakened. Their current strength is even less than ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha waved the fate of the twins, and a fire wall with a powerful addition appeared in the hall, keeping the undead out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the fire wall is very insidious, just on the edge of the sacred radiance of the sand, and the dying guards rush into the wall of fire, and they will be hit by the sacred and the flame. The fire wall will burn for thirty seconds and is long enough. Even if the Undead Guards pass through the wall of fire, there will be only half life left. However, Richard is still not satisfied, but takes out the book of the bearer and releases the six-level natural call stored inside. So the six violent bears lined up in a neat row, almost appearing against the fire wall. The Guardian of the Undead has just rushed out of the fire wall with a fire, and will be taken back by the violent bear, and then can only stand in the fire and fight the violent bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: A new week, what about the PS? Nothing has been added yet! Do you want to add more today? The reason is that you are in a good mood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
