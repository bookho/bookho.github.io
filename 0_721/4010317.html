What is Bright and Bright."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in front of everyone, Richard began to add magic to himself, and even gave a few precious magic scrolls that he carried with him. Used up, for a moment, the nobles were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has protested, including Cardiff himself, the magician and the warrior duel were allowed to be blessed first, as long as Richard does not use magic to beat people, Adding more physics-enhanced spells to yourself is not a violation of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard stepped forward and suddenly burst into a dense electric fire, while his right hand took a piece of afterimage and smoked on Cardiff’s right face. Then, at the speed that the nobles did not respond at all, the backhand was drawn on Cardiff’s left face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s face bursts with a strong temperament, rushing to Richard’s right hand, only to see the intensity of vindictiveness, knowing Richard’s The right hand is fierce, but the hands of Richard are also blooming with the light of electric fire, no matter what it is, it is not magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's movements were so fast that it was so fast that Gardiff could only rely on the instinctive position. The two vindictive violent clashes in Cardiff's face, violently erupted, and the flesh on his face could withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif screamed, his face was flesh and blood, and even a spurt of teeth, the whole person was pulled out by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dead in the auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that Richard’s body as a magician could actually fly out of the Sanctuary’s Count of Cardiff, which is incredible, although Dark Blue Master Known for being physically strong, it is impossible to achieve such a degree, and no one can blame Richard because he does not use aggressive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s two slaps, the strength of the power, have reached the level of the 16th and 7th-level fighters, and Cardiff is a sanctuary, relying on the face. How can it be blocked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha never looked at Cardiff again, but he took out a million bills from the pocket that he had promised to pay, and gave it to Lina. : "Your."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina was shocked, holding a huge sum that had never passed, and was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked closer to Lina and whispered, "This is the pocket money you deserve, and the equipment you are selling."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s body gently shocked and received the bill silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats onlookers were amazed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are surprised that Richard’s understatement has pulled out another million, instead of whether Lina should get one million if she is in another family. With the powerful power of one enemy and two on the battlefield, I have to get a million or so in a year, but Lina is in Archimonde. It is not bad to earn tens of thousands a year. Her equipment is almost all. It is by confiscated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most embarrassing and hateful place of Gordon’s year, with the thirteenth knight’s terrorist power, at least tens of millions of consumption in other families. However, their treatment in Akmenderry is simply a white job, and they still seem to be happy. It is not that no family wants to use the price to dig corners, but they have nothing to gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this one-in-one, the income gap between Archimonde and other families has been closer, not to mention the one of the thirteen knights who has an extremely powerful horror, Modred, who does not know. What is the origin of this demon king, he appears as if he is in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Gotton disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gotton is gone, but there is another Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Gordon are completely opposite styles. Gordon is famous for being poor, but he can gather a group of powerful knights to discuss, and Richard is beginning to reflect Out of his strong ability to make money, his followers, regardless of quantity or quality, can't compare with the 13th Cavaliers, but seeing his recent major moves, he knows, publicly recruits knights, and purchases a lot of ultra-luxury weapons and equipment. And the unprecedented number of step knights, and so on, one day, Richard will completely overwhelm his opponent with the construction of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So father and son, let the current nobles do not know who they are more willing to face, the only place where people can be happy, thank you for the sacrifice of Mensa, Let people face Richard and Gordon at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction is over, but what happened at the auction is destined to be talked about for a long time. What is certain is that there may be many people who think that Kemond is a nouveau riche, but the main vein of Archimonde under the control of Richard will never be degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the auction, Richard purchased a total of eight epic gears, all of which have clear attribute points and are ready to be distributed to followers. Millions of magical materials are enough for him to use for a while, while the magic light chain is prepared for the ultra-precision forces in the future team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, when Richard said goodbye to Nyris, he went to the Eternal Dragon Hall to take the order of the soul contract reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this time he returned to Noland, mainly to give the two secrets of life to the royal family, and exchanged for the top sacrifice, a life 诛The price of the royal family is 13 million, and there are also a hundred magic horses that cost 12 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips is full of praise for the quality of the magic ride. When the big mouth opens, it is necessary to order another five hundred rides, which shocks Richard. If the promise is down, then the mother nest will not have to do anything else in half a year. In the end, Richard only promised to deliver it in batches within one year, and then no more supplies. The emperor snorted and smiled and accepted the result, but In order to confirm the order, he paid a deposit of six million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Richard came out of the palace, he had a full 34 million royal redemption bills in his pocket. If he talked about his personal financial resources, Count Cardiff would definitely be the number one person in the young generation of Faust, and thought that It was because of the shortness of the director, but he did not expect to hit the steel plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the Eternal Dragon Hall, it was already in a mess, and the priests and shrine warriors were mobilized and counted to receive all sorts of messy donations. Although Cardiff and Richard pointed out at the time of the auction, they still revealed the bottom of the layman, and most of them were of little use to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard came in, Nolan’s great priest stopped him and smiled and asked, “Are you crazy, how do you donate so many things next time? It is worth millions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combating the needs of the enemy." Richard laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But most of these things are useless to the Eternal Dragon Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try useful stay Under, useless to sell, not on the line." Richard looked innocent expression, "Gold coins will always be useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ..." Nolan really didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the apse of the Eternal Dragon Hall, the flowing sand is locking two amber eyebrows, thinking about a box of magic in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ** of the bear’s first overseer, which was sent by Richard after the filming. The use of this thing is naturally known, even if it was not Clearly, I will know when I use the book of Time. What she thinks is, why does Richard spend such a big price to buy such a thing, and the majority of the priests in the Eternal Dragon Hall are women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let her think about it and I don’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stayed in Noland for two days, and knocked on Richard in the heart of his own enemy, and squatted late at night, carrying all The followers returned to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to Faro, it is the stars that hang high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an independent small building in Oasis City, Richard saw Zonghu. His injuries are still heavy, and he can hardly use much power. At any time, Iowa and Naiyou always follow one another. he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard saw Zonghu, this dark-haired young man was sitting at the window, staring blankly at the sky outside, wondering what he was thinking, I didn't even look back at the people who walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went straight to Zonghu’s side and placed the set soul contract reel in front of Zonghu. Zonghu didn’t look at it and grabbed it directly. Let it tear, let the magic of the scroll immerse into the body and mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his eyebrows and asked: "You are not afraid of what I am doing inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Zonghu said: "I was deceived more than once, how can I do it again and again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Zonghu only looked up When I looked at Richard, I suddenly showed a smile, and suddenly there was a soft wind blowing through the room: "If you are such a boring person, you have already been killed, and which one has been living for so long."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also true." Richard smiled and placed a thick book in front of Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this." Zong Hu saw the book at first sight, and the eyelids were a hop. The title of the book turned out to be "The Throne of the Gods." Next, the payment is Theodore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A textbook on how to become a god and how to pull God from the throne," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is really such a textbook, this..." How does Zonghu go against the deviant? After all, it is still a Faro soul, deeply branded the plane rule, the law Some of the conventional views are still deeply ingrained in his ideas. For example, even if he is a god, he believes that the gods are almost unmovable, so he will be so shocked when he sees this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of place is Noland? There are actually textbooks that teach people how to become gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the book, only to see the preface, was deeply attracted, and his eyes could no longer be separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
