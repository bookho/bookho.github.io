			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called merger, but not just the form, but also the requirements of blood, specific It is the younger generation of the ancestors who have been out of the forest in the Yongye tribe. They must marry the Yi language tribe, and the next generation is the Yi language tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of merger, Licha knows that it is for the blood of the Yongye tribe, and the Yongye tribe can successively appear the son of the forest and the daughter of the forest, indicating that Special blood talent, they are not long enough, the tree of life is in the early stage of maturity, so the overall strength of the tribe is not strong enough, but from another perspective, the overall strength of the Yongye tribe has approached the full life tree. The Yi language tribes explain their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This generation of proverbial tribes broke out, and there were two sons of the forest at one time, and it coincided with the mysterious injury of the great elders of the Yongye tribe. The tribes gathered together the other three tribes to jointly attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard this and asked casually, since Melin is the daughter of the forest, is the slang tribe an extra requirement for her? Thinking that Melin’s little face immediately became iron and blue, she would not speak anymore, but she did not notice that Richard had inadvertently broken the identity of her daughter in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the way, Richard and Melin met two more hunts, and Richard quickly fled with Merlin on the hidden path that was temporarily discovered. In the end, I went to the Aoba tribe in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristics of the Aoba tribal territory are obvious. The trees here are extraordinarily tall and green, and there are actually the rays of the sun shining from the canopy, letting the eyes look Can not help but shine, as soon as stepping into the territory of the Aoba tribe, Richard immediately felt some kind of natural power, this kind of power is more lively and more lively than other places in the forest, so vivid power characteristics, think of the Aoba tribe The way to get out of the border of your own territory, people familiar with the Aoba tribe, such as Melin, will stop when they feel this power, waiting for the people of the Aoba tribe to appear, and feel unconsciously going to the depths of the territory. Most of them are enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few minutes, the footsteps of the rustling sounded in the woods, several tall elf hunters appeared in the canopy, and then an imposing young hunter from Jumping out of the tree and staring at Richard, he said to Melin: "The daughter of the noble forest, the elders have been waiting for you, but what is this outsider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lin replied: "I encountered wind, rain and water sounds in the road, so I was late for a few days. Without the help of Richard, I might not be able to."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young hunter’s face eased a little, saying: “The daughter of the noble forest, the elder is already waiting for you, let you see him as soon as he arrives. As for the outsider, I have to go to the territory with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard going to the territory, the young hunter did not say it, but Richard is very clear, the leaves In the depths, the arrows also pointed at themselves in a motionless manner. Naturally, he was afraid that he would run, instead of intending to give him any rewards. Mei Lin was slow and saw some wrong tastes. He said to young hunters: Richard is not an ordinary outsider, he is recognized by the forest will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hunters suddenly shocked, all eyes are gathered on Richard. What it means to be recognized by the will of the forest means that you have acquired the basics of being a child of the forest or a woman of the forest. Grid, this qualification does not say no ,, almost in one thousand, the whole tribe Aoba such a person is not more than five, in front of which several young hunter not one of them naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is the daughter of the forest, and the words that are spoken are naturally authoritative, but Richard is still an outsider, how to see how it makes people awkward, several The hunter opened the real eye and looked at Richard. Under this circumstance, he was shocked by the truth. The natural atmosphere of Richard’s body was almost dripping, and the inner part of it was the noble atmosphere of the tree of life. Apparently recognized and disregarded by the forest will, the degree of pure richness is more than that of Merlin, which is at least one level higher than the existing forest son of the Aoba tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s natural flavor can make people smell the tree of life, which is already a level that elf hunters can’t understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is not surprising. The so-called son of the forest is just a talented person who can sense the existence of the forest will and can borrow the power of the tree of life to some extent. Higher can borrow the power of the world tree, and advanced can borrow the power of the entire forest will, but borrowing is only instinct, does not mean understanding, and does not mean mastering this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard is really real and through the rules of the plane to grasp and mobilize the surrounding nature and life forces, if regardless of the total amount of power, only look at the level of power In the words, he is only half-small than the forest will, and when Richard has mastered all the 65,536 rules, he is even higher than a world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard can resolve all the underlying rules of the plane, he is even higher than the forest will, which can be called the father of the forest will. As for the sons of the forest, the daughter of the forest, it will be worse than two generations. This still refers to the level of the first son of the forest, such as Melin and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle truth of this is that Richard himself does not know very well that the young hunters are even more confused, and their apparently become more cautious, Mei Lin thought that it was his own advice. However, Richard is now old-fashioned, but in the eyes of the elf hunter, he sees something other than hatred. It is not a respect, but a complaint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is also a guardian elf tribe and a tree of life, so I want to understand between the thoughts, he has the blessing of forest power, which is in the eyes of the guardian spirit It is the ultimate in wealth and glory. The problem is that Richard is a human being and an outsider. In the traditional concept of elves, he is not qualified to own this wealth, but now Richard is there, which will undoubtedly make all the guardian spirits I feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have the strength of forests will feel that they are not so scarce, so it is not so important. If there is no forest power, it will be more unbalanced. Because they are self-proclaimed to be the people of the forest, the things they dreamed of were taken away by an outsider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care, but followed the elf hunters to the tree of life of the Aoba tribe. During the journey, Richard did not forget to appreciate Scenery: In fact, he is observing the power system of the Qingye tribe territory and the power characteristics of the tree of life. On the way, Richard suddenly saw an unremarkable vine of an old tree, and suddenly he was shocked if he did not remember If it is wrong, this kind of thing called thorn leaf vine is a very rare alchemical raw material. After its branches are ground, the fiber inside is the best raw material for the high-end magic scroll. The sale has always been weighted by grams. I didn’t expect to see a strain here. The thorn leaf vine is extremely picky about the growing environment. Its supply has always been in the hands of several magical families and giants. It is good to see that this thorn leaf vine grows well. The environment of the tribal territory is very suitable for the growth of this small thing. If it can be planted on a large scale, it means that a new source of money is found in the green forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard observed the thorn vine, there was a sudden wind in the back, an elf hunter was obviously intolerant, with a long bow bow On Richard, he said, "Make something, go quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longbow was firmly drawn on Richard, but he couldn’t get it back. The bow of the longbow was already in the hands of Richard. The elf hunter even took a few times, but he couldn’t get back. He said, “You What do you want to do,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly asked: "What do you want to do, want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are several elf hunters around who immediately bend their arrows and aim at the arrow. The arrowheads are all directed at Richard. The head of the elf captain shouted: "External, let's not let go, let's put the arrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled lightly, a touch of green oozing from the palm of his hand, and instantly spread to the entire longbow, the fine longbow was actually sprouting in front of everyone, even opened Two small white flowers, the use of this natural force is pure, that is, the Great Druids in the Presbyterian Church do not have such a level, but this time, this long bow is ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longevity of the guardian elves is complicated, and it takes at least ten years from the selection of materials to the production. The more boutique, the more time it takes, The longbow of the Aoba tribe is a boutique that takes 30 years to produce. The entire tribe has made dozens of longbows a year. Now it is destroyed by Licha, almost almost the same as a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hand, and all the Elf hunters are frightened. After all, Druid’s natural spells are more powerful than the hunter’s archery. Much more, the ability to communicate with the tree of life is the sole of Druid, so the status of Druid in the guardian elf is much higher than that of the elf hunter. This position can be laid by relying on strength, facing an obvious big Druid, the number of elf hunters is seven or eight times that of Richard, but still dare not have the idea of ​​winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around for a week and said, "This offense is just a little disciplinary, but the next time it’s not as simple as ruining the bow, I will Killing, whoever dares to put an arrow, I will kill anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf hunter captain was shocked and angry, and said: "You dare."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try the string."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meilin hurriedly blocked between the two sides, angered: "Li It’s my friend, is your Aoba tribe treating my friend like this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter captain’s face changed a few times and waved the hunters’ bows After snoring, I said to Mei Lin, "The daughter of the noble forest, this time you should ask for it, we will endure it once, but the tolerance of the Aoba tribe is limited."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
