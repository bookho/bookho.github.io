			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two small things, especially seeing Irene and other men intimate The situation actually still had an impact on Richard, but he did not know it at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the entire bay was still asleep. As the winter progresses, the night is approaching, and the time of the sun is early, but this does not affect the brightness of the outdoor. The ground, the hills, the vegetation, the river, the ice are everywhere, everything is frozen and solid, refraction The blue and white spectrum are the main light. Only the sea in the harbor is still undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unintentional Richard stood in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window of more than ten meters high, silently overlooking the magnificentness of the ice floes. After he spit out a smoldering turbid gas, he suddenly felt that his eyes were wide open, his heart was stretched, and he could almost accommodate the entire ice floe bay. In the face of grand space, the darkness of the past few seasons has only left a faint trace. Although it may accompany Richard for a long time, or even think of it for the rest of his life, it will be a bit stinging, but every memory, every pain, is wealth after going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to open his eyes and observe the world around him. The first thing that enters the line of sight is the people in the dark blue. The most contacted are the mentors who teach themselves, but in the eyes of Richard, they are no longer the alchemy machines that only constantly shed their knowledge, but become living humans, elves, dwarves, and even Black elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magisters also have their own emotions and sorrows, as well as their own interests. They see that each person’s eyes are different and their attitude towards others is different. . With one hand and one shot, one eye-catching, even the same words, different tones and different tones, all reflect different conclusions in Richard's real world. As the understanding of the Magisters is increasing, and the observations are becoming more and more careful, the number of samples available for comparison in memory is increasing. Richard suddenly finds that the teachers have said a lot of words and made many expressions. What is hidden. And these hidden things are gradually being opened by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentors are divided into different areas and the relationship is different. Some areas are very similar, while others are irrelevant. The relationship between the Magisters in similar fields is often not so good, and there will even be naked and mutual trampling, such as 维奇维奇 and Riley. The relationship between the magicians in irrelevant fields is much more harmonious, and many are good friends. After observing these, Richard contemplates meditation and realizes that the key words that connect these phenomena together are competition, and behind the competition is the interest represented by gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening his eyes, Richard also knows a lot about it. For example, now he finally knows why he suddenly added so many geography, mathematics, painting, and magical genius courses, and he also heard about his future identity as a sacred architect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that the teacher is going to train himself in the direction of the builder..." Richard muttered silently. Although he was a teenager who grew up in the mountains, but in the dark blue for more than a year, Richard’s vision was no longer the boy who didn’t understand anything that day. However, although the position of the builder is superb, it is as light as water in the mind of Richard. Under the subtle influence of Elani for ten years, Richard did not know that he had a big heart that was insulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in any case, knowing the teacher’s expectations of himself, Richard will not let her down. The children in the mountains are stubborn and they are also very clear-cut. Richard is very clever, and many sufferings and twists make him far more mature than his peers. Now he knows his special position in the dark blue, and he knows how many people will be crazy about the joy of his teacher. And many people with ulterior motives, although they look at the eyes of Richard, who are full of shackles, sins, and plunders, but still keep a certain distance with him, and even dare not use the conspiracy on his head. Pana was just an accident. It was a few aristocratic children who didn't know the depths of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Richard has found that no matter where he goes, there will always be one or two people who are following themselves. Whether it is Richard's own feelings, or the thorny light in the crowd from the good intentions to the fear of retreat, he can know that this is not surveillance, but protection. In this way, whenever I think of the teacher's greatly embarrassing character and the characteristics of love for money, there will always be a faint warmth in the heart of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only warmth that Richard has received this winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, in the days of sorrow, Richard’s studies were not affected at all, but instead triumphed in the magical world. Only by thinking of it, he will be somewhat gratified at the beginning of his mature heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is like winter, and then, unconsciously, spring has arrived. After the completion of the day's school, Richard dragged his tired body back to the residential area. When he passed the lonely steel figure standing in the corner, he remembered that his birthday had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the head intact, the steel dolls have been severely distorted and almost invisible. That is the result of Richard's repeated use of the bloody ability of the outbreak. On the wall near it, there are also large and small pits, which are traces of being hit by steel dolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over to the figure and reached out and gently stroked the mottled dent on it. There are sharp folds in the dents, as well as sharp cracks in the cracks. And the dents are not only his fists, but also elbows, shoulders, knees, and even heads. More than one dent was condensed with old blood stains that had been some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the tingling sensation from the fingertips, watching the blood marks, Richard realized that I thought that in the busy winter and the past winter, In fact, it is not quiet at all. Those pains have been there, but they are so deep that they have been almost forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel doll's head is intact, and the smooth and round surface reflects the somewhat deformed face of Richard. The dolls have been ruined, and the connection of many materials is only a thin line. Perhaps it will be detached from the main body after a single hit. Richard smiled and reached for the face of the doll, and strode to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day's course has a drawing class. After listening to the whole theory of art appreciation, more than a dozen students politely handed in the homework drafts and then left. Richard was the last one to come up. I don't know why, when I saw a young boy, the master suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and his eyes subconsciously avoided the eyes of Richard. As long as I think of the ‘painting’ that Richard has handed over, the master feels like a wet, cold creature sticking to his body, and he can’t get rid of it. How sad it is to be sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master’s gaze passed over the work that Richard had to pay and found that it was just a small painting of 30 cm square, which was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a landscape painting that depicts the ice floes in the winter, showing the cold, chill and magnificence in the usual brushstrokes of Richard. Compared with the darkness and frenzy of previous works, this painting has rarely returned to normal, although the power contained in the lines still makes the master feel the faint cold. When he was relieved, the master suddenly discovered that Richard was watching his eyes intently, and the pupils of the sapphire blue were invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this picture look more comfortable?" Richard's softly whispered words instantly gave the master a cold sweat! He instinctively jumped out of the seat and almost stumbled over the robes of his robes. But he couldn't care for the wolverine, and pointed his finger at Richard, saying, "You.......you......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Richard is calm and has an iceberg, and the smile on his face is more elegant and beautiful, and it seems to be the temptation of the devil whispering. But the devil whisper is tempting, but the master knows the painful price behind the temptation. It will be the soul that will fall into the abyss! Looking at Richard's rare smile, the cold sweat that slides down the master's spine is more, and what makes him feel chilling is that if he remembers it correctly, Richard is just twelve years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master would like to ask how Richard knows his feelings, but he has no choice but to export. No matter how Richard knows it, now I know it. And after a little calm down, the master knows that Richard must have something to say. This 12-year-old child gave him a feeling of being completely unpredictable. And those paintings are always reminding the master, how crazy it is in the depths of this boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master took a deep breath, sorted out the clothes, took out the proper appearance of the instructor, sat down, and indicated that Richard could also sit down. Richard did not sit, but like any ordinary apprentice who consulted the course, he first bowed to the master with respect and respect, and then asked with well-trained etiquette and elegance: "Master, first of all, I want to invite you. Tell me about the world of the builders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master glanced and shook his head and said, "I am not a builder, but just a twelve. If you are talking about the knowledge of the builder, you should ask the Phil Magister, or the Hulu Magister, who is teaching you the magical makeup. I don't know how much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He interrupted the master and said, "No, I don't want to ask the expertise of the magic pattern, and I want to know what the outside world is, what a builder has to do, what responsibilities, how they all live. Also, what are the existing famous builders, their life experiences before and after their fame, Deeds, etc., I want to know this. Phil or Hulu is mostly in the deepest time. In the middle, unlike you who have traveled on the mainland, and were once VIPs of the three imperial royal families, you must know more about these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The question of Richard once again made the master stunned. He did not understand why Richard asked these things that were no different from anecdotes. However, the master immediately thought of a possibility and felt incredible. According to common sense, this is by no means a matter that a 12-year-old child should consider. But out of caution, he still asked one more question: "Why do you want to know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I want to be a builder, I need Knowing what the world of the architect is, how can you go further in the world of the builders. Knowing the life of the great builders in history and in reality, you can know what setbacks they have had. What are the experiences? At least, they have made mistakes, I don't want to make another second." Richard replied. After a pause, he added, "The world of the builders in the eyes of the builder is different from what others see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master is out again A cold sweat, this is exactly what he just thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it is impossible to push it, and from a single emotional point of view, he is willing to pass on his knowledge to the child in front of him. These days, through the silent communication of those pictures, the master looked at Richard and always felt different from other students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sorted out his thoughts and said slowly: "Okay! First of all, my opinion is that the builder is not only the creator of the miracle, but more They should be called the weavers of the nightmare. It is because of them that they have the appearance of the ultimate armed armor. One of the fortresses, the levels and the mountains that are regarded as never falling, are all in the iron hoof of the knight. The next smash. The emergence of the builder changed the war and changed the pattern of the mainland. It also allowed Noland to speed up the expansion of the ectopic plane. Without them, the world might look like another. There will be so many lives disappearing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
