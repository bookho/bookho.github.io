Turbidity smiled and said,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris took a deep breath, went back to the room, looked around, and found that there was nothing he wanted to keep, or wanted to carry it, he took out a piece of paper and laid it on the table. On the top, I wanted to write something, but I took the pen several times and put it down a few times. Finally, I suddenly smashed the paper into pieces and shattered it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patiently standing in the same place waiting, there is no urgency at all,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Nyris shredded the paper, he said: "His Nairsi, this It's useless. There are still some time and opportunities. You should do something meaningful and find someone who is useful. This may help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The useful person Nyris is a stiff, seems to remember But, violently shaking his head, and expelling the idea from his mind,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity coughed twice and decided to understand the words: "His Royal Highness, your side There should be some useful people, such as the lady of the Millennium Empire or the owner of a floating island in our alliance, which may make you stay tonight, whether it is successful or not, depends on their attitude towards you. I am willing to do it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris suddenly smiled, his pale cheeks suddenly a bit of color, slowly said: "You Is it Meks? If it is her, what is the difference with the present, as for others, there is no more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, that's a pity, Please go with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris no longer hesitates this time, nodded, followed by turbidity through the heavy courtyard, until the Queen Before the palace,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity pushed open the door of the temple, stopped and said to Nyris: "I am here, you Go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris walked in slowly, jingling, the door was closed behind him, and Neris was taken aback and looked back Looking at the closed temple door, suddenly biting his teeth and striding into the palace,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the big palace is hollow, you can't see a figure. Nyris turns a few laps inside. The more he walks, the more he is afraid. In a moment, it feels like he is left in the world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the unpredictable sound of the characteristic suddenly sounded next to it: "You are afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese slammed and turned to see Her Majesty sitting next to the window, her feet high on the window sill, holding a bottle of wine in her hand, and slamming a few mouthfuls from time to time, she was sitting there, but Niles was Not aware of her existence,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris stood up and said loudly, "How can I be afraid of you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an ironic smile in the corner of the mouth, asking: "You know why I am looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for me "The blood of the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you agree with Mex, if you promised, I might consider letting you go."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyre Sneeringly said: "It's all breeding, is there any difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undecided smile begins with a cruel taste: "There is a difference, I often put toys It’s bad, and Mex may have to use it for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Play casually.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Nothing smiles lightly, even some flattering look, said: "You are going to fight out, but now you can also tell you the real reason, what blood descendants are dogs / farts, I call you, It’s because of your mother.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My mother.” Nyris has a bad hunch,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, I had a big fight with Philip and Vatican. This battle has a big reason for your mother. At that time, I was still very young, and I was challenged by that. I ran to find Vullen's decisive battle, and it turned into a decisive battle with Philip. After that, I went to the Outland, but I didn't expect that when I came back, the smuggled goods became the Philip's emperor. There is also your hybrid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris suddenly angered and said: "You are a woman who doesn't know how many men have been."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, Neris’s face is stunned. There is a lot of slap in the face,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing still sitting still in place, Nyris does not know how the slap is drawn up,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris simply sneered, and did not wipe the blood from his mouth, just said: "I was cheated by my mother, I can only say that you are too stupid."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word was not finished, Nyris suddenly was undecided to hold his neck and put it in the air, and the unfinished eyes suddenly began to spray a purple fog fire, obviously It’s anger, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainly watching Nyris calm or even a sigh of relief, suddenly smirk, reach out and grab the front of Nyris, force A tear, the clothes broke open, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen looked coldly at the four emperors who were caught in her hands like a doll. "It seems that I have to Make you play bad Yes, I thought you were still smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s clothes all turned into slap-sized rags, and the pieces scattered and let him The body is finished/dew, but it is unexpected, but it is very unexpected, saying: "You actually"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris suddenly relaxed his body, Closed his eyes, just sneer, a portrait of what he wanted to do, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing suddenly smiled happily and said: "You thought it would be fine. No matter what you look like, I have a way to pack you up, come and fight for me, resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, not fixed in Nyres Whispering something in his ear, Nyris suddenly opened his eyes, screamed and exclaimed, and began to struggle and struggle, but no matter how to throw it, he threw Neris on the bed, then stepped on it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris struggles like a fish caught in the water<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, turbidity press & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp opened the door of the palace, <br <br /> & nbsp />;When the door opened, Nyris had already stood there. I had no idea how long it stood. His blond hair was scattered in front of his forehead, his eyes were red, his face had dry tears, and his attractive lips had no blood. The empty eyes seem to be a dead world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris wears a casual emperor’s casual clothes, compared with his original clothes. The style of the uniform is even more pulling Nyris in the neutral direction,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity seems to be taken aback, then put on a humble smile , slightly squatted, asked: "His Royal Highness, where are you going now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to my place." Nyris's voice is weak and empty,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." Turbidity said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three days, the undecided queen I am in the palace, I can’t close the door, no one can see it,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that Nyris suddenly recovered, what to do, even start to clean up Line up Hand, it is said that he is going to go to his own private plane to operate, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Nyris has found the representative of the Millennium Empire in Faust, crisp and neat The place refused the marriage contract with Mex, and gave no reason,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the Millennium Empire could hardly believe their ears, because it was not long ago. Nyris has already promised the marriage contract, and Mex has returned to the Millennium Empire to prepare for the wedding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big event, already well known. However, Nyris suddenly broke the contract, which was tantamount to a slap in the face of the Millennium Empire, and Nyris’s attitude was almost rude,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This will definitely have consequences, but Nyris does not intend to take care of what will happen next, and he will arrange his life by himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Queen did not show up until the twilight of the fourth day. When she pushed open the door of the dormitory, she saw that the turbidity was waiting there, in fact. The turbidity flow stood here for three days and three nights, never moved,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am hungry." No, "<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity immediately showed a bright smile and said: "The kitchen is always on standby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, I decided to sit down at the restaurant and the table in front of her Full of food, there are more big meals coming up like water,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No knife and fork flying, eating constantly, her belly is like A bottomless pit, no matter how much food was filled, it didn't respond until the thirty-fifth main course was over, and the Queen said that it could stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat for a moment Suddenly, one mouth spit out a purple flame, then said: "Eat enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picks up the napkin and rubs the deep purple lips Slowly said: "The turbidity, so far, all the games are not fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity is slightly surprised, asks: "It also includes Nepal. Rees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity frowns: "Should not Ah"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Nothing suddenly smiled and said: "You don't have to think again, I think, I have found the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that is Why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have a more fun game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need me to do What.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing shook his head and said: "Nothing is needed, you are optimistic about the palace, and I have to leave for a few days, what is the big deal, You know how to contact me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish." The turbidity answer is immutable,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing stands up, jumps out directly from the window, forcibly tears open space in the air, disappears into the gap of the space,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place where there is no way to disappear, not moving for a long time,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
