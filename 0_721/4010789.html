			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I can’t find a reasonable explanation for a long time, thinking about it suddenly Laughter, the secret channel has complicated things up. If you want to know the reason, you won’t know when you knock down the temple city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the sky is gradually brightening. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha led the army to camp, slowly approaching the Temple City,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Army On the scale, the pope on the head of the city was gloomy, and the cardinals around him were also angry. A cardinal anger said: "With such a person, dare to attack the temple."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said: "This is an opportunity. We attacked the whole army and burned all these heresy on the trial column."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Pope’s scepter waving, the long horn sounded through the sky, and more than half of the cardinals took off their robes and exposed the armor of the outfit. They were originally the fighting sects,<br />< Br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is full of smoke and dust, and the army is constantly mobilized. After a while, the gates are wide open, and the Knights of the Temple of the Knights are the first to rush out. Then there are the priests, the sects and even the many cardinals. The tens of thousands of troops immediately flowed from the city, and they formed a battle under the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde slammed his bald head and said incredibly: "This is going to be a battle with us outside the city. The heads of these god sticks are fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha replied: "You see their city defense, the city. There is no difference in fighting outside the city. If you look at the unit I brought, is the city wall useful? Instead, if the city is decisive, the battlefield will be broad and wide, and they will have enough space to assemble the troops. It seems that they are beaten, it is estimated that Think of us as the vanguard, and we plan to eat us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde nodded,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to the thousand human elite knights in the Principality, the female nest can easily Climbing up a 10-meter-high wall, and there are flying locusts and stars in the hands of Richard, the role of the wall is greatly weakened. After the break of the city, a small number of ultra-precision troops of Richard can concentrate on assault, but the opponent’s tens of thousands of troops There is no place to start. If a small-scale force confronts, it is a one-sided slaughter. The encounter of the Cold Iron Throne is a precedent,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the last sentence of Richard, Gangde’s face flashed a murderous voice and said: “His grandmother’s, so arrogant, I will rush to the first one, and first slap him a few birds and singers out.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha glanced at Gangde and said, "Put the helmet on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde immediately Put on a smile and say: "That is too heavy, and it blocks the line of sight. It is really in the way, you see"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't wear it, there is no suit effect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current defense is already as thick as the turtle shell, you see"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't wear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde helpless, had to mutter and take off the helmet from the magical buttocks, reluctantly buckled on the bald head, the helmet is worn The whole heavy armor immediately had a faint glow,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the sky, a few gray spots hit the sky, after a while Turned into a few thunderclouds, floating above the tower, just cut off The road to return to the city, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first piece of thundercloud is still outside the city gate,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cardinal on the city head sneered: "Look at what it is, the thunderstorm, still in that position, this is the intention to cut off our army's retreat or cheer for our triumph."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after a while, everyone on the tower has become very ugly, including the cardinal who is ridiculed,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thunderstorms are increasing in a piece by piece, but the power is not amazing. The number of lightnings shot down from Thundercloud is limited, and the speed is very slow. Three minutes or four lightnings are dropped in one minute, and it is necessary to cut off tens of thousands of troops. Of course it is impossible, but these thunderstorms are seven levels of magic, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite heremist can instantly send seven levels of magic, although amazing, but it is, the key is The distance between the tower and him is more than a kilometer, and the thunderstorm storm can be easily routed from the door defense area to the tower area. Is that his casting distance of more than kilometers, even the legendary mage, not everyone has so far casting range and such precise control, <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;As a result, the city tower is no longer a safe area, the cardinal and the pope are within the scope of Richard’s magic bombardment,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another cardinal Do not speak, raise the scepter, a white light from the head of the stick to a thundercloud just above the tower,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the white light just makes the thunder The cloud surged a bit more, and then became normal again, continuing to expand at a speed visible to the naked eye,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal changed his face and forced the scepter to force Several white light shot to Leiyun, this time finally succeeded in bombing a few big holes, and the cardinal has been tired and pale, the bottom of the power, but the hollow on the thundercloud began to recover immediately after the attack. Seeing that it will take a long time, Thundercloud can return to normal, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this horrible Thundercloud?! All the cardinals are involuntarily showing this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two cardinals also continuously fired several light of digestion Finally, the cloud of strange thunderstorms was wiped out, but other clouds of thunderstorms were constantly growing, and there was always a kind of repression that could not be said,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The three pale cardinal's pale face and weak breath show that their power has been consumed by half. This cloud of thunderstorms is surprisingly difficult to dispel, and it is harder to deal with the nine-level magic they have seen.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinai claims to be the god of time, although it seriously exaggerated his priesthood, but how much can affect a little time flow, his own power also includes basic time rules, but Richard’s origin Noland has sacrificed countless times, and each sacrifice is an opportunity to directly face the rules of the power of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To analyze the level of the rules of time, but the understanding of the rules of time is not known how many times stronger than the Sinai, the Thundercloud he shot has been slightly adjusted, so that the resistance to Sinai is greatly enhanced, < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing from His own Thundercloud was dissolved, and Richard did not care. He waved constantly, and there were seven or eight thunderclouds at the top of the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bishops suddenly looked like they were, and no one would use the light to dissolve them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope has been looking up at the thunderclouds of the sky. His face has become more and more gloomy with the growth of Thundercloud. When the Thundercloud was finally eliminated, the Pope whispered: "There is a rule power in Thundercloud." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the rules,,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few cardinals are shocked, most cardinals It’s a stunned look, their strength or level is not enough, and they don’t know what the power of the rules means,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clicking, Thundercloud finally fell first The lightning, just hitting a heavy armor, ignited a fierce fire, and a powerful impulse knocked down several soldiers around him,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Compared with tens of thousands of troops, the damage of several soldiers was completely insignificant, but the entire army officers were turning back and looking at the place where the lightning fell. Many soldiers had fears on their faces,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderclouds in the sky have gradually become one piece, reaching a few hundred meters, and are still expanding. Speeding up to the scale of the square, such a huge magic has exceeded the understanding of the vast majority of people, even if there is God's support behind them, even if there is the name of jihad, the hearts of ordinary soldiers have finally shaken, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger the thundercloud, the less lightning there is, but it’s the power that doesn’t happen, it’s desperate,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cardinal who mutters: "Where is the great Sinai's avatar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just said half of it, Blocked by the Pope's fierce eyes, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope stared at him and said slowly: "You are suitable to stand on the front line, go."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for the cardinal to spit out the next sentence, several special church knights wearing black armor swarmed up and set him down the city,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal screamed a few times, suddenly burst out and shouted: "How long do you think you can still be the pope, this time, Nai's avatar is still not moving, but also when, those thunderclouds can resist the power of Sinai, you have to watch how far it grows, you really do not intend to let the army outside the city come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal screamed loudly and screamed, and spread far away. The military squad in front of the city suddenly had a commotion, and more soldiers began to look up at the thundercloud above their heads, and their faces gradually showed fear, <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundercloud is still growing wildly, and the speed is getting faster and faster. The shadow cast onto the ground is like a puddle, which has completely covered the route of the army back to the city,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army suddenly moved forward slowly, not the general of the commander, nor the commander of the Knights of the Church, but the army saw that Leiyun had spread to the top of his head. Subconsciously squeezing forward, the result pushed the entire army, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, only a lightning bolt has fallen in the thundercloud, and the power is not particularly large. Then there is no movement, just growing, the speed is getting faster and faster, and the expansion is getting more and more crazy. However, the scale that has never been seen before is already overwhelmed,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the chaos of the enemy, Richard sneered, his hand waved, the law The regiment and the sect of the gods began to add the gain spells to the warriors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors and knights remained motionless, even a group of statues, even The Frost Blade Knights who stand out from the crowd are also motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations for this army are in an orderly manner. His strength is less than 3,000, and the opposite is more than five. 10,000, the speed of the whole team is far faster than the other side, and under the shadow of the thundercloud, the army of Sinai will only become more and more chaotic,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside Thundercloud, Richard not only increased his resistance to Sinai's power, but the power of his real name, Salong Raven, was the core. After the power of Raven was attached, the thundercloud had more natural flavor, although this would weaken the single. The power of lightning, but the speed of thundercloud itself has nearly doubled, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suspended in midair, looking at the army of Sinai, his eyes I have seen a victory,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just then, one The church knight suddenly pulled out the short sword and stabbed into the midfielder of the cardinal who was still yelling, causing his cry to suddenly stop. The cardinal suddenly looked back and pointed at the church knight. Unbelievable, but can't say a word,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
