			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cold iron throne is swaying in the rain, just at this time, not moving The deep red Principality of the Principality began to move forward again, and the bleak march into the horn sounded a cold snap in the hearts of every imperial person. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attack was a 10,000-strong force consisting of a humanoid knight, a squadron knight and a local elite warrior, accompanied by a large number of pastors and mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of the Principality generally has a level of six or seven, and the combat power has been above the Imperial Army of the Iron Triangle Empire, but they are not siege The main force is responsible for transporting a large number of earth and stone. An upward slope channel is piled up under the wall. With the help of a large number of mage muds and even the earth magic, a pile of ten meters wide and nearly thirty meters are quickly piled up. The stone slope of the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Division in the Imperial City also began to organize counterattacks, but because the commanding heights were suppressed by Thundercloud, it became extremely difficult for them to destroy the resistance of the siege passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city gate is the most densely populated area of ​​thunderclouds. Originally, there are fewer mages who specialize in naturalization. When they give up the defensive spells and join the siege confrontation, The soldiers here began to suffer heavy casualties. The humanoid knights below constantly shot the explosion arrows. Thunder and explosions continued to level the defenders on the tower, and then a new batch of new forces would rush to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slopes of the siege have been piled up, and the army of the Principality has suddenly retreated. It has been running 100 meters away and is in doubt. At that time, there was a sudden loud noise between the heavens and the earth. For a time, everyone could not hear any sound. They just watched a huge fire column rushing into the sky, and the soldiers standing on the castle floor could not help but fly. Some even flew hundreds of meters and then screamed and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial warriors who have come back to see the huge towers that have been somewhat skewed, and all of them are sluggish and do not understand what happened. The Cold Iron Throne is the mainland. The famous giant city, the last expansion, is now the gate of the Imperial Capital is extremely strong, known as the shining door of the sky, is the essence of the wisdom of the Millennium Triangle family experience, it is said that the gods are also difficult to strike, the city gate The startup is turned off, and all need magic power to push. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just look at the incomparably huge momentum, it seems that only miracles can be used to describe, is the gods have abandoned the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Li looked at the tower that had been tilted but never collapsed, and opened the door of a small slit. He shook his head and sighed: "It’s so strong that even ten tons of dwarf gunpowder can’t blow up the gate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dip at the moment, so there are several huge cracks on the connected wall. However, through the crack, Richard actually saw the thickness of a fist. The steel bar saw this structure, and Richard also extinguished the heart of the wall. He issued the command of the general attack. Countless humanoid knights began to charge and attacked the wall along the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slope is still some distance from the city wall, but the magic rider can already rush directly to the city with the help of the force. The humanoid knight is superior to the emperor in terms of strength and equipment. The middle-ranking officer is equivalent to the squadron leader in the Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of humanoid knights are constantly coming to the wall, they are like a black tide, tearing open the imperial defense line in the blink of an eye, throwing into the city, seeing The city is breaking, and countless imperial warriors have succumbed to the humanoid knights. The ordinary enemies may be shocked by their bravery, but the humanoid knight never knows what to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front row of hundreds of humanoid knights suddenly broke away from the battlefield, suddenly accelerated into the emperor, the surrounding imperial warriors surged up, and The humanoid knights just pointed the long rifle at the sky and then tried their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slap in the sky, the sky is full of thunderclouds, and the energy is stirred up. Under the blast, the humanoid knight can resist the damage and can not resist the power of lightning. Even the people are riding and being shot into coke, but in the storm, the densely-pulled lightning is intertwined into the power grid, raging around, surrounded by humanoid knights. Nearly a hundred imperial warriors around the city also fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch of humanoid knights rushed out again, and suicided dozens of times the imperial warriors were sent to no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of the third batch of humanoid knights, a huge hollow has appeared on the front line of the entire emperor, and tens of thousands of elite fighters have died. Crawling the earth's thunder and lightning net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released so much energy, the thunderclouds in the sky calmed a lot, but the emperor did not feel a little relaxed, because the tower has been publicly Occupation, the huge and heavy city gate was slowly opened with the joint efforts of more than ten knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of the city finally opened, and the army of Richard swarmed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial party originally thought it should be an extremely fierce street fighting, but the result was a one-sided rout, the public team seems to be more familiar with the cold iron than the emperor The terrain of the throne, whenever the emperor wants to fight an ambush, will find that it is facing the enemy from the back and even the three sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pentagon Square, Mosbian Grand Temple, Slum Loton District, these areas with heavy troops were taken down one by one, the public team divided into dozens The road, repeated interspersed, cut the emperor into more than a dozen units in isolation, and then encircle them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was smooth and the majority of people expected, at this time, Saranwell was also sent to the side of Richard, overlooking the entire battle from the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a block, thousands of imperial warriors are relying on complex terrain to resist, and they successfully repelled several attacks by Crimson. In exchange for a valuable short-term breathing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the air, Jarenwell saw that the frontal attack of the public was only to drag these empires, and the other two were Quickly rushed in, and copied the imperial army from the side, and soon the three public squadrons surrounded the emperor, and with a huge advantage of 3,000 to 1,000, it took less than half an hour to end the battle. Then they turned into two paths and split up to the other two battlefields. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of the Red Clan entered the Imperial Army with only 50,000 or 60,000 people, but they are like huge and sophisticated war machines, constantly and effectively destroying the living forces of the opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville took a deep breath and said, "I finally understand that it was not awkward to lose to you in the past. On the battlefield of this scale, I It may take five times the strength to be able to resist a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just smiled and said nothing, at the moment he was actually quite relaxed, because most of it The commanding work is carried out by the thinkers and the brains. What Richard needs to do is only the strategic level of decision-making, such as pointing out the areas that need to focus on the attack, and coordinating the commanders to suppress the towns and cities that killed the iron triangle empire. That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation was still a little unexpected, and Richard suddenly moved in the direction of the emperor’s palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a distance, the Imperial Palace raised a pale yellow mask and covered the entire Imperial City. Li immediately immediately mobilized the brain and flew to the Wangcheng, which is halfway up the mountain. At this moment, the entire emperor is still stifling. However, the main force of the Principality has already pushed into the outside of Wangcheng, and is confronting the defending army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several soldiers carried Gangde down, and two others joined forces to take advantage of Gangde’s quasi-legendary axe, but this giant axe has been seriously distorted. Even if it can be repaired, the quality will drop. Gangde himself is covered in blood. There are more than ten scars on the body. The deepest wound has almost cut off most of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Gangde reluctantly propped up his upper body and said with a smile: "Hey, these guys are all huddled in Wangcheng, I rushed up." I tried it and they suddenly opened a weird protective cover. Then I was beaten by a dozen people. You have to be careful. In this protective cover, our actions will be greatly limited, and those The guys are all unaffected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a point and patted Gangde’s shoulder and said, "Is it so reckless to see you next time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Richard turned back and said: "Go and take over the Popes of the Three Goddesses and treat Gangde!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A squadron with a sub-brain carrying a command, immediately flew back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard is still on the shoulder of Gangde, and there is a round of azure moon on the top of the head, and the colorful flowers bloom everywhere. The thunder and lightning on the black soil seemed inconspicuous, but the horrible wounds of Gangde immediately began to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the moon of Azure is fleeting, the wound of Gangde is only a small reduction in the wound, the blood slowly solidifies, but his injury is completely Stabilize, there will be no life worry within a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no enclosed city wall in the scope of Wangcheng. The main road up the mountain is the avenue for eight horses to reach the mountainside. The heading is a huge one. Semi-circular squares, decorated with green vines and metal pillars intertwined into a fence, you can clearly see the gates of the Imperial Palace just a few hundred meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are constantly shining magic symbols on the gates and on the outer walls. The light yellow curtains extend to the periphery of the square. The breath is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
