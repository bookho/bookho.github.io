			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course was placed in a huge room that can accommodate 300 people. In the classroom, in the middle of the classroom is a high platform with more than a dozen large and comfortable locations, in stark contrast to the crowded seats on both sides. When Richard entered the classroom, he was directly led to the central high platform. In an instant, hundreds of eyes fell on him, making Xiao Li feel uncomfortable. The students sitting in the classroom are all ages, from seven or eight-year-old children to more than eighty old magicians. This is the content of a semi-public professor, as long as the mages who have served the dark blue for one year can come to the class. The central high platform is an area reserved for Su Hailun's pro-disciples. So when Richard sat down, he immediately became the focus of the audience. Envy and hate, look at everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Richard, there is a teenager and a girl in the central area. They are two or three years older than Richard, but they are the magicians of the sixth and fifth grades respectively. Su Hailun received a total of 12 students, Richard is the thirteenth, and there are still three people who are still studying in the dark blue. The rest have begun to travel on the mainland and even the ectopic plane, and the most outstanding people have begun to dominate the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just sat down, the main entrance of the classroom is pushed open, and walks into a stout and bald magician. **Victor, the 16th-level magician, the mana is not in the dark blue, and it can only be relegated to the ranks of the strong on the whole continent. However, **Victure is not dominated by magical ranks, but is famous for its theoretical achievements in the world system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Victor’s appearance is not good, even the face of the big nose and round chin is a bit funny, but there are people in the classroom who are interested in furthering in the magical world. The opportunity to sit in the dark blue to listen to the class is not easy, so the classroom is quiet immediately, waiting for the master speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of magic lies in reality. When you observe the world, what you see and hear is not real, but through your perception, The image of the world projected in your consciousness! This process is inevitable, and it seems to be very unimportant, but it is because of the existence of this process that there is an indispensable relationship between the world we perceive and the real world. Gap. So how to reduce the error? You can only rely on your way of thinking! It can even be said that the way a magician thinks determines what kind of world he sees."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, waiting or confused, or thoughtful thoughtful apprentices and magicians to write down what they said, **Vicvin continued: "In the next time, What I can teach you is not the powerful eight-level magic, but even the nine-level magic, because I will not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom is quiet, There is no sneer in the expectation of wiki. In the face of this group of students with a positive attitude and a serious expression and full of respect for the teacher, he can only helplessly touch the bald head and muttered: "A bunch of boring guys. Well, we went straight to the subject." I will teach you how to think, don't underestimate it. In fact, it is the cornerstone of everything, which determines what you can achieve in a magical world. The correct way of thinking can be seen by you. Closer to the truth of the world, so that the right decision can be made in the important choices, not to make a decision to let yourself regret life as a headless fly. The so-called important choices include both magic experiments and the choice of magic in battle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To summarize my system with one word is top-down. You have to remember that you must first know the world before you can recognize yourself. If like this Everyone in the magic tower is propagating everything from the self, you can only see a small piece around the place. This determines your life's achievements are limited. How can a housefinch be able to ?!! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp eagle on a par with that guy so it does not like that way of thinking, is simply a prairie gopher "<br <br /> & nbsp />;After viciously slamming for ten minutes, ‘one of the guys in this magic tower’, **Vickey began to formally official content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the original is the foundation of everything. Our world is based on the power of the original, and gradually with the expansion of the original force. Expansion. The power of the original is incomparably grand. So far we have no way to use it. We can regard the original force as an origin, and our world, and even the countless worlds that may exist, hang at this point. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rules constitute the framework of our world, and the myriad planes are the flesh and blood of the world. The rules are higher than the planes, and the planes are based. A plane is a concrete manifestation of one or several rules. The more rules a plane can carry, the larger it is, the higher the plane in the world, and the perfect plane with plural rules, such as It is said that the plane of the land of Nolande under our feet is such a high-level plane. We also call it the main plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking here You will understand that the rules and planes are completely integrated. To become strong, it is necessary to follow the rules, not the opposite. Violation of the rules will inevitably be punished. Do not think that if you are strong, you can ignore the rules. Unless you feel that you can fight against the whole plane, it is possible to change or even break the basic rules. Under the basic rules, there are secondary rules that are derived. It is the object that you can be obsessed with! Attention, obscenity! The meaning of the word "obscenity" means that you have no ideals that you can achieve in your lifetime. Miracles are always there, but don't expect them to appear on you! Now you should understand the importance of understanding the world. The strong will use and even challenge the derivative rules. Only fools will go to the basic rules."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rules determine the basic characteristics and power system of the plane. In a later unlikely future, you may also cross the plane to complete the conquest. At that time, Analysis of the derivative rules and power system of the plane is your top priority. Only after completing this step can you adjust your combat mode and focus on Allocate resources to make the most of the plane environment, not to be limited by it. In the process, there is one of the most important things, do you know what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;** 维奇 screamed, and soon became dry. After pouring a whole jar of magical pure water into his stomach, he screamed: "Eternal and the dragon of time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and the Dragon of Time It has almost supreme status in the mainland of Noland, and is above many gods. Its power is incredible, it does not require faith, and it is unpredictable. The Dragon of Eternity and Time has its own temple, the Eternal Dragon Hall. The Eternal Dragon Hall is almost the most important place on the mainland, because only here can communicate with the dragon of eternity and time. The position and number of the Eternal Dragon Hall are fixed, unalterable, and unaffected by changes in time and space. Before the record of the oldest ethnic civilization, the Temple of Eternal Dragons already existed on the mainland. The magical civilization of Noland's continent, regardless of race or location, is deeply influenced by the Eternal Dragon Hall. It is precisely by its guidance that human beings can develop a magical civilization that is not inferior to elves and dragon blood dwarfs from a race that is weak and can only rely on fertility, and builds three great empire with great power and vast expanse. Other races are also deeply influenced by the Eternal Dragon Temple, which is based on the ruins of the Eternal Dragon Temple that have been discovered in all continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This old dragon is almost a rule of existence, it took its own paw prints in countless planes! When you enter one In the new plane, the goal of the final level is to find traces left in that world. It is a mother dragon, an egg, or something else. Even if it is just a pile of dragon dung, as long as it is found, it can Let you immediately understand the rules of the plane, and thus become the real powerhouse between the planes! Compared with this old dragon, the so-called gods are just the parasites in the rules. The lesser rules are the weak gods. The rule is more powerful. You see, the world is so simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
