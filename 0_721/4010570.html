One was attached to the sword by Richard Chang Jian, several rotating swords were nailed to the ceiling, and the other was the first sword. It was forced by Richard to turn to the attack, and then the sword in his hand was inexplicably smashed three times and dropped off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understated defeated three sacred-level hunters, but Richard did not show joy, but gestured to the two big Druids to continue the contest, first According to the orthodox tactics, the name Druid first blessed various defenses. As a result, Richard’s sword swayed, and the sword slashed with brilliance, and a sword smashed on Druid’s defensive shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword fell, the big Druid immediately flew out of the sky, Richard clearly took the ordinary sword, the magical light attached to the sword Not strong, but when a sword comes down, he feels at least three different magic effects, energy annihilation, weakened defense, shield piercing, which is the magic that makes the defense a headache, but the sword is three All of them are just a sword. The magic defense of the big Druid is turned into nothingness. The face of Richard is as calm as water, the sword is falling again, the color of the sword is changed, the elements are weakened, the armor is brittle and the shield is shocked. There are three different magics, each of which is a nemesis of magical defense effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard’s long sword was bounced again, the face of Grand Druid was green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield has already defeated his last magical defense field, even more terrible is the weakening of the element and the armor of the armor has greatly weakened his magic resistance and * *Strength, Druid, who is known for his skin and thick meat, is more vulnerable than ordinary people. Just like a knight, not only is the armor stripped, but even the underwear is stripped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Richard’s third sword was just patted on the shoulders of Grand Druid and said, “Next.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two swords are actually lightning fast, but it is this short time, this big Druid has been sweaty, and the third sword of Richard can shoot his shoulder, He can also cut his head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big Druid is also defeated neatly, and Richard’s sword comes with three kinds of breaking effects, that is, he prepares more spell defenses in advance. Useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Richard glanced at the old wizard, shook his head and threw the long sword to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big Druids are actually the effect of Richard’s all-in-one suit, except for the effectiveness of the three separate structures. Gray actually has two suiting abilities. One is the name of the suit. Everything is gray. This ability allows Richard to attach up to three magic effects to any attack, or add a prisoner attack, or make the fire magic powerful. Ascension, while the other suit effect is hidden and inconspicuous, because Richard connects all the components into a whole and manipulates them with an independent consciousness through the immovable heart, so Richard's casting speed of any magic Both have been accelerated, while mana consumption has dropped by more than 20%. The more advanced the magic, the more obvious the effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, in the hard battle with Iskara, Richard’s wisdom talent has always been at the limit of the limit, and finally broke through to the sixth-order, and the speed of thinking is not only improved. It speeded up Richard's parsing of rules and finally surpassed the speed of the Sanctuary level, thus substantially affecting the results of the Richard War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard calmly sat down, suddenly a set of data jumped out of consciousness, let him slightly glimpse, that is, the progress of the battle mode progressed a little Step, jumped from 26% to 27%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wisdom talent evolved to the sixth stage, it finally had the ability to fully analyze a certain direction of the battle, but with Richard’s practice of life. It was not the same. At that time, Richard practiced madly and tried to make a perfect knife. Only then did he have a fight, but at that time, the so-called perfect knife actually had quite a number of premise restrictions, but it was mainly based on life. It is not enough to consider the magical armed forces and all kinds of magical aids. Now the wisdom talent analyzes not only the swordsmanship, but the analysis of the physical attack as the main combat mode, and the analysis is based on all available magic and everything. On the basis of the gray suit, it is a comprehensive analysis of the use of various weapons. In fact, it has already belonged to the category of combat art. When the comprehensive analysis is completed, even if all the conditions remain unchanged, the real combat power of Richard will be improved. Nearly doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the three sacred hunters, Richard and their power are roughly the same, but they can't resist Richard's three strokes. If Mellin is going all out, she may be able to support it for a long time, but she will definitely not support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the battle mode analysis is easy and difficult, but with a few Yongye elves tried a few strokes to make the analysis progress 1%, or let Li Chapo For the sake of accident, Richard briefly understood that he would fight more opponents of different combat styles in the future. More reference can greatly speed up the analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the magic-led battle, the amount of information that needs to be processed is too complicated and huge, and the analysis progress is slow so that Richard can give up directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the cuts of these eternal night elves are not that Richard wants to show his strength, but to understand their power in this respect. As long as Richard has real insights, it is enough to just move them with them. In fact, Richard’s understanding of Melin can no longer be thorough, put her in, just tell her in the eyes of Richard, now she Nothing special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting in his seat, Richard said: "Now, talk about the situation of the tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves looked at each other, and finally a big Druyi hesitated to open his mouth. Richard listened quietly, but his eyebrows wrinkled unconsciously, and the anger between the eyebrows gradually began. Revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yongye tribe currently has more than 1,300 members, slightly more women, about seven hundred, and about 600 qualified fighters. The hunter's qualified soldiers are about 350, plus more than 30 Druids of all levels, which constitute the core strength of the Yongye tribe. In addition to the elves, about 100 large and small tree people are also one. The stock can not be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Richard, the use of the tree is not great, and this creature is extremely stubborn and casual, not a good fighter, he is more valued The problem is the Eternal Night Elf. The problem is that in order to weaken the resistance of the Yongye tribe, it is also to consolidate its unsteady power. Gray Feather forced the three hunting teams to send out the reconnaissance of the proverbs. Among the three hunting teams A lot of opponents of gray feathers, and in the predetermined direction, waiting for the three hunting teams is the ambush of the absolute superior enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole three hunting teams, more than 150 of the most elite hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, who lacks high-end long-range strike power, this is an extremely heavy loss, and the value of the Yongye tribe has dropped a little. Until now, the arms created by the mother's nest can't replace the real elf hunters. The elite hunters of the night can be around 12th grade. It is enough to be a jazz in the human country. These elite hunters can take a minute. Thirty bonus arrows are sent to the enemy's head. In the explosive state, the rate of fire will be three times that of the normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Elf Hunter has a strong ability to adapt to the terrain, and the movement speed is very fast. The most common equipment of the Green Sens is not enough. It is not a problem here. It is entirely possible to equip them with a full magic longbow and an enchanting long arrow. This hunter force can definitely become an enemy nightmare in the hands of Richard, but now, just for the sake of self-interest, the gray feathers will be ruined by 150. The hunter, if Richard returns later, the loss will continue to expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred and fifty hunters and two hundred hunters are completely different concepts. The high elves are also famous for their slow population growth. With the current size of the Yongye tribe, they want to cultivate 150 elite hunters, at least It took thirty or forty years, so at this moment, the surface of Richard was still calm, but the anger in his heart had already boiled. As for what gray feathers would get from the proverb, Richard did not care at all, and did not want to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, the screams of the gray feathers are still ringing, and he has no strength to issue a hysterical call. Richard’s prison inflammation will not only burn. The first thing that burns is the magic and vindictiveness of the target body. Those who are ignited by prison inflammation will soon lose all the power of resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, Richard said to a big Druid: "Every quarter of an hour, put a recovery on the gray feathers."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big Druid’s face changed slightly. He understood that Richard didn’t want the gray feather to die too fast. According to the frequency of Richard’s, the gray feather might have to be tortured. It will die all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, everyone goes back to rest, start tomorrow, prepare for the war with the proverb." After Richard finished, he said to Melin: "You Let's stay first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other night elves left, Richard stared at Melin and said for a long time: "You let me down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline opened her mouth, but she couldn’t say anything. On the same day, Li watched the battle of death, his mood was too stirring, and when he left in a hurry, Giving the green sky to Mei Lin is equivalent to handing over the entire Yongyue tribe to Mei Lin, but less than half a month before and after, the Yong Ye tribe has an extra-presbyterian church, and finally ruined the whole The three hunting teams, the three hunting teams have many familiar faces, and many childhood partners who grew up with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gray feathers jumped out to form the Presbyterian Church and seized the rights, Melin did not resolutely stop it, she has been opposed, but no To the extent of the use of force, and in the eyes of those who have no lower limit, the use of force to stop is equivalent to consent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a daughter of the forest, Melin is talented but not good at politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and said, "This is not all blaming you, but I have not arranged it, but you hand over the sky of the sky, it Not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
