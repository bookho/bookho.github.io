			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke reached out and subconsciously wanted to take the New Moon to his eyes and observe it carefully. But when the hand was only halfway through, it was in the air and then slowly returned. He knows that he is out of his way. In terms of observing divine power and other forces, the role of the eye is minimal. Everything is likely to be an illusion. It can only rely on the perception of power. The Duke did not think that the little guys in front could fake in front of him, even though Richard was an eleventh-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Duke remembered what Richard had just said, and solemnly asked: "You just said that the true God is the eternal and time dragon?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When spit out the eternal and time-honored syllables, there was a slight tremor in the unpredictable voice of the Duke. Nothing else, it is the name of the dragon of eternal and time. It is too shocking. If you carefully think about the meaning, it is totally unbelievable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All life has a limit, even if the legendary strong has a fallen day. Like human beings, the gods are not eternal. They rise, ignite the fire, grow stronger, achieve higher power, gain more priesthood, build a more magnificent kingdom of God, and then decline, fall, and be replaced by new gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the gods will continue to die in the plane, yes, the plane will die, but the process is sometimes so fast that the creature can feel it, sometimes It seems to be eternal. When the plane disappears, the gods of this plane will die together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of a god is not random, mostly accompanied by the formation of a fire, the gods are solid, and the gods are self-named and inform the believers. The name of God is directly related to the priesthood and divine power. Most of the time it is accurate. In rare cases, there is also the possibility of exaggeration, such as the god of time, Sinai. This is to spread the need for faith, and the exaggerated part does not conflict with other gods. In the Faro plane, there is no second God with time-related priesthood, so Sinai is likely to call itself the god of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill is also in contact with Sinai’s priests to understand Sinai’s power. But now that he sensed the power of the Eternal and Time Dragon, the Duke immediately knew that Sinai's name was exaggerated, and he had never thought of it a few minutes ago. Sinai's divine power can distort the time flow, but it will return to normal after the effect. Just like blocking a river, once it is opened, the silted river will pour out. Under the power of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, the rules of time have changed radically. It's like turning a stream into a big river, not just building a dam on the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal and Time Dragon, Eternal and Time Dragon..." The Duke repeatedly chewed the name of the god that he had never heard before, and was a little lost. In fact, this is not surprising, mainly the word eternal is really shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sits quietly, savoring the Duke’s top-grade black tea, as if his eyes are now only the cup of tea in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal and time priesthood, and the characteristics of not needing faith, then this dragon should really be above the plane, so that it does not need to take the position The power of faith inside the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If..." The Duke quickly calmed down and said to Richard: "The power of eternal and timeless dragons is consistent with its name, so Isn't it possible to give a kind of grace to prolong life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is waiting for this sentence. He looked up and greeted the Duke to see the hearts of the people, to say as lightly as possible: "This is the case, this is the core of the eternal and the dragon of time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the duke nodded, he did not ask again. Instead, he asked, "How do you get the grace of the eternal and the dragon of time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the key It is. Richard has long prepared a well-thought-out answer: “First, there needs to be a minimum of awe and faith; then, it is to prepare sacrifices and sacrifice through specific altars, so that God can be given. God gives size, generally It depends on the sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds similar to the sacrifice of the ancestors. What kind of sacrifice is sacrificed? Livestock? Warcraft? Or slave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A variety of items with powerful power attributes and ... creatures. In addition, some sacrifices with unique attributes may also cause interest in the Eternal and Time Dragon." Li said. He carefully considered the word bio, but the word is not very accurate, because Richard believes that if a god, such as the god of time, Sinai, is sacrificed, the gods won’t get it. It is an extra life of tens of thousands of years. If a person is gifted and has enough luck, these times are enough to ignite the fire. At this time, after listening to Richard’s instructions, the duke laughed and said, “So, if I can give the god of time, Sinai. Sacrifice, can you live more than a few thousand years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Richard’s turn to be shocked, and he watched the Duke of God who had nothing to say. Then I turned my head and glanced at the sand, and said, "This is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke smiled and threw a key question: "Since you want to offer Sacrifice, then the altar is very important. Can you always move the altar from the ectopic plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, we need to build a new altar Said, Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core purpose of this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke indulged for a moment, saying: "If in the name of ancestor worship, it is okay. But since the sacrifice is so important to the Eternal and Time Dragon, then the construction of the altar Is there a special request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the sand, and the sand nodded and answered the question: "In order to be stable and eternal and the dragon of time Communicate and deliver sacrifices, the altar needs powerful power. This power is mainly stimulated by the first sacrifice, so a sacrifice of a sufficient level is needed. Secondly, the construction of the altar itself requires a lot of magic materials, which I can provide. A detailed list, but I don't know if there is enough material in the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very feasible..." The Duke meditated, a pair The tall and straight eyebrows are gradually locked together, and obviously an important decision is difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of Richard is still calm, but the heart is inevitably nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s reaction is very different from what he had expected, and it seems that he is not very keen on the possibility of getting a longer life. If the Duke of the Wolf has no interest in eternal life, then the greatest reliance on Richard's position in this position will become a trap. The only thing that makes him feel safe is that faith cannot be deceived, or it is difficult to deceive. If the Duke wants to receive God's grace, then he must really help them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black tea in the Licha Cup has already been finished, he just subconsciously rubbed the cup. Time passed by bit by bit, and the pleasant living room didn't know when it became stuffy. Richard began to ooze a layer of fine oil and sweat, which was very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
