			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Ferdinand again and felt a slight moment in his eyes. The sting of the heart, so I have a glimpse of my heart. In the Faro plane, Richard has raised himself to the 12th level. After he is strong, he is more able to know the power of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard does not know that Ferdinand’s desire to promote the legend is actually very simple, just need Vatican to invest in grace. Because he is actually the guardian of the Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with Richard is that under what circumstances the plane portal will be destroyed and the plane number will disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Greeks told the Richards that the portal was destroyed. There was a possibility that the extraordinary impact of the time could destroy the portal. Therefore, it is extremely important to construct the material of the portal, but it is impossible to increase the cost endlessly. This requires a balance value in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the plane number disappears, he hopes that there are only two cases in the past, one is that the plane is completely destroyed, and the other is that the person with the plane number voluntarily gives up the position. Face, but that is also possible when the plane is almost completely absurd, and there is no value. Otherwise, the Eternal Dragon Hall will not be accepted. However, the disappearance of the Qiqi plane number obviously does not belong to the above two situations, and she has no reason to infer. Perhaps the real answer is to look for it from the Mensa family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought deeply for a moment, then said, "Okay, I understand. Now I have two places that need the help of the Eternal Dragon Temple. First, I want to pass." The portal to the Faro plane is located in the temple, for example, in this side hall, for a period of one year. On the other hand, I want to apply to some temple knights to help me guard the floating island 7-2." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyce and Nolan whispered for a while and looked at the quicksand and said: "The original two requirements are impossible to promise you. Because the Eternal Dragon Temple should not be involved in the secular rights struggle. But you have sacrificed more than the high-level ritual sacrifices, and the gods of the sand, the book of artifact time has grown significantly, so you can Extraordinary exceptions allow you to get help from the Eternal Dragon Temple at the expense of sacrifice. Your first requirement will be to use the time as a standard to convert the price. In the time of the existence of the portal, a minimum level is required every six months. The sacrifice of the sacrifice, a year of the year is a medium-level sacrifice. Protection 7-2 The term of the floating island is also one year, because this floating island has just received the grace of the Eternal and Time Dragon. If any family attacks it within a year, it can also be regarded as a eternal dragon temple. Disrespect. As for the specific guard plan, you can ask the adult Ferdinand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand said at this time: "I can transfer fifty Knights of the Temple to you. Let them station on the floating island 7-2. But my knight only guarantees that the floating island is not invaded by other families, I will not intervene in the internal disturbances of Archimonde."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and said: "Fifty knights don't seem to be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fedinand smiled and said: "Not enough If you want, you can add another low-level sacrifice to every 50 knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee's double eyebrows wrinkled deeper, quieted down, silently calculated And thinking. He did not shy away from the process of cautiousness and thinking. Instead, he let the two great priests and the legendary guards of the heavens secretly nod. It is impossible to be cautious about the three low-level sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes passed, Richard’s face was pale. There are too many factors he needs to consider. Even with wisdom, it takes a long time to make a decision. "Feddinand, there are fifty Knights of the Temple, a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand applauded and said with a smile: "Good! What about the sacrifice?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know if these things can replace the sacrifices?" Richard put the two drawers in front of the enchanted cloud iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan Grandi is also a master-level appraiser. She picks up a cloud of iron ingots and carefully looks at it and says, "It is indeed an enchanted cloud iron ingot." Excellent quality, all these values ​​can be converted into two low-level sacrifices, but not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no fixed between gold coins and sacrifices The conversion relationship, depending on the situation, the price of low-level sacrifices will fluctuate between 300,000 and 700,000 gold coins. The price given by Nolan is roughly 500,000, which is reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Richard checked and said, "I am going to hold my own assembly conference in two days, and I will sell a few pieces of decoration." The part owed should be returned at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey smiled and said: "The promise of a future sacred architect is far more than a few 100,000 gold coins are precious. It doesn't matter, we can wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan big sergeant who has never talked suddenly said: "Licha, your makeup Can the press conference be postponed for one day, that is, after three days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The difference in one day does not seem to be big, but Richard’s words from Nolan I heard some other meanings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan the great official said faintly: "You have a lot of trouble with Archimonde. If your press conference can be postponed, I think I can find a few Supporters, let your press conference go smoothly. In addition, one of the more important reasons is that three days later, the Royal Architect Luno released a new build. I heard that the Alliance Royal Family is thinking about adding new ones. The Royal Builder, if you can shine enough at this time, you may be selected as a royal builder. The meaning of this identity, you don't need to say that you should understand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha thinks silently, after a moment he resolutely says, "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He promised so easy and fast, but let Nolan have Curious: "Are you not afraid of offending Luno?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, what Li thinks is, but it is mysterious, but far away. The deep blue sighs, when he heard Nolan’s doubts, he sighed and said, “Luno will always be overtaken by me, but it’s only a matter of time. Already, do you mean to make me and Luno an enemy? This should be a prerequisite for becoming a royal builder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan With a glance at the eyes, he smiled and said: "You are very smart! I am also looking forward to your performance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, under the escort of two eternal dragon knights Licha left the Temple of Eternal Dragon and walked to the floating island to go to the temple. Just left the Eternal Dragon Hall and walked on the road leading to the Temple of Transmission. On the way, there were a few young people dressed in bright and luxurious, and with a dozen or so low-level guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this group of people passed by with Richard, one of the young people’s eyes fell on Richard and suddenly snorted and exclaimed: Isn't this the investigation of Archimonde's family? Has he returned from the ectopic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
