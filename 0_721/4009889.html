			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also rules and order in the bloody land, it is very simple, but Effective. That is the principle of basic strength, the principle of strength and wealth matching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is simple to say that it is necessary to have enough capacity to protect themselves in this land. If your strength is above the baseline, you can have the wealth and status that match your strength. In fact, these two rules are similar to each other. They are naturally formed in the disorderly struggle for many years. It is not so much a rule, but rather a wisdom of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the blood-stained area, the Gobi lions standing at the top of the common beast food chain will meet each other if they meet on the way, and they will scream each other and test the strength of each other. After passing the bottom line, they passed by and each forage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most places of the blood-stained land, including the blue-water oasis, the rules of passage are no different from the Beast World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the experience that Richard talked with the old man looking at the grocery store for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has passed, and the bloody incident last night will naturally be the talk of people in today's Oasis City. Stigk, who was hanged, quickly became the most repeated word in people's mouths. Although it sounds very exciting, but for people who have been walking on the blade for many years, this is just the case. Even a lot of daring people have gone to visit the exhibition hall outside the camp. Through this exhibition, they read more of Richard's determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard entered the city again in the early morning, still carrying the last ones. But the bar has closed, and this morning, Richard is not for drinking. So when he saw that the grocery store had already opened the door, and the old man was still sitting around doing nothing, he sat down with the old man and chatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that his men would not be polite with Strick’s industry, they opened the door of the bar directly, scared that several of them survived and nowhere to go. Go to the hostess and scream again and again. But now is not the time of killing. They just moved out of the wine and the table and sat down casually. The position just guarded Richard tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big night last night obviously made people in this bustling street remember the memory of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of large and small shops on this street. Many shopkeepers, like the old people in the grocery store, sit idle at the door, very long I can't see any customers coming to the door. Although some of the goods were piled up in their shops, most of them were broken and broken. At first glance, they knew that they couldn’t get a few dollars. They were completely used to install the facade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s grocery store is quite full of things, but it’s very strange that such a shop is on this street and next to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But chatting with the old man for an hour, Richard knows that the shops on this street are indeed working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every shop actually has a force behind it, and the type and size of the store hints at the real business behind the forces. For example, a hide shop means the orc slave trade, and a clothing store is a barbarian trade. Shops specializing in desert stone carvings can often find a large number of slaves. In addition to normal spirits and women, the bar also provides services such as harvesting heads and horses. If Richard sees who is not pleasing to the eye, he can spend a sum of money to hire the Strick's cavalry and kill it in the middle of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a mistake for Richard to buy the news, but his appearance is too young, too delicate, and incompatible with the blood-stained land, not only a completely strange face, but also a passer-by. The most important thing is that he started to buy too much money to buy news, at least ten times beyond the normal price, which caused the greed of the bartender, and there is a series of stories behind. You know, Strick's cavalry costs only half a day for gold, and the captain is two, and if there are fifty gold coins a day, Stick himself doesn't mind running once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the grocery store for the elderly, it is actually the sale of all kinds of rare materials, including the embargo of many human kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard immediately became interested in the business of the elderly, and the topic gradually deepened. Later, Richard heard some words that made him excited, such as Maple Amber, Flying Snake, and Lafite Iron Ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provocatively ask, who is the owner of this store?" Richard pointed to the grocery store and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grocery store is small, but there are only two similar shops on the entire long street. The identity of the old man makes him feel curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and said, "Tell you nothing. These are all public secrets. My grocery store belongs to Anrik, which is commonly known as the strength." The one of the Marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the tradition of this plane, if you add a strength prefix in front of the title, it means that the noble is a public Different, perhaps the blood of the royal family or heroes, perhaps there are special resources in the territory and the ability to retain, perhaps a strong hero of their own or their subordinates, perhaps enjoying the gods... no matter which One reason is that their strength and influence are beyond the normal strength represented by the title, but only because of certain factors, they have not obtained a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very attractive," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded and said, "It is true. In recent years, I am getting old, and the fire is not as big as before. I prefer to have someone to chat." So, for you, the attraction of my store should really be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the followers behind Richard, the old man continues to say: "You Very young and very good, these guards are not simple. It seems that you not only have a very strong family, but also a very great teacher. Only stupids like Stick will have a man with short eyes. I thought you could eat it as a young child." The old man smiled twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From last night, the attitude of the elderly to Richard has been very gentle, as if facing a dangerous outsider, but indeed as his own A good chat object: "Stick has paid the price for his stupidity, but it is not so easy to end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee freely stretches After a moment, I said, "I admit that I have a little bit of weight in this matter. But I believe that this trouble is nothing to the power of the Marquis. My teacher has taught me long ago, professional things must be professional. People do it. I believe that there are many people in various professions in this city. The Marquis is perhaps the most professional one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clever little guy." The old man nodded and nodded and said, "But why is the Marquis the power to solve the trouble for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I and Allek There is a lot of business that can be done between adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
