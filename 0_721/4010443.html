The so-called instant magic also takes a little time to call the magic power, which may be shorter for most people than a breath, but Richard seized the flashing gap and stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magister did not realize that he was alive and dead until he was taken up in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a matter of moments, Richard has already won a magical mentor far beyond his own in the face of a legend and two powerful sanctuaries, though Richard has a suspicion of raids, but this is still waiting for the four strong, especially the legendary mage slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao took the big magician and looked around for a week before he said faintly: "Do you think that I don't dare to do it, obviously you want to be wrong, black Master Master, how do you plan to deal with black cockroaches." There is a very dangerous signal in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Hastings did not mean to be angry at all, but instead showed a smile, although his face was covered with a wrinkled face. Breath, but it is really laughing, and quite pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage, known for his bad temper, does not seem to be offended by Richard’s actions. The purple-black eye bags are falling to the ground, as if they were When something interesting happened, he asked: "You said it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent, he naturally knows what is in the magical biology, these are The common sense of magic has been systematically studied in the dark blue. The Greenson's face, the Bear Peter Lab, is a classic display of magical biology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Hastings has clearly stated his attitude, then Richard turned to the big magician and asked: "You expropriate my things, if I Disagree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is calm, but the extremely dangerous atmosphere is more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee released his hand, and his feet finally stepped on the ground, and the big magician instinctively pressed the painful throat and instinctively wanted to answer: "No Agree is useless." But this sentence came to the lips, but it was not able to export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magister looked at his two fearful companions and then honestly said: "If you disagree, you can go to the round table to vote. If two-thirds of the round table supports the expropriation, then the expropriation It will still be enforced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "There will be a round table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician looked to the legendary mage and said: "His Royal Highness has the right to convene a round table, which can be held immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hastings nodded and agreed, then said: "His Royal Highness, please do not dispose of the black scorpion before the resolution at the round table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin Inspected, and revealed a creepy smile, said: "Of course, I have to wait for this time, because there is still enough time to study him slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The study of this neutral word, said by Hastings, but there is another layer of bloody meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say anything more. His mood was not only relaxed, but heavier. He had vaguely known the outcome of the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom talent, sometimes it is not pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the long magic bells ringed through the sun, and all the strong people looked at the temple area, they knew it was an emergency round table. The sign, but I don’t know that just after a fierce battle, what major events have taken place is urgently needed to hold a round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military camp in Shangcheng District, the marshal Lundstede, who was on tour, also showed a blank expression, and he immediately remembered something, and the eyebrows were immediately locked together. In the city defense zone, Lawrence also heard the bell, the old man's expression was complicated, just sighed and accelerated the treatment on his hand, and rushed to the temple area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, more than a dozen people with the highest status in the capital are gathered in the hall of the parliament, sitting around the round table, waiting for everyone to Qi, the Marshal Guard's great mentor simply stated that after the incident, he quit the temple, and there is no place for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, everyone whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such disputes have appeared for the first time. The situation of expropriation has occurred more than once. In general, Marshal Lundstedt strictly follows the rules and only uses this right if there are sufficient reasons, and The compensation will exceed the original value of the requisitioned property, so there has never been a big dispute in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha raised his hand and got the permission of the marshal. He stood up and said, "You, I want to say that this devil is very special, and He is a living individual, can he come down to the property, let alone this point, the former Mr. Master once said in front of me, even if it is my woman, it may be classified as 'property' The category was then forcibly requisitioned. I just killed the entire Daqsodas. When I came back, I found that the magic person I captured was requisitioned. I didn’t inform me beforehand. If that’s the case, I’m really I don't understand where I am going to fight this battle, just to accumulate wealth, and then let you, his mother, come to requisition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The swearing, but no one accuses him of this. Most people are hearing this for the first time, and now they are still clearing the clues, but many people are shocked by the intense reaction of Richard’s reaction. The target is just a devil, as for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people have expressed the ability to understand Richard’s anger, not because of the value of the item, but because of its dignity, and if this right is abused, it is quite Dangerous, in the end, no matter whether the requisition is finally established or not, at least the Guard's Magister must apologize for his inappropriate remarks, and may even be severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence, who chose to sit next to Richard, smiled a bit and pulled his arm and said: "Lee, calm down first, listen first. What other people said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Lundstedt nodded to Lawrence first, then stood up and said, "First I have to do it here." Clarification, that is, the property acquired is strictly defined, and it can never be expanded at will. The definition of property includes living things of non-intelligent races. Among the intelligent races, only those with clear slave status will be defined as property. At this point, we should be consistent with Noland. As for the devil or other Dakosodas races, for reasons that are well known, we don’t think they should have any rights. This may not be right. But the reason why you are here is not to say that there is a bloody feud with the Dax Sodas, at least for the family, for the country, for the Norland, so in this absolute battlefield, our standards are slightly revised. One I have not treated the Dax Sodas in accordance with the principle of treating the race of wisdom. Therefore, Richard, when I say this, my meaning should be clearly expressed. Your woman can never be used as a property. Someone did say this to you. After verification, he will be punished accordingly and will be expelled from the Marshal Guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the marshal was calm and peaceful, and the explanation was clear. Richard’s original feeling of boiling was slightly calmer, but the sense of heaviness in his heart was stronger. He could almost see the result of the vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is always something in the heart of Richard’s mind, what kind of end will the young devil’s black man fall into the hands of Hastings, Richard’s absolute It is imaginable. He believes that the legendary mage has enough means to let the black scorpion still experience the pain of smashing the whole body every bit, even if there is only one head left. The plane war is never kind. But bloody, perhaps should not be expressed in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal finished, and waited for what Richard said, he said to Hastings: "Hasting, what kind of value does this devil have, or you? Let me explain it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting stood up, first revealing a meaningful smile to Richard, and then said: "This devil Very young and complete. From the perspective of pedigree, he is the royal family of the Danikos, that is, the royal family of the royal family. With him, as long as I give me enough time, I can find out the devil. The Achilles' weakness of the royal family. The value of these weaknesses is that if I encounter the shackles, I will be sure to go with them. Of course, I also promise that you can share the research results, which will make us face all the demons. When people are there, they will have an unprecedented advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of strong people suddenly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil's Skull is a very terrible name. A few decades ago, the realm of this horror demon was close to the superpower, his growth, All were written by the bones of a Nolan strongman. Ten years ago, the shackles suddenly disappeared. No one knows where he went. A guess that makes the Nolanes strong is unforgiving. The Devil's Skull may have begun the process of sprinting to the superpower. If this is the case, then it is definitely not a pleasant news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting is indeed a legendary mage, but if compared with the shackles, the combat power is not at one level, and the shackles are against the magic. The division has great restraint, but now Hastings claims to be able to go with the shackles, even if it is the shackles before the disappearance, it is shocking news, if he can really achieve it, then this The value of the young devil is indeed too large to be measured, and it is likely to change the war pattern of the entire dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee's face was blue, and from Hasting's abnormal persistence, he was faintly guessed that the young devil might be valuable to him, but he did not expect it to be so valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
