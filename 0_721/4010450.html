			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence suddenly attracted everyone’s attention, everyone listened Understood his subtext, that is, the day and night can still hold for up to four hours, four hours, if there is no reinforcement or still refuse to retreat, then including the three legendary temples in the military fortress, Everyone will die in front of the portal of the Legion Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking this sentence is a 20th-level wizard, who has always been known for prophecy spells. This short-term and obvious prophecy is almost There will be no mistakes. When the prophecy is heard, the strong are silent, but a guy whispers: "Don't you can blow up the portal." Because it is too quiet, this sentence All of a sudden broke into the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already this time, the strong people of the day and night have fully proved their courage, but what are they still insisting on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the capital of the day, Lawrence suddenly found himself resting, and did not know when, white night, Richard and The water flower never came back to cure the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, the snoring of the Daksodars seems to be getting closer and closer, and the old man looked up at the ceiling and muttered something. He stood up with his tired body and took out a small dagger in his hand, staring in the direction of the door. He had already exhausted a little magic, leaving only some physical strength to move. St. Lawrence is no better than an ordinary old man, but he feels that he can at least wave his dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood in the room suddenly became thicker. This taste was not generated from the room, but from the outside of the window and outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many places, in countless magic hourglasses, the golden sands are still slowly but firmly rolling down, and every time the sand is like this. heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When another golden sand fell behind, an explosive news suddenly swept all the Norland human empire like the hurricane: the emperor of the Holy Alliance, Bloodthirsty Philip, out of the rising sun, and the two superpowers of Dakosodas launched a decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is moving, which means that Philip has given up the land and gave up the bonus advantage of the Magical Array in the Legion Fortress. The enemy of absolute superiority is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows, if the strong like Philip is degraded, how much influence the entire sacred alliance, even the Noland human empire, some strongmen insist on calmly saying that the Holy Alliance’s town artifact, Charles the Great The giant blade dragon slayer who took the first level of the Abyssal Dragon is now in the hands of Philip, but the real strong is very clear. In the battle of the legendary level, the role of the artifact is also Very limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eternal dragon temple of Faustian, the time hourglass in the hands of Vatican suddenly burst into pieces, and the two blood lines suddenly flowed from her eyes, even her. There is no way to influence the outcome of this level of combat, and even the predictions can not be achieved. After paying a huge price, she is only seriously injured except for the confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, this battle of the peak has a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips and his two guards were carried back to the rising sun, and the two superpowers of Dakosodas were Directly returned to their own plane, the other two legends are one death and one injury, the wounded even the body of the dead compatriots did not recover, they hurriedly fled the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a report from the war, and the strong men suddenly cheered like a tsunami, and then suddenly fell silent, because the most critical piece of information was missing from the battle report, Philip What is the injury of Pu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the imperial transfer of the Millennium Empire, nearly 100 strong people are silent, avoid mentioning the most sensitive topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a warm and jade voice suddenly broke the dead silence: "Everyone let me let, let me pass."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every strong man subconsciously let the road open, and then looked back and looked at the figure that was not so tall and disappeared into the transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still three hours and thirty minutes from the final moment of prophecy. The Wusang Tibetan sword of the Millennium Empire enters the twilight land and appears in the military fortress’s wind and snow dance. In the ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours and three minutes from the final moment, another Dakosodas superpower returned to the position, the two legends were seriously injured, Daxol Das’s blockade of the wind and snow dance landslides collapsed, and the mighty of the Millennium Empire flooded into the dark wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours from the final prediction, a mysterious woman appeared in the capital of the Millennium Empire and strode into the transmission of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is wrapped in a heavy cloak from head to toe, revealing only a pair of bottomless eyes, can not see the slightest of her original appearance, she The biggest feature of the whole body is the amazing giant sword on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade of the Great Sword is one meter wide and four meters long, which is one yard larger than the famous dragons and dragons, but the woman is only It is slightly higher than normal humans. How to swing such a giant sword, the giant sword has no scabbard, only wrapped around the animal skin, and is carried on the woman's back, but it is very stable, and there is no drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s surprising is that this woman seems to be able to walk freely in the Millennium Empire until she enters the magical transmission array. There are many places along the way that are equivalent to military geography. However, no one blocked it, and the strongman in front of the plane sent her to subconsciously let her go a long way until her figure disappeared, only to realize that she should not give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, another gossip began to spread among the strong. It seems that this woman appeared in the country, and the Garan emperor immediately announced that he would take a nap. A nap at a critical moment, in general, this is an excuse for the emperor not wanting to see someone, and who is going to let the Garan emperor avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the final prediction of two hours and fifty-five minutes, this mysterious woman appeared in the wind and snow dance, and then disappeared into the depths of the dark wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two hours and eleven minutes, she returned to the wind and snow dance, sent back to the country capital of the Millennium Empire, and then quietly lost her whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the go, she seems to have no change, but the giant sword behind it is faintly exuding, it seems to be still excited, but already The sharp-eyed strongman found a few small gaps on the sword's front, and watched the woman's distant back. A strong man suddenly lost his voice: "She is the Caroline Snowy Mountain Temple..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words only halfway through, she suddenly grabbed her mouth, the woman in the distance seems to pause, but did not look back, but seems to be slow Flying fast, disappeared into the sky in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several taboo names in the Millennium Empire. One of them is the holy land of all the tribes of the Calando continent. The former warrior of the Snowy Mountain Temple, just a decade ago, was the expeditionary army of the woman who had squandered the Millennium Empire. And captured the emperor's favorite son, she not only captured the goshawk, but also captured his heart, and then there is the mountain and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea have been through the millennial empire, but the goshawk has never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of strong people are guessing why she suddenly appeared in the Imperial Capital, and went to the dusk, but unfortunately no matter how they guessed, they would not get the exact The answer, so even if you hit the facts, there is no way to prove it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last moment, and Faust has suddenly become a lot of fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the exit of the floating island of the Ivy, the Earl of Goliath accidentally saw the Marquis of Sauron, both of whom were fully armed. And they are the costumes of the warriors. They look at each other and almost simultaneously say: "You also want to go to the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the two men screamed at the same time: "It’s all this time, what are you doing, want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, Sauron Golly and Galia glared at each other and shouldered into the transmission line leading to the sun-drenched capital. When they disappeared in the transmission array, there was one hour and fifty minutes from the final prediction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still strong players who have passed through the transmission array to rush to the sun, but the entire sacred alliance is suitable and the willingness to fight is already in the air. All of these people who went to the last place are mostly unable to adapt to the sanctuary of the absolute battlefield. They can only be called the strong in Noland or the ordinary plane war, and they can really contribute to the battle. A few, and not all true powers are willing to fight for the honor of the Holy Alliance. To be honest, the strong who refuse to die are the majority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the final moments of prophecy have not changed for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing is not known, that is, the fourth and the last superpower of Dakso Das has returned to the position. surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of the news is fast and slow, and the people who are dying in the forefront of the line have no time to take care of what happened, and the two emperors gathered together. They are already whispering, and now even if they leave immediately, they can’t reach the end of the day, so the topic they are talking about is all about how to take back the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
