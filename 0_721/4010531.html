			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadrons fell one by one, and the Qiqi Knight also suffered casualties. Later, even Richard’s costume knights equipped with wild battles fell. Three, followers because of their strength, there have been no major casualties, but their magical powers have bottomed out, and the situation is becoming more and more critical. Richard has already adjusted the Knights of the Knights who are entangled with the Knights of the Temple. Coming back, all the troops are condensed into a whole, just like a poisonous snake, which is in a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light is coming and going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A batch of silver glory knights, sacred warriors walked out of the light, killing Richard, there are more than ten angels flying in the sky, always Dive down, throw out a sword or call a Thunder to fight against opponents, but more angels are busy dealing with lightning falling from higher altitudes. There are already more than ten groups of Xingjing Leiyun, and the lightning is continuous. Shoot down, the power of these lightnings has been the size of the fist, a blow is enough to make the Templar warrior, so that the Silver Knight is seriously injured, if not most of the lightning is stopped by the angels, the Silver Knights must be heavy and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the help of the brain-thinking, Richard is also very difficult to command at this moment, and he is still one of the important forces, and he is always a subordinate. Blocking the fatal blow, the smile on Martin's face has long since disappeared, the sweat is coming out like rain, the curly blonde hair is wet, and they are tightly attached to the forehead. The holy code is still flipping fast, and a group of fires are on the page. Flash, every fire, that means the appearance of a summoning warrior, also means the destruction of a page of the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoned warriors attacked from all directions, and across from them, they were killing machines consisting of knights, knights and followers. The summoning warrior is destroyed as quickly as it appears, but every wave of summoning warriors will bring damage to Richard, and his formation will obviously become thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Richard himself was a little shaken, trying to give up the war that didn’t know the end, but he immediately strengthened his confidence and insisted on it for a moment. It will be closer to victory. Richard has not heard of anything that can never summon a warrior. Martin’s origins are mysterious, and the artifact in his hand is strong. It is impossible to summon the legendary Master Su Hailun, Richard. With his own teacher as the standard, as long as the total number of soldiers summoned by Martin exceeds 80% of Su Hailun's strength, Richard is ready to retreat immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two sides are already a contest of will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The super elite of Richard’s sorrow fell one by one, and the holy script in Martin’s hands was burning, and for a moment, he could not tell who’s lost. It will be bigger, but according to worldly standards, it is clear that the value of the Holy Scriptures is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned Silver Knights and Angels are still in full prosperity, Richard’s knights will be tired, and vindictiveness will be consumed, and the power of the Knights of the Front has also been seen. At the end, they began to use their own bodies to block the swords of the opponents and the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has already regarded the Knights of the Front as a consumable. The view of the mother's nest is clear and has a soul, whether it is born or not. Still divinely cohesive, it can be seen as a human being. If there is no soul, it is all consumables, and it reminds Richard of the sneak peek. Looking at the history of Noland and Faro, in the eyes of famous and politicians, soldiers All are consumables. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, seeing those knights who are in the same position with their opponents under their own orders, there will still be a slight sadness in Richard’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war has reached this time, it has become a simple strangulation, the surviving city defense army once thought that saw the opportunity, rushed over and attacked an hour ago, the result In a flash, it was killed and the generals of the city defense army became the victims of the water flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-level temple, the Holy Scriptures turned over again. Martin read in a dry, hoarse voice: "The Lord said... There is no knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The bishop next to him was groggy, and he heard this sentence awakened and could hardly believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin also stunned and reacted to what he said just now. He looked at the holy book in his hand and smiled a bit and said: "There is no "The knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...we..." The bishop looked at the battle, and the priests still mechanically cast the magic, they are the same as the bishop. Their own divine power has already been released, and now the sacred atmosphere of the Great St. Louis Temple is pouring into their bodies, and the priests continue to cast their magical skills. They use their bodies as carriers and are bound to be seriously damaged. It is not known how many people will survive after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We..." Martin handed the holy book, sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s scepter in his hand, resolutely said: “Martin, you are leaving with the Holy Scription now, I will drag them.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the bishop rushed to the battlefield below, but he just took a step and was pulled by Martin. The young cardinal has returned to the sun. The smile, said: "Since even the Lord has no knight, then we will surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" surrender." Richelieu could not believe his own again. ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the war suddenly ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha killed the last angel and found that there was no opponent, and his knight was also seriously injured, ten knights, more than 50 Qi Qi's construction was dead, and the Knights of the Feng Feng only had four hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Silver Knight and the Templars, the square immediately appeared empty. There were corpses around the square and on the steps of the temple. There were not many bloodstains. The ground was full of black, which was the trace of the burning of the gods who were summoned by the Holy Scriptures. Richard looked up and looked at the main entrance of the temple. There were priests everywhere, and there were more than a dozen shrine knights. They were staring blankly at the object of their own death, and they were at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin took a holy hand in one hand, holding a white cloth in one hand, waving desperately, watching his pleasant expression and cheerful movements, how could Richard not? Linked him to the young cardinal who had just forced himself into desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped out of the unicorn, dragged the sacred kill, and walked to the door of the temple. Richard went to Martin and looked at the piece. Still in the white cloth waving cheerfully, frowning asked: "What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, the sign of the mainland, isn't it?" Martin replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled so brightly, even a little rejoicing, it seems that surrender is a very worthwhile thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Richard not happy at all: "But... surrender can be so happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin did not seem to understand Richard’s irony, saying: Of course, I can finally confirm the surrender. The soldiers on both sides do not have to sacrifice any more. Isn't this a happy thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Really." Richard found that he could not find anything to refute him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer cares about Martin, and turned back: "Senma, you take the people to occupy the temple, carefully search, Gangde, you go to the Earls Court, take over the city defense... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop saw that Richard was facing his own, and suddenly lifted his staff, and he went to the back of the brain, and the staff swung into the air, but suddenly Stopped, Richard held the staff with his left hand, and the sacred killing of his right hand had been placed on the neck of the bishop. Richard did not care about the bishop, but his eyes fell on Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stood in the same place, but he did not move, and he was too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and slowly recovered the sacred killing and said to the bishop: "You are very courageous."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have faith." The bishop replied slyly, not afraid that Richard could kill himself at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned back and said to several costume knights: "Look at them." Then he walked inside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Martin to somehow follow up and said to Richard: “Lie, adults, wait for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing, Richard glanced at Martin and looked at the knights and said, "You are not very simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; Richard said that the costume knight looked at the bishop and Martin, but they stared at the bishop who had lost power, but turned a blind eye to Martin, let him run to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and said: "There are some arrogant abilities. If you mention me in the Temple of the Holy Glory, you still have some fame."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and continued to walk deep into the shrine, looking at the historic sculptures and murals in the shrine, and asked, "What do you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
