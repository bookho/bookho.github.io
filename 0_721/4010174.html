It should have a young face, but there are more knife-like lines between the two eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi’s eyes flashed with complex light, and the hand touched Richard’s throat, suddenly making a knife with his hand, making everything light and whispering: “Cut You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no reaction at all, and sleeps like a dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 looked at him quietly, the look in his eyes gradually began to change, and began to murder. However, at this moment, she suddenly felt a very strong sense of danger, and she did not feel a glimpse. But if you want to find the source of this feeling, you can't find it. Qi Qi’s hand was always placed in Richard’s throat, and with a little capacity, he could crush Richard’s throat. But now, the action on her hand has not lost the original murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why am I doing this? Just for the grandfather who wants to sell me the highest price?" Qi Qi said to herself, with a self-deprecating smile on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not notice that the biggest one of the string of beasts on the wrist of Richard’s wrist had already had a dark red glow, but with her murder And changed back to an ordinary animal tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi’s eyes swept over Richard’s well-balanced body, and finally fell on the culprit who had just made her collapse. It is a wicked one, and until now it is still standing like a gun, it seems to show off its brilliant achievements. There was a faint red color on the face of Qi Qi, staring at the weapon, and biting his teeth and hating: "Cut you sooner or later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer replied in response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly got up and walked over Richard’s coat. As for her own long skirt, it has now completely turned into a piece of rag. When Qi Qi was dressed, she suddenly saw the piece of magic paper on the table. In her heart, she picked up the paper and looked at Richard's graffiti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several names on the paper, including Su Helun, Gordon, Elani, Liusha, and the mountains and the sea. Next to each name, there are many numbers and words. For example, Su Hailun, her name is written "four million a year", "the joy of Su Hailun", "the holy builder" and "let you wake up." And around Gotton, it is "Give you a more powerful Archimonde", "kill you sooner or later", and so on. And beside the mountains and the sea, there is only one sentence "to pick you up within five years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paper, there are many paintings in a simple and powerful way. Like, the look is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is helplessly floating in the void, the barbarian girl is fixed when the walk is far away, the moment of waving his hand, desolation, free and heavy. Looking at this picture, Qi Qi feels that every step of the girl's fall will make the earth tremble. Gordon is vague, that is a burning fire. Ilani does not exist, only a volcano, the highest point of the crater, growing an indescribable flower. There is also the sand, which is a back view of the sacred horse standing in front of the altar. In the void in the sky above her head, it still represents the time and space of the grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These paintings are extremely simple in brushwork, but each line contains a suffocating force! That is the complete outbreak of Richard's full emotion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Qi Qi suddenly understood, this piece of paper is Richard’s responsibility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit her lower lip and looked at Richard's eyes full of complexity. It’s her own, she doesn’t know what the mood is at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Qi Qi gnashed her teeth: "You pig!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried her best, Drag Richard to his bedroom. The room is next door, but in a few short walks, Qi Qi has a big sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day until noon, Richard woke up from the hangover. He didn't even know that he had been treated as a pig by someone last night. He only felt that his headache was like a crack at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too uncomfortable to have a good drink next time!" Richard looked at his forehead and thought. But he moved like this, but he felt that he was still sleeping alone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine of Licha suddenly disappeared, the body was quietly tightened, and a fatal blow could be made at any time, which opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, Qi Qi curled up like a kitten, holding one of his arms tightly, still sleeping. She is completely naked/body/lying, and from which angle the perfect body curve can make people hold their breath involuntarily. Although she has seen every part of her body, at this moment, Richard's heart still missed a few beats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard immediately remembered, how could it be her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened last night was completely blank. When Richard tried hard to think back, he took out some fragmented pictures from his memory. However, these pictures have shocked him. What happened to all the things that happened last night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that Qi Qi should not be under house arrest? How could she suddenly appear in the study? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the sleeping girl, Richard suddenly did not want to wake her up. He lay back in bed and began to work hard to think about what happened last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few minutes, the very sensitive Luo Qi felt the strangeness of Richard and woke up. When she opened her eyes, she saw that Richard was also looking at her at a distance. Her eyes are still clear and her eyes are soft and watery, but the block of cyanosis printed on the white skin shows how crazy the battle last night was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally saw her awake, her face was immediately covered with a layer of frost, and then slowly melted and turned flat. He looked at Qi Qi and asked, "How did you come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean house arrest? Yes, I convinced the old housekeeper, he thinks I didn't harm, so I released it so that I can move freely on the floating island, but I can't leave the floating island." Qi Qi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is a cold, faintly said: "The ability to convince people is not small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, people in the family like me very much now." Qi Qi said, don't forget to add a sentence: "Besides you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is not your family, your name is Mensa." Richard reminded her coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 is not angry at all, said faintly: "Blood is a very effective criterion, but not all. I heard that Ake There are also many people who have a surname but no glory. This has just been proved recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to prove?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you prove that the hundreds of people killed by the three knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;珞琪's counter-inquiry made Richard speechless. This is his rare in the word front, and Richard frowned, saying: "But the blood and surname are still the most important attribution!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My What the surname can give me is to force me to marry an ageing metamorphosis and sadism. So my whole meaning to Mensa is my face and future fertility. If I value this sense of belonging, then Shouldn't you be happy to marry the Duke of Peter Peter, and then die after a few years in his various tortures? Now, do you still think that the most important label on me is the name of Mensa?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is speechless again. He has to admit that Qi Qi is really able to convince others, including himself. In fact, the best way is to not let her speak. Richard's gaze passed over the block of the body of Qi Qi, and calmly asked: "That, what we seem to have done last night. You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi seems to know exactly what Richard thinks, and replied plainly: "I am the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so direct, but let Richard was a little confused, and he said, "I don't mean this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Qi Qi went one step further, propped up the upper body and then raised his left leg high Lifting up, revealing the most intimate part, with a calm and calm voice saying: "You can check, now it should be too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is wild The action, the peaceful expression, constitutes an irresistible stimulus. Richard has not had time to think too much, the body will respond first, and the human weapon will stand up again as a flag! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so angry and angry that he turned over and put Qi Qi underneath, ready to occupy her body again, and said softly: "That's good! I will Check once!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the checks that the two said were just words consistent, the way... in fact, it may be consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi closed her eyes and waited quietly. However, at the moment of close contact, although she was very patient, she couldn't help but wrinkle a little, and her hands grasped the sheets subconsciously. After a big battle last night, she was already scarred. Now that I haven't recovered, I have to be invaded again, making her hurt like a knife. How to calm down, her body's instinctive reaction can not be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at her faint expression, stopped further movements, rolled over and went out of bed, first licking the forehead of the pain, and then stretching a few Under the body, a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned and looked at Qi Qi, his complex complex, slowly said: "I know this thing, I will think again. This time You can stay at peace of mind first, I will let the butler give you a place to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 also got out of bed, but just took a step, it turned A change, the legs are wrong, almost fell. However, she stood up stubbornly and said to Richard: "My role is not just in bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Richard finished, quickly dressed When I got dressed, I left the room. When the door closed behind him, Richard was relieved. Everything happened so suddenly, he didn't have time to think about it. In this case, it is too much pressure to face a girl like Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
