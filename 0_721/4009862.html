			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody mark occupies a whole block, the mouth is vital The spring is hidden in his residential courtyard. This block has a pub and a casino, of which the casino is Mark's main source of income. But now, although it is prime time, there are few people in the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little thought about it, Richard judged it not because of the relationship with the event atnight, because the news would not spread so quickly. It seems that the casino was like this earlier, and it was because of the problem of income that Mark would send Sam to the bloodstone camp to collect the road tax. However, it is a strange thing that the business of the casino will be good with Mark’s character and way of doing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloodstone Camp is not too big, and Richard is running all the way, and in a few minutes he rushes to the Mark's nest on the other side of the camp. The mammoth squad almost alerted the people in the half-stone camp, but the speed of their assault was too fast, and the patrol's several half-orc warriors had not even had time to call a few times. Going far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the door of Marvin’s nest, the crowd rolled over and the two ogres also ran. With a slap in the face, Richard’s hand screamed at a three-pointer. The speed did not decrease and the speed increased. He rushed to the door. In the last few steps, he jumped up and slammed his hand on the door! A loud bang, the door completely separated from the door frame, flew out of the courtyard, fell to the ground, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has stood in front of the gate, and the broken pages of the books carried between his hands began to show. The next five fierce wolves rushed into the courtyard and began to attack fiercely. Everything in the field of vision. The exclamation and screams sounded at the same time, and the house immediately became a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack came so fast that the sentinel in the two corners of the courtyard began to probe at this time, and did not figure out what happened. However, the two arrows immediately cut through the darkness, nailed to the sentinel's throat, and sealed their ability to shout. And Richard stood at the gate and continued to recite the spell with ease. After a few seconds, five fierce wolves appeared in the courtyard, causing even greater confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a full ten violent wolves began to slam in the courtyard, Richard began to fire a fireball that could not be cooked again. And when he began to recite the spell, several of his own people showed some strange expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large range of magic is inherently an indiscriminate attack that does not distinguish between me and the enemy. Richard’s magical tactics are the most effective in this feature. This is not the first time. The fireball matrix formed by the delayed fireball covers all of the summoning creatures. Those who are not familiar with Richard are afraid that they will lose a lot under the fireball matrix. I have to say that this tactic is extremely sinister and hot, yet very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the position of Richard Fireball is in the door of Mark’s two-story building, the three fireballs are almost overlapping, when they are At the same time, the exclamation of the bloody mark became a tragedy! The fire wave swept the entire courtyard in an instant, and even a window on the second floor of the building had a fire tongue spurting out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man Sam stared at everything that happened in front of him, his body began to tremble, and finally he sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire wave went out, Richard only pointed to the hospital, so each of them fell into the courtyard like a wolf, and launched a one-sided slaughter. More than a dozen wind teeth were wrapped around the courtyard, and they jumped onto the wall one by one, giving the enemy a fatal blow from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the shouting sound gradually weakened, and Mark Kui’s figure appeared in the courtyard. Seeing Richard standing at the gate, his eyes shot the light of extreme hatred, screaming and waving his eyes to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already been in the blood, and the footsteps of the assault are also embarrassing, only to take two steps, the body flashed a deep yellow magic light. It turned out that Tiramisu threw a slow delay on him, which caused Mark's speed to drop by a third. Then several weapons broke into the mark, and the guide of the eternal sleep even penetrated his chest directly from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of death, Mark did not know where it came from, and screamed, and actually took a few big steps forward. However, at this time a sacred flame descended from the sky and fell on Mark. He immediately screamed with extreme pain. Then he slanted and slanted a few steps without any direction. He finally could not support it and fell to the ground. The heavy body still slipped forward for a while, and it stopped, just stopping at Richard's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snow white scarf fell freely, covering Mark's head, and then Richard's boots stepped on the square scarf and grinded a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands just came out of the courtyard and saw this scene, whispering in the ear of Richard: "There are no enemies now, don't need this..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the action was stagnation, and then quietly, quietly reached for a hand on her buttocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is silent, faintly said: "There are all people present, and it is not necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He had already breathed a little more smoothly, and was immediately blocked by a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over, and the raging fire quickly swallowed the two-story building where Mark originally lived. In the fire, Oral took a big box and squatted. More than ten pockets of big and small came out. The elf poet is extremely sensitive to the sense of wealth, and the treasure house of the old aristocratic family can not escape his nose, let alone the guy with a muscle in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went to Richard, Oral handed the box to the ogre, then kicked Mark and said, "This is a poor ghost. Everything is worth three hundred gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many more live?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde shrugged and replied: "They are all guys who are running faster than rabbits when they see it badly! So now the yard is dead. It’s that you can’t run away if you are seriously injured. You don’t want to catch the captives, head.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Gangde’s mind, Richard realized this problem. Now that you have reached the blood-stained land, you don't need to grab the captives to expand the army. Gold coins or slaves are a good way to get a quick success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Well, bring him, we should go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The crowd turned over, the bloody Mark's body was also thrown onto the horse, and then no hurry to walk back to the hotel. There was a heavy and messy footstep in the darkness of the distance, and then a group of half-orc warriors rushed out from the corner, stopping Richard's return. This is the warrior of the Bloodstone tribe, and it is also the core force for maintaining the order of the bloodstone camp. They actually came very fast, but they just barely blocked Richard's return. The things that Richard wanted to do had already been done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
