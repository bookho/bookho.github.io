			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black shadow at the end of the sky, and then quickly zoomed in. This is a common iron feather vulture in the blood-stained area. It has fifteen-level strength and is one of the most famous murderous birds in the blood-stained area. It found the giant worms and bats that were flying in the air, and immediately thought it was a rare food, so they screamed and screamed and flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of fighting bats is large, but they are only eight, not the opponent of this fifteen-level vulture. The two sides battled into a group at once, and the fangs of the fighting bat could not grasp the hard, iron-like feathers of the vultures, but the vultures were one by one, directly swallowing a bat. That is, all the bats are eaten, but they can fill the belly of the giant bird that is five meters long. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the occasion of the fierce flame of the iron feather vulture, dozens of compound eyes on the head and back of the giant hover that have been hovering in the air suddenly light up, and then He uttered a short high-pitched scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This screams like a cone like a chisel, smashing on the soul of the iron feather vulture, instantly let the giant bird lose consciousness, one from the air Planted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a muffled sound, the iron feather vulture deep into the ground. Under the violent impact, it recovered its mind, but it was still dizzy, but it slammed its wings and could not fly. Giant insect swooped down from the sky, aligned vulture head again soon Psychic Scream, she again lost consciousness. Then the giant insect flew Ironfeather vultures who, by conquering what mouthparts to bite open a giant bird's skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously sending out two psychic screams is already the limit of the giant worm. It appears to be weak and hungry, and can’t wait to devour the body of the iron-bearing vulture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant worm is not known for its fighting. It is almost occupied by the brain in its huge chest. And it has a strong soul force can be long-distance communication and the hive, as a transit point, the mother will be passed to the nest fighting unit out of distance. In special cases even nest in command instead of the mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sequence of the mother nest, it is called the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this battle, the aristocrats around the blood-stained land were once again deeply shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer whale is the most powerful slave group in the blood-stained area, and the supporter is the Duke of Feslik of the Iron Triangle Empire. When their bodies were also erected at the stake next to the tax collection points, and that were also stripped sanctuary, there is no decency and dignity to be worn at the stake, all the groups really capture slaves I feel scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Faro, the protests and denunciations of the nobility were sent to Oasis as snow flakes and piled up on Richard’s desk. A tall stack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha first let the sand to rest, he sat at his desk, took the top of the paper and took it apart, seeing it inside The content is alleging that Gangde unreasonably attacked their slave team in the blood-stained land and killed the snatching fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libun wanted to throw away these things at hand, but suddenly he moved, put them down, and then gently tapped the desk And weighed this matter repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Richard finally decided to call Gangde and ask questions carefully. Although Richard is absolutely trusting in Gangde, it is so important to know at least the cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making this decision, Richard did not realize that his thoughts were changing quietly, and he had taken a small step toward the real superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde has already returned to Oasis City, and the sweeping of the Slaughter Group has reached its goal. Now all the squadrons have renounced the cavalry, and they have honestly given up their resistance. Most of them have already recorded the tax. If they don’t pay, they will double the tax, and the patrol cavalry will not bother them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the occasional lucky slaves who successfully evade taxes, there will be such a thing, there is no need to be serious. If there is a big blood-staining place, there will always be a fish that slips through the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sensed the position of Gangde, left the study and walked toward the military camp. As soon as the door of Gangde was approaching, Richard unexpectedly heard the thunder inside. When Richard stood at the door, he saw that seven or eight people were sitting around the table and drinking. Inside are the generals in the army of Richard, the two fallen gods of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, Kas and Marvin, with Him and several nobles. The most unexpected thing for Richard is that the fighting sergeant Io is actually there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle priest is still the most handsome one, but it is no longer the same as in the past. At this moment, he was holding Him's neck with one hand, and fiercely poured into the mouth of the unicorn Viscount. Look at him like this, full ten is a drunkard, and there is still a half-point battle goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him bitterly swallowed the mouthful of spirits, but after a while he forgot the lesson and found the Italian-Russian wine. As a result, the three cups went down, and Iowo still sat straight, and the unicorn visor shook and slowly slipped into the bottom of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russ is sitting upright and straight, his eyes shining. He suddenly saw Richard standing quietly at the door, his eyes flashing fiercely, patted the table hard and shouted: "Licha! Come over, drink! I don't believe this can't kill you!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneer, is preparing to fight, but sees that the expressions and movements of Iow have become stiff, and then slowly lie back, a bang with a chair On the floor, this person is not saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang’s mouth was open, but he couldn’t say anything, but he just shook his head helplessly. I will once again clean up the plan of Iowa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the room of Gangde, but Richard did not see Gangde on the wine table. However, the positioning in consciousness, Gangde is clearly in this room. At this time, a burly figure suddenly emerged from under the table, it was Gangde. He looked at Richard seriously, and waved his hand in a serious manner and said, "Hey! You are back! Just drink together! See how I clean up these guys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde finished the sentence and disappeared under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Gangde appeared again, he glanced at the audience in a mighty manner, seeing everyone swaying, could not help but wave a hand, said with pride: "Head! Look, these guys are not my opponents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, Gangde disappears again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was completely speechless, which is the first time that Gangde swept the other side, clearly that he was the first to be swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde appeared for the third time, this time his eyes stared blankly at the front, roaring: "Shuihua! Have the ability to fight again! Fight me though You can't beat you, but you are not my opponent when you drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
