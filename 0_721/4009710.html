According to the rules of dark blue, I have every reason to ask you to pay back the money immediately. If you still can't, then just follow me, work to pay the debt, or get out of the dark blue!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the man turned to Richard, he had already put on a smiley face, and the speed of changing his face was faster than the instant magic: "Honor, Lord Richard, maybe we should not be here. But we are all doing things in accordance with the rules of dark blue, and we dare not violate the rules. The great Su Hailun once said that the contract is not tolerated. And this woman is not owed, and refuses to pay interest or provide services according to the rules. You should not be blinded by her pity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attitude is very respectful, but the words also imply toughness. The rules of dark blue are not strictly speaking, but they are as tough as steel. Even the big magisters are not qualified to violate, and Richard does not have this qualification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked frowning and looked back at Eileen. The girl’s eyes clearly had cringe and fear. And her eyes did not dare to touch Richard positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee five fingers gather, the magic fireball that jumps floats a few meters, and then slams and smashes. Such a subtle magical control made the three men's faces change, and they couldn't help but retreat a few steps. It makes sense to be reasonable, but the status of the two sides is too disparate, and of course they are still afraid. If Richard is in a bad mood and hurts them, the only trouble is the compensation for gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at them and said, "She owes your account, I will pay for her. Now give me a roll!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The man headed by him was obviously unwilling, and he was still staring at Irene, who was hiding behind Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered a little and said, "Why, are you going to question my credibility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The three men's faces immediately turned white, and they said nothing. But the headed man suddenly stared at Irene and said, "Small things, you give me a wait, it is best not to go home alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard's face sank, and the three men immediately stepped up and rushed all the way. Until their backs disappeared, Richard turned back and looked at Irene, who embraced her arms and bowed her head. She sighed and asked, "How much do you owe them?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One...one thousand two hundred gold coins." Irene's voice was very light, obviously a little trembling, and her shoulders were quietly swaying, apparently crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sighing and sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that the last time Irene was still willing to earn his money, but now it’s been less than a year. If it is not a no-brainer, perhaps Irene will not tell him the amount of debt. Saying the number means that she is ready to accept Richard's funding. Within a year, purity, self-respect and pride have gone away from her. The girl who came in from the door of the bathroom in the past had a good sun-like taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart is inadvertently tightened, some because the man’s saying “You don’t make money from men”, The more is because the number of debts that forced her to go so far, only one thousand and two hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand two hundred gold coins, but it was the time when he experimented with two magical powers and drank two bottles of recovery medicine. It was still a year ago, and now Richard has not used ordinary magic to restore the remedy. The effect is too bad and it takes too slow. When he got the bill at the beginning of each month, he didn't even look at the last four digits at all, because whether it was four zeros or four nines, it was just a meaningless fraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very calm, and he couldn’t see any emotional fluctuations from his face. He just asked indifferently: "I will pay for this money for you." Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene hesitated for a moment and whispered: "I still owe a few other people four hundred gold coins, but I can find my own way... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He interrupted her: "A total of 1,600 gold coins, no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Irene finally looked up, and before that, hurriedly rubbed her face on her face. She glanced at Richard and finally smiled helplessly, and reached out and gathered her hair. Now her emotions have completely calmed down. The faint smile seems to have a shadow of the original sunny girl: "But I have no ability." Earn this money, you can't pay you back for at least half a year. I have nothing, only myself. So if you want me, you can come to me at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Richard does not seem to hear what she is saying, but take out a note, write the payment credentials on it, sign his name, stuff it into Irene, and then see you again. Did not say a word, they strode to their own residential area. A few steps away, Richard suddenly turned back, the girl did not leave, but clasped her hands tightly, kneeling in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart sighed again and re-entered the girl. Irene raised her head and looked up at Richard, whispering, "I... I am scared. Sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of those men?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene silently nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out to the girl and said, "Let's go, I will send you back. I will see, who dares to stop you on the road." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Richard, there has been a faint murderousness. In the case that he has promised to pay for Eileen, if those people dare to entangle themselves, then Richard does not mind giving them a deep lesson, even sending a few people to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of the deep blue main tower and the fringe area are completely two classes with huge differences in rights. If Richard kills someone in the fringe area, he only needs to lose money. In the case of the other party's malicious provocation or insult to him, Richard has no responsibility at all, and even loses money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene took Richard’s hand and took the opportunity to stand up. Then she immediately retracted her hand and walked a little behind Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the main tower to the fringe area is a long and quiet road. The night was already deep. There were not many pedestrians on the road. A few people hurried past, and they did not look at Richard and Irene. They have exhausted their physical strength during the busy day, and now they are only looking forward to going back early, sleeping warmly, and waiting for a whole day tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the way, Richard and Irene remained silent and did not say anything. Neither of them knew what to say. In the past year, they have reached a point where they are speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an alley on the periphery of the fringe area, Irene's residence is a closed room that does not see the dark blue outside. The windows are still there, just more like a display, the windows can only be opened to the inside of the room, and the outside of the slap is the wall of the patio, the magic light is the only source of illumination. Similar houses are found everywhere in the fringe, while rooms with exterior windows are three to four times more expensive. Although surrounded by dark blue, there are scattered small towns, but outsiders prefer to live in the dark blue, even if it is a black house in the fringe area, it is more decent than the residents in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene was sent to the door, and after secretly remembering the address, Richard turned and left, deliberately did not go to see Irene with the look of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the sky is still cold, the edge of the night is very quiet, the lights are dim, the inferior polymer fuel is quite unstable, the light flickers, sways, pulls out Large shadows, like a monster with a headed ectopic face, crawling and crawling at any time may prey on prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Richard suddenly felt a little cold. It is already near the outermost edge of the edge zone, and the temperature is only minus ten degrees. However, Richard's magic robe is naturally different from ordinary magicians, and it can be resisted by minus 50 degrees. But now Richard feels a bit cold and cold and unnatural. It is a kind of cold, cold and cold, as if it is in an ice cave that has not melted for thousands of years. Even the air is solidified, and it seems to fall into the reptile's cellar. From time to time, something is snaked from the back. Over. Soon, Richard had a thin sweat and drenched his clothes, which was particularly uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out a sigh of relief and loosened the button at the neckline of the magic robe. When the fingertip inadvertently touched the badge of the neckline, it was suddenly burned! The badge doesn’t know when it’s starting to shine, and it’s hot. This badge is unique to Su Hailun's students, not only a symbol of status, but also a magic to detect hostility. And it has become so hot, indicating that the enemy is already near, and does not hide the intention! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly froze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the side of Richard's side, a shadow began to bulge, and then a humanoid creature emerged from it. It cuts the shadow like a torn suede, and then saves it like a cheetah, and a dark gray short sword in his hand has stabbed Richard's back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sniper is hot and swift, and it is suddenly launched at close range. It is difficult to resist the training of the soldiers who are being attacked, not to mention that they are still not Adult magic apprentice? The killer and the bower are the nemesis of the magician, but one is close and the other is remote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dagger sword tip touched the magic robe, it was unexpectedly missed and failed to pierce the robe! The reaction of the killer is also good, not flustered, the sword tip does not see any skew, condense a little, afterburner and then stab. The magic robe immediately glowed with a faint khaki glow, then swelled, and another translucent shield was triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer immediately felt his arm and the weapon, such as into the thick mud, and it was very difficult to wave. But the killer is not the first to assassinate the magician, and has more experience in dealing with magic shields. So he was still at the point where the sword tip was set, suddenly bursting out of strength, the short sword stabbed like a cone chisel, and slammed, and already opened a big hole in the magic robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the magic robe is empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer arm waved and took the magic robe to the side and saw that Richard had taken the opportunity to run a few meters and ran towards a shadowed alleyway. . The killer immediately burst into darkness, because there was already another partner in the alley in the ambush, and Richard was looking for a dead end! However, in the hands of the prey, the credit is different. The killer immediately accelerated, and the upper body leaned forward almost parallel to the ground, catching up at a speed that was more than double that of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
