Sitting on such a force is not much different from mastering the two legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the cause of this war, God Mu Wujin is also on the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin promised to return the strategic stock of the Cardinal Mission to Richard after returning. As for the group of gods Wujin who had been robbed, they needed Richard himself has found a way, and if he can get back, it is an extra harvest. If he doesn't come back, there is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the split, it is time to break up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin and Richard are standing on the platform of the Holy Light, standing opposite, St. Martin has never removed his light platform, and Richard has not removed Medalun battle version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Martin can’t see Richard’s expression, he can only see a cold metal mask. Of course, if Richard wants to have an expression, he can Shown through the mask, but now, Richard does not want to have any expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or St. Martin’s first opening: “Lee, I remember that the structure on your body is all things, it’s a set of four-stage suits, it’s like There is also the holy structure as an integral part, but now you have this piece of body, the battle posture of Midalun, I am very curious, what is your carrying capacity, nothing else, just this set of Midalun You can suck the general legend into a corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Martin shrugged: "That is of course, I always know something about the armed forces of the heavens. After Michael was made, in order to use him, the church has sacrificed more than a dozen samurai warriors, and even one The legendary paladin was sucked into a corpse by Michael. After paying such a heavy price, Michael became the special heavenly arm of the heavenly people. It was the most bloody person in the royal family. Try Michael again, and you can even suppress Michael in this battle posture, don’t tell me what it is. Michael is even lower, I do not believe the world will be a free lunch "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Richard smiled and said, "Would you like to put it on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolutely, keep yourself, I want to live more. In a few years, the main service.” St. Martin seems to be a viper for this set of Midarene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are not interested, don't ask so much, well, if nothing else, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand to Martin and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he outlined the portal, Martin said: "The war is over, why don't you take this armor off?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not return, and continued to outline his portal: "If I take it off now, then the war may start again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie smiled and said, "How come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our friendship is very fragile and cannot stand the test." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal was finally completed, and Richard stepped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stretched his neck and shouted at the portal: "Lee, you can tell me why there is such a high carrying capacity, otherwise." I will be tortured by my own curiosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is heard from the portal that will disappear: "I am strong." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stunned, after a long time, he came back and angered: "Strong, strong, you can still be stronger than the orcs."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he recalled the relaxed and freehand brushwork of Richard’s flying saints, and his conviction suddenly shook. It seems that Richard is stronger than the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin slowly turned around, there are hundreds of thousands of troops below, there are hundreds of holy warriors in the sky, these, from today, it is his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Departure, we go back to the Great Temple of St. Hui." St. Martin's voice echoed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it is the only voice of the Guangming Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is over, but for some people, bad luck is just beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being released by Richard, Stevenson and Minnie went all the way to the Duke of Soram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road was very far away, so at night, Stevenson chose a small town and took Minnie into a small hotel. He did not reveal his identity. For him, the current situation is an unbearable shame, how can he reveal his identity, in that case, he will only become a laughing stock in the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire 100,000-strong army, so military, the result was so easily collapsed under Richard’s raid, and the horrific power that Richard revealed when he descended from the sky, Not only the generals were shocked, but even Devenson was afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, he regretted it more than once, why didn’t he have the courage to rush to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson knows that he can never be Richard’s opponent, but a strong opponent is not a reason to avoid the war, even if the heroic battle is dead, now The state is much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson knows that the fear of Richard has now penetrated deep into his soul. He even lost his fighting spirit because he knows, no matter what. Efforts are not likely to catch up with Richard. The gap between the two sides has reached a point of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hotel, Stevenson threw his tired body directly into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was very simple, not even as good as his servant's room, but now he didn't think about it, but how to tell the Duke of Soram after he went back. There are dozens of nobles and generals, and tens of thousands of warriors need to redeem them. The amount of ransom is so large that he does not even dare to calculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini sat in the corner, did not say a word, did not know what to think about, since she was released, she did not say a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson suddenly sat up, staring at Minnie, and said coldly: "You are not feeling right now, thinking about what."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie barely squeezed a smile and said, "I didn't think about anything, I was just tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A loud slap in the face, so that her whole person flew backwards, and the back of the head slammed on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini screamed, rolled a few laps, barely propped up her body, her clear face was swollen quickly, and blood oozes from the hairline. Flow down the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson shouted like crazy: "You are a son/son, don't think I don't know what you are thinking, you are thinking about Richard, I wondered why I didn’t go to his bed at the beginning, but I got on my bed. That’s it. You said, yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini One laugh, bitterly, said: "How come, I only have you in my heart, don't you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson suddenly smiled I laughed a bit madly: "I certainly know that I know that I am nothing like Richard. The composition is better than him. Su Hailun also likes him more. Now he is already a legend. It is already His Royal Highness, and I, I am again. What counts, even on the battlefield, I brought 100,000 people, a whole 100,000 people, but they were beaten by more than half of Archimonde. You have me in my heart, and I have such a waste. In your heart, beautiful Miss Minnie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly grabbed Minnie’s collar, lifted her up and stared at her The eyes said, "Do not think that I didn't know. When I left Deep Blue, you secretly went to look for Richard. It was just that people couldn't look at your stock, and you had to follow me back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini took a sigh of relief and said, "How do you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you were bombarded by Richard, I was watching at the end of the passage." The voice of Stevenson suddenly became normal, the tone was low, and even a little gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it’s a slap in the face, Blood is found in the nose and nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explain, well, you explain it to me, explain it, explain it." Every time Sidvinson swears, he will slap a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cymbals kept ringing, and the blood was splashed on the wall, which was shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door was lightly ringed, and the hotel’s maid said outside the door: "Adult, you have nothing to do, some guests say it is too noisy, I can't sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson strode to the door and opened the door. The maid saw his completely distorted face and was scared. It was a scream on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson grabbed a full amount of gold coins and slammed his head to the maid, saying coldly: "The money you take, if there is Which stupid goods are too long to live, and if I feel too noisy, you will come directly to me, I will break the bones of these people one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the long corridor, there were a few guests who looked out with anger and anger, but with the eyes of Stevenson, and then saw the splendid gold coins scattered in the ground, they immediately shook back. Close the door. Br 砰 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Because of the dull voice in the room, she heard her heart crack, as if every bone was hurting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Stevenson kicked his face on Minnie’s face, and there was another blood on the wall, and he was still wearing a tooth and saw These, he felt a little breath and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini was on the ground, the body twitched involuntarily, and the strength of the shackles was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her embarrassing curve, Stevenson suddenly felt his throat dry, and the lower body began to swell rapidly and he was swollen. He slammed into Minnie and directly tore her. Under the body / body of clothing, exhausted all strength, and then inserted into the deepest part of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Stevenson is like a tramp who has never touched a woman, exhausted the power of breastfeeding, and madly hits Minnie, every If you collide, you will scream: "Silly, oh, goods, is my guy big or Richard's big, say, you are a stock, you don't just want to be Richard."
