Inserted to the side of the ground, and sat down on the throne, restored the look of indecent and lazy, the momentum slowly converged, after a while, he and the peak gradually disappeared, and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the peak is not disappearing, it has always been there, but now it has no extraordinary atmosphere, in the eyes of the strong people who are used to perceiving the touch of the world, It is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change suddenly came, no face and a bow, she looked at the peak, and looked at the opponent in front of the fierce and fierce, suddenly double sword One close, jumped out of the battle circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the big axe is also a glimpse, Shen Sheng: "Do not fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Licha is gone, what is still playing." No face said, the sword has been returned to the sheath, and then turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant axe warrior looked at the faceless face and asked, "Where are you going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just find a place to sleep, and then wait for Richard to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant axe warrior snorted and said, "What is the use of his return." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face, no stop, no turning back, just waved and left a sentence, "That can be difficult to say." Then he went away and disappeared. The bloody battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Richard finally opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a blur in front of me, and the thinking is dull and terrible, there will always be strange ideas coming out, and the eyes are constantly shaking through various kinds of sè Piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with me." Hard, Richard succeeded in condensing a clear idea in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that it was wrong, Richard immediately began to try to concentrate, but this was a breeze when he was a child, but this moment is particularly difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts are like a naughty child. I will jump here to see it, and I will rush there to touch it, but I don’t want Richard to catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept trying and working hard, and finally grasped the idea of ​​jumping, and then had a clear idea: "I have to regain control of my body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard began to try to move, and finally finally got in touch with various parts of the body, but the result of the trial activity was very close to that of Richard. Not the same, he wants to raise his left hand, but the move is the left leg, he wants to flank his head, but his hand is lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that his feelings and the actual movements were greatly deviated. He could only continue to try. Finally, in an attempt to sit up, his eyes had The focal length and vision have finally become clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a dark gray sky, like the most yīn sun, and near dusk, but the gray in the sky is not a cloud, it is A smoky ash, in the corner of the field of vision, and a twisted branch, trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is like a crazy dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should use real talent." Another idea came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard’s vision changed. In addition to the normal scene, he also saw a group of twisted and changed rules. After the real talents were mobilized, Richard's thinking became quicker and clearer, and some distorted images disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the rules line in the air while trying to resolve and trying to remember what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analytical rules are only the actions of Richard Instinct. When I come to a strange world, the first thing that Richard often does is to understand and even analyze the rules here. To understand a world, there is no better way than parsing its rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard began to analyze the rules, the speed of thinking suddenly increased a lot, and gradually improved, so he began to try to think about what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that when the completely unrivalled sword blew, suddenly there was a lot of time to emerge, and then pulled himself into the time channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God sent." Richard called out and suddenly sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered, at the moment of dying, the god of grace from the Eternal and Time Dragon sent himself to start and sent him to this strange world. It was the same as saving his life, so Richard knew where he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the darkness of the eternal and timeless dragons that have never been seen, and have historically ruined the dark areas of countless gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and found himself sitting on a vast expanse of wilderness. This wilderness was extremely barren, without sunshine, without water, and without life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the endless wilderness, you can only see a few trees that don’t know how long they have died, and these trees are strangely strange, and the branches are stretched in all directions. Distorted, people look at it, there is actually a feeling that these big trees have gone crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was calm down and began to recall the details of the transmission of God's grace. He suddenly smiled. He finally remembered that God sent: Dark areas can also be specified. , not really random transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the sacrifice, Richard also upgraded the function of the designated place to go to the dawn, the problem lies in the use of God's transfer skills, because this skill has Multi-destination directional transfer function, so according to the instructions, you must first select the direction and then start the transfer to reach the specified area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard was ruined, he was sent to the dark area by his own self-starting grace, so he now does not know that the designated function is It does not play a role at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, there is a ridiculous ridiculousness everywhere, and even if Richard doesn’t even think about it, he knows that he can’t find anything to ask for directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to stand up, his movements and perceptions were still out of touch, and his thoughts were constantly jumping around, and after a while, Richard felt Dizziness, fell to the ground again, this feeling is right, so I can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha vaguely remembered that he seemed to have seen information about the dark areas, so he tried to think back and finally remembered reading a travel in a dark area. Something seems to come from St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The travel notes mentioned that the first thing after entering the dark area is to first establish a set of coordinate system, anchoring standards for time and space, to deal with the chaotic rule power here, with coordinates. Ability to restore normal perception and mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of the title of space lord, Richard’s accomplishments in space have reached the peak of Noland’s, once there is a goal, Richard’s The talent of wisdom began to show its power, and after a while, a set of coordinate system was established, and the ability to act was restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in terms of time, when Richard faced the terrible sword, he finally realized on the edge of life and death, now even if everything is chaotic In the dark areas, Richard was able to reconstruct a stable perception of the time flow and establish a time anchor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard finally feels that he is normal, can move normally, can think normally, and he first discovered that it was normal to be so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and checked his physical condition. He found that the body’s magic was so few that he was shocked. He sank and checked. Once again, this time I found a very serious injury in the body, almost all the internal organs were smashed, he was able to stand up, or because the body is strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered that when the transmission of God’s grace had not been fully completed, the man’s sword had passed the portal and the result was not completely closed. The portal was smashed, and Yu Li bombed Richard and wounded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard’s face sinks down, he still can’t figure out why there is such a powerful life in this world, in contrast, it is the demon god Kara is also like a little reptile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha temporarily put down this problem, and checked the contents of his body, the knife is still there, the fate crystal plate is also lying quietly in the pocket, but other equipment It has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking the equipment, it is imperative to restore the magic. Richard sat down and meditated. As a result, he opened his eyes in a few minutes and sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no starburst in the darkness, and there is no other energy that can be used for capture. After a few minutes of meditation, Richard has almost nothing to gain. It seems that in the dark areas, how to add magic has indeed become a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Siye again. His sights were all wilderness. He couldn’t see any life or special things. It’s a dead world, not only without life, but also lacking energy. Living in this world must be like Treat your own magic or strength like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and walked to the nearest big tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tall tree ten meters high, the end of the twisted twig is as sharp as the tip of the gun, and Richard touches the tree and finds it The big tree is not metal like the surface, but it is not wood, but completely petrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking the tree for a while, Richard found nothing, then he recalled that the efforts of "The Dark Areas Travel" finally saw results and thought of a piece of content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha randomly chose a direction and went on. In the travel notes, the second thing after going to the dark area is to walk, when moving, Being able to observe changes in the rules and thus control the rules here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked all the way and did find that the surrounding rules are constantly changing, but this change is not a chaotic rule like a foreign domain, in a dark area. The rules are only distorted, the rules of distortion are rules, and they can be parsed and controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Richard has been walking and does not know how long it has gone, but in this way, Richard’s control over the rules is rapidly increasing, very Fast, Richard didn't feel any discomfort anymore. Here, he already has a minimum ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on the distant horizon, the outlines of some buildings suddenly appeared. When Li’s eyes lit up, he walked there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a small town, the whole town is covered with a light black sè, it seems to be protected, vaguely visible inside The shadowed figure is moving around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching the town, Richard slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark areas are not completely untouched, there is even wisdom life here, and the towns in front are obviously from their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
