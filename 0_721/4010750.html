			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing about the situation, Richard thought about it and sent a 黯The front knight crossed the portal and went to the other side of the dragon to inquire about the situation. Then, every two hours, he sent a squadron rider through the portal. After a whole day, there was no squadron. Can come back from the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not in a hurry, while arranging the public team to attack the Principality of the bead chain, while continuing to study the invisibility of Chatterley, from the level of rule power, Cha Ta Lai's ability is not worth mentioning, but it is quite practical. The ability to study this ability does not take much time, but it can greatly improve the survival and actual combat power of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days passed, there is still no squadron knight coming back from the portal, and then at noon on the third day, Richard suddenly put the previous Zonghu, now Shura called and let him enter the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time only half an hour later, Zonghu laughed and walked out of the portal. He came to Richard’s Magic Lab and put it there. A special-shaped weapon was released on the ground and smiled. "There are a lot of dragons and there are three dragons on the other side. This time, it can be considered a fun."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Zong Hu kicked a foot on the weapon that was like a living thing on the ground and said, "This guy is full of dragon blood, and almost half of the blood of the dragon has entered this. The guy's belly, let it sleep for a month, it is estimated that it can be promoted, and at least it must be a legendary to wake up to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glanced at Zong Hu, frowned and walked over to him, tearing open the piece of clothing that had nothing to lose and wrinkles, revealing a slender body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu was originally as beautiful as a woman, and the skin is far better than the general beauty, but at the moment it is on his body, but it is full of wounds that fail to heal. The wound surface of each road is at least two fingers wide, and several places traverse the entire shoulder and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two rows of small and dense wounds at the waist ribs, so I don’t know what is the scar left after biting, in the body of Zonghu, these scars At the moment, as new, it shows that the injury is extremely serious. At that time, the situation was not as easy as he said, and it was a lot of luck to come back alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard frowned. "I didn't let you figure out the situation in the past. Come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can still say that you want to beat them a surprise. "Zong Hu said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am letting you attack, not to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, at the beginning It’s really a sneak attack, but it’s hard to beat.” Zonghu said with a smile, then kicked a different-shaped weapon on the floor and said, “It’s not easy to find a chance to feed this guy. It’s hard to meet, how can I easily miss it, and it’s much easier to get this guy out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie looked at Zonghu and suddenly sighed. Tooth, said: "I know that you have merged with Shura in the Big Three of the Brood, thus getting rid of the fate of the Son of God, and after you die, the Brood can also recreate a Shura based on the backed up information. However, the next time it is made is pure Shura, not the Zonghu, you understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu is still a careless expression Said: "There is no difference. The next Shura also has my soul. My memory is not the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Shura, not Zonghu." Richard once again stressed that it was extremely serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Zonghu put away the joke expression, silently, saying: "Zonghu or Shura, are not all the same."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at Zonghu and said: "Zonghu is a partner who fought with me in Faro, and Shura is only a combat unit made by the mother's nest, for the Zonghu. I can sacrifice some benefits, but for Shura, I won't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu suddenly felt that some could not bear the attention of Richard, and could not help but look at the corner Said: "But that is not worth it. I am a descendant of the gods. I am born guilty and not worthy of doing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha waved and interrupted In his words, he said, "Okay, don't let me repeat too many times. Now I will go to the wound immediately. If I am late, I can only see Shura."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Master." Zong Hu brought up the weapon that was like a living thing, and suddenly gave a gift to Richard before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and shook his head, feeling a little tired. His followers were indeed capable of tyrannical, even chasing the thirteen knights of Gotton, but they were equally individual and must not treat them like ordinary people, and Many of the followers are closely following when Richard has just set foot on the plane. The feelings are naturally different. Richard does not want them to have any damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness, Richard gave another commander to the portal and entered the portal, and then walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floor of this room, there is a stone shining with silver light, this silver stone is another evil soldier of Richard’s abhorrence, it After consuming the sword of silver, it became the current form, and there was no response. Fortunately, Richard could see through the insight that he still slowly evolved in the stone body, and he would not worry too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha habitually put his hand on the silver stone, perceive the internal changes, and this time, Richard’s perception actually appeared a long time The sickle, just in the slap of Richard's work, the silver stone suddenly split, the broken stone pieces fell, and it was revealed that there was a sharp blade on the edge of the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp blade in the room, and the sound of the beasts of the behemoths was loud, dull, deep, and the desolation of the desolation disappeared as if it had returned to wisdom. The long time of life has fallen, and then, this long knife has jumped a bit, and then slowly converged a long murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slowly reached out and held the handle. The knife violently leaped again and struggled a few times, but could not break away from Richard. The hand, this gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart is secretly surprised. The vibration of the long knife has actually exploded. If Licha has 20 strengths, he will immediately launch the magic. Armed with armed forces, and many years of painstakingly fighting God's official fighting techniques, fighting skills have reached the realm of masters, just this time will most likely be removed by a long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that at least a legendary level of power can control this fierce blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will put the long knife in front of him and examine it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This murderous blade retains the hateful marking ability of the abhorratory slaughter, and has the effect of enhancing damage to the most sorrowful object in Richard’s heart, and at the same time, its sharpness Raised a level to reach the legendary level, although it is not as sharp as the moonlight, but it is also equivalent to those legendary weapons known as Fengrui, and finally, a ability to let Richard also have some disappointment Surfaced:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destiny ruling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ability equivalent to a tag class. Richard can initiate a fate ruling on a target, then add a ruling mark to the other party, and a ruling mark in the body. The people are equivalent to being excluded by the rules of the world. The various defensive powers will be greatly weakened, even like nothing, and they will be attached with many susceptibility effects. In short, even a strong presence will become extremely fragile. The power of the rules itself, the more you know about the ability of the target, the more rules the rules of the battlefield environment control, the more obvious the effect of the fate ruling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate ruling needs to use the power of the rules, and the consumption is quite huge. Richard calculated that every time you use a fate ruling, you need to consume at least the equivalent The magic of two levels of magic, or the consumption of spiritual power as part of the power of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This counts, at present, the strength of Richard’s strength is up to three fate rulings in one day, but this ability, don’t say three times, even if it is enough once, and Richard's resolution of the rules is quite fast. As he becomes more sophisticated in the rules of control, the power of fate rulings will increase accordingly. From this point of view, this is simply an ability with endless potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that this fierce blade is called abhorry, it is no longer suitable. Richard has indulged and decided to change his name to the ruling according to his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a new ruling, Richard looked at it and decided to change his strategic deployment over the past few days. He hurriedly left the room and went straight to the plane portal. Go, call the squadron knight who just stepped into the portal on time, and then walked into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of entering the portal, Richard’s eyes are all familiar and radiant, and nothing can be seen at any time. This is the scene of the torrent of time, dazzling There is nothing in the light. Perhaps the birth and death of a plane is one of them, but the human eye is completely unable to capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plane of the plane, the human perception is completely confusing. It feels only after a moment. In fact, it may be a few days, or it may be perceived. Infinitely long, but only a normal step, and then fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard is no longer the juvenile mage of the year, and now he, every time the plane shuttle has been able to faintly perceive the turbulent out of the channel. The power of time, the more at this moment, the more the Richard is full of awe of the eternal and the dragon of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
