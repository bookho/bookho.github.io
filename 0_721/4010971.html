			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the indefinitely and said, "Hold me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Hesitated for a moment, came to Richard and held his arms around his neck. But Richard reached out and slammed her on her buttocks. She gritted her teeth, raised her legs, and slid it at Richard's waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and forth, and he curled up. Then he appeared three faces in his body. The three faces were ordered, chaotic and neutral. Power to recite the mantra spell: "Guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rules guard, and Richard and the indeterminate are firmly protected. Immediately, Richard floated up and put in the transfer point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, on the other side of the distance, Richard and undecided to fly out of the transfer point. It’s just that both of them are extremely embarrassed, their clothes are broken, and all the protection is shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the point of transmission, another shot of light, like a real light, straight into the arms of Richard's mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard changed, and he did not expect that the uncertain chaotic physique would be so easy to attack. He slammed his teeth, tilted his body and let the light beam hit him on his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly screamed, and his large flesh and blood on his back were turned into nothing under the high-heat beam, and even the bones were burnt in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two immediately fell into the void, Richard reluctantly summoned three faces, of which the angel face chanting cure, the devil face chanting the flame immunity, and the neutral face Then recite the absolute sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three magics, Richard and Undecided fell on a light curtain. These light curtains are folded and form a temporary shelter to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-heat beam, if it is spiritual, wraps around the shelter a few times before returning to the transfer point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shelter, both No. and Richard are lying on the ground, and no one can move at any time. After a while, Richard was struggling to sit up. But he tried a few times and couldn't struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to act first. She walked over to Richard, silently turning over Richard and letting his back up, so as not to press on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I did not know how much blood was contaminated, I saw Richard’s injury at the moment, and my hands were still slightly trembling. But the only thing she can do is to do nothing about Richard’s injury. She follows the rules of chaos, she only knows how to kill and does not know how to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was on the ground and said, "You also crossed this passage at the beginning? It is a miracle that you didn't die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indefinitely, for a moment, said: "Maybe... the fate has not yet let me die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing her lonely tone, Richard trembled in his heart, then sighed: "You don't die, I still hope that you lead the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can only bring you here. The road behind, I have not passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing! Wait for me to heal my wounds.. .... Hey! Really hell!" When Licha moved, the wound on his back was touched, and he almost fainted. This is still the face of the angel of the order used him a cure, just barely stop the blood flow of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Qiang reluctantly took off a ring and said nothing about it: "Take out the things inside. There are... medicines." The injury is much heavier than the weight, but the strength of the ring that stimulates the space is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to take the ring, take a bottle of potent potion from inside, and then slowly pour the life potion on Richard's wound. As soon as the syrup touches the wound, it immediately sizzles and emits white smoke, just like being poured with strong acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately screamed loudly and screamed, and the unrecognized hands trembled. As a result, most of the bottles of medicine were poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton was even more screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how to bite his teeth, he made a strong effort on Richard’s buttocks and shouted: “Is this little injury, what is it so horrible?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not care to say: "What is there, not on the battlefield, not in front of outsiders, the pain is called, why care about the face. Hey!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;If you don’t listen to Richard’s words, your hands will tremble again, and then continue to pour the wound on Richard’s wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the effectiveness of the shelter was lost, Richard had returned to the state of his heyday and flew with a vortex with no directional vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard once again came out from a chaotic vortex, there was a new world of greatness immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of them, it is a vast and infinite abyss that simply does not feel the end, and countless chaotic eddies and ordering crystal rivers swirl around the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of Richard, you can’t see where the other end of the abyss is, maybe tens of millions of kilometers, maybe hundreds of millions of kilometers, maybe even more vast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is too big, too grand, so that Richard’s soul is taken for a moment, and the breath is held in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the first time I have seen such a scene, and I am also on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two superpowers of the Terran are tyrannical figures who have already fought in the peak of an entire era. At this moment, they are deeply felt in front of the wonders of the world. Your own small and insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this vast abyss, what big lord, what the devil, even the ants are not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Richard said: “This is the vortex of the eternal vortex?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing nodded: "It should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed deeply and said: "Now I believe, from here It is indeed possible to travel to the dark side of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the world have a dark side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe, maybe not. But we can't prove that it doesn't exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people have just discussed the nature of the world, and suddenly there is a very strong sense of danger in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indefinitely screaming, immediately instinctively into the arms of Richard, trying to squash himself to a minimum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is a serious face, while summoning three faces, one by one, the gods are layered on their own and indefinitely, in a flash, He didn't know how many shields were released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Richard screamed and screamed, and the protection of the three rule systems merged into a diamond-like crystal wall, which protected Richard and the indefinite stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the deepest part of the abyss, there is a little purple in the darkness that should not escape even light!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple eye expands, like a raging wave of anger from the darkness, instantly filled the entire abyss, and then spurted into the void like a volcano! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know how to describe the sight! In the field of vision, within the scope of perception, all purple chaos frenzy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple chaotic frenzy slowly fell back in the blink of an eye, gradually sinking into the bottom of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee and Undecided are also separated, silently watching the vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last frenzy is the breath of the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic frenzy sends chaotic energy that cannot be counted into the world, and the void immediately reacts, and countless stars of order power are generated in the void. Then they condensed into countless ordering crystal columns, and they fell into the eternal vortex, looking far away, just like the stars are falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian of the crystal wall was finally unable to support it, and it was broken. Richard's face is dignified, so chaotic frenzy, if it is hit in front, Su Hailun can't resist it. Now he can only pray, Su Hailun is not so arrogant, will run to the middle of the vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go on. Shiman's habitat should be at the edge of the vortex. If you can find the physical plane, that's probably it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I nodded. This time, he no longer took the indefiniteness, but walked side by side with her, and slowly explored the depths of the edge of the vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this all the way down, occasionally you can see a small piece of physical land floating in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the most violent, it is the quietest area. When you can see the land, you may have a plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha continued and went all the way down, flying in the air, the space in front of Richard suddenly moved, flying a little blue starlight from inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the drama is shocked, and the whole body is trembled. It seems that there is something to start to resonate. This is the star power left by Su Hailun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star Force has been extremely weak. After sensing that Richard’s physical strength is also derived from the deep blue sighing star power, it appears in front of Richard across a distant space. Space transmission has already consumed most of its power, just guiding Richard in a direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a hold and continued to transmit in the direction of Star Force. Not long after, there was a little starlight across the space in front of Richard. Such a little starlight is like a relay, gradually guiding Richard into the vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the destination may be in front, but Richard’s face is getting more and more ugly, he now understands what these star powers are, they originally It is a road sign prepared by Su Hailun for himself, in case he is lost in the vast sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This star power has a little bit of spirituality, they record the relevant coordinate information, and can automatically sense the owner's position, and then pass the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mystery of the Stars, dedicated to exploring unknown danger zones. A considerable part of the magical power in Richard's body has not been converted into Star Power, so this secret method is not used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the road sign left by Su Hailun has found Richard, what does this mean? Richard has already dared not think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
