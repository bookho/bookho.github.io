Richard gritted his teeth, such a small matter, there is still room for pushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time back to Noland, Richard sent someone to call the followers, and now he has nothing to do, so he has nothing to do with Vatican. I chatted a word, but I heard a lot of past events of the great priests. Vatican’s words are also very much today, and everything can be said with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea has been drunk over and over again, I don’t know when it’s from the time, at the request of Richard, it’s poured out from the small teapot that the power of time has condensed into. It became a wine, and with the wine, Richard became more comfortable, and talked with Vatican casually, like a long-awaited friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You kid, become more and more daring, just like your father when you were young, dare to make my joke." Vatican suddenly It’s like laughing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "This is not to please your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vatican’s lips showed a smile, and asked, “You are thinking of sand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, so I have to grieve." Richard said with a thick cheek, he found that his character seems to be changing, and the cause of the change is that he often drinks and screams at the bottom of the ordinary sanctuary on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline didn't want to let Richard go like this: "That's the way, don't think I don't know about you, you can go to Calando for the mountains and the sea, Almost died, in order to Su Hailun went to the field battlefield without saying anything, the sand, what kind of position she is in your heart, how are you going to deal with the relationship between the three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is not surprised that Vatican knows so much. As long as she is willing, she has almost nothing to know. Of course, the use of this powerful ability to force the sky, Vatican must also pay a lot of money, Vatican Being able to know so much, she can see her attention to the sand and Richard, but her problem is too sharp, directly stabbing the soft underbelly that Richard has been afraid to face, so that Richard is silent, ignoring Vatican. Behind the attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Richard opened his mouth, but did not have the following. He lowered his head and rubbed his hands hard. He did not know how to word it. Where should I start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First talk about what kind of status is flowing sand in your heart. Why don't you come to see her before going to the battlefield?" Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell, let me think..." Richard took a deep breath and then raised his head and said, "Teacher, Flowing sand and mountains and sea, who is more important, I can't tell, they are very important to me, it is important that I have to give everything to them, so I can't tell, go to Calando, go to the battlefield, all I have to do it. There is no reason to avoid it. As for not seeing the sand, it is because I know that once I see her, I am afraid I will not be able to go to the battlefield. In this case, even if there is only one possibility, I also I can't let it appear, I have to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline continues with an intriguing smile and asks: "The three of them are more important, if later They are in conflict, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another extremely sharp question, sharp to Richard, never thought about it, but since Van Gogh Lynn asked this, then she must answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up straight and thought for a few minutes. Suddenly he poured several large glasses of wine in a row and continued to drink it. His face quickly burst into a large flush. Until the wine rushed to the top of his head, Richard said with apologetic: "I am sorry, only in this state, I can say the most instinctive words, I think, this is the case..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish a sentence, suddenly seemed to feel a little, suddenly turned his head and looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the main hall, standing on the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she doesn’t look so beautiful, and she doesn’t have all kinds of styles. She’s just plain, so flat that people can almost ignore her existence. However, if she really went away, the blank left, it is so huge that it is too big for people to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not expect that the sand will appear at this time, suddenly stood up, but before he could talk, the sand was coming like a fly, a flying pounced him to the ground, and then he kissed him on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Running sand, how come you come back so early." Richard did not ask a word, he was stopped by the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wait, there is nothing to say, now you go out for a while, I have something to say to this old woman." Flowing sand murderously said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the fog, but was smashed out of the hall by the sloshing, and then the heavy door was slammed, and Richard I can only shrug my shoulders and lean against the wall, waiting for the results of the two generations of the gods to talk about it. As for what they talked about, Richard has no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wisdom is to evolve to the tenth order, and it is impossible to guess what the two women are talking about together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the flowing sand clenched his fists and stood in front of Vatican, like a little lion defending the territory, angered with hair roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old woman, what do you want to do, why should you ask him questions, why tell him about the relationship between us." Flowing sand is almost roaring It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline still smiles warm and beautiful, if a piece of warm jade, slowly said: "How do you feel so unsettled, I will see him The truth is forced out, this is not what you always wanted to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of sand suddenly disappeared, sitting down, holding his head I rubbed my hair hard and said, "I don't want to know it. I know what it means. If... If... In short, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In the heart of the sand, this question has been repeatedly thought of countless times, the order of ranking, really important, first and foremost, and finally how. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she is the first, she can't let Richard give up Su Helun and the mountains and the sea, even if she is at the end, she can't bear to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican gently stroked the hair of the sand, softly said: "You, it is too smart, too strong, but it does not matter, I will help you, even if it is a legendary legend, the other is full Karan I don’t want to be afraid of them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no slogan, but the head is buried in the arms of Vatican, and the shoulders are gently twitching. After a while, she wiped her face hard and raised her head. She smiled bitterly: "I know that he must be strong, and that he knows that one third of it is because of me, but this is not I want, I just want to... just want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed and said: "I just want him to come back safely." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin is silent, no slogan, although they are the generation of Tianjiao in the eyes of the world, in this kind of thing, it is no different from a small woman, they actually You don't need a man's peerless martial arts, you don't want to be a world leader, but just think that they can come back safely every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Philip, or Richard, but always reward them in their own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door, Richard waited for a bit of boring time, the door of the hall finally opened, and the sand was so bright that he rushed up to hold Richard. Arm, said: "Go, sacrifice, let me see how many sacrifices you have prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately felt that the hard work of the year was Worth, spirited, smiled: "Make sure you are unexpected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot is it." With Richard's arm, it is not exaggerated, but the unusually elastic chest is constantly rubbing on Richard's arm and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly found out that when the sand was crazy, it was so difficult to resist, and it was not a very appropriate thing to have a physical reaction in the Eternal Dragon Hall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many sacrifices there are." The sands are all hung on Richard's body, biting his ear and asking. Richard immediately returned a number. As a builder, he also killed countless battlefields. Several times, for a whole year, he has won the equivalent of two top-level sacrifices, and this speed is not much slower than the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
