			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Reapers in the core plane of Richard! The news spread, and the lords and strong men of the entire continent reacted differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried, there is an immediate contact with Archimonde to support, but also gloating, and even feel that the time is ripe, you can conspire in Richard What. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong ones are concerned about another message accompanying this message. Archimonde's two points battlefields are still valid, and the points redemption is carried out as usual, except that the bulk of the military supplies are missing. In addition, Richard will choose to open the third integral battlefield, that is, facing the reaper's battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nightfall, a team of knights escorted fifteen top sacrifices to Faust. Richard immediately set off for the sacrifice at the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice ceremony of Richard is still hosted by Nolan. He personally carries a giant box that is several times larger than himself and goes to the altar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like countless times in the past, the curtain of time rises and the altar quietly jumps into the depths of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the sacrifices on the altar and watched them turn into the power of time. Next, a large number of graces came, and Richard chose to strengthen the plane of the planes of Faro and Noland several times, and strengthened until it could not be strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next grace, Richard chose a lot of equipment and rare materials. This time, Richard did not choose materials that were equivalent to a top-level offering, but rather selected relatively large materials. These materials can be used to make epic-level weapons, and the power of the people below the Sanctuary is extremely obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Reaper is a war, and Richard’s own strength is limited. He must have a strong army to block the reaper and then withdraw his core members to Noland as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Dragon of Eternity and Time still takes great care of Richard, and the list basically satisfies the needs of Richard. At least you can't see the ingredients that are deliberately martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice was completed very quickly, and at the foot of Richard, there were more than ten silver sealed boxes of silver, which were all materials exchanged by Richard. These sealed boxes work extremely finely, completely different from Noland's complicated and versatile style, but a simple and smooth industrial style, which is similar to the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if there are too many items for Richard’s exchange, and the eternal and time dragons actually put the materials in the package! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice was over, and Richard suddenly felt a hard object in his pocket. That is the machine in the end of the rì mark, which has been pinched into a solid metal ball by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard’s heart, he threw the metal ball on the altar. To his surprise, a strip of time and light stretched out from the void, wrapped around the metal ball, and broken down into pure power of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing can also sacrifice? When Richard was shocked, he suddenly thought of a sacrifice, and the Eternal and Time Dragon once said that he would give extra grace to the sacrifices associated with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of time in the air gathered in one place, and then dropped a few crystals of pale gold. This time, there was no room for Richard to choose, and it directly gave the gods a crystal. It is just that, this is one of the materials that Richard currently needs most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the sacrifice, Richard summoned several costume knights to come in and remove a box of materials from the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outer sea of ​​the northeastern border of the Faro continent, a layer of scorpion suddenly appeared in the sky, a diameter of ten meters, a length of nearly 100 meters, a hexagonal prism The metal column emerged from the shackles and slid silently in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal column, from time to time, lit up a light strip, it is very strange. Below it is the sea, and the distant horizon is looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slowly fell, plunged into the cold sea, then continued to sink, and was in contact with the seabed tens of meters deep underwater, which stopped. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the metal column is opened, a number of brackets are ejected, the tip is deeply penetrated into the seabed, firmly fixed, and then it is tilted and stands in the sea, and another One end is exposed to the sea for several meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal column suddenly trembled, and hundreds of metal sticks with a fist size and a length of more than one meter were ejected from the column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These metal sticks change rapidly, turning into a miniature hull of various shapes in a blink of an eye, swimming in the sea to the four hundred and eight sides. They sneaked very fast, even faster than the fastest swordfish in the middle of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These miniature ships sneaked into the water at speeds of more than 100 kilometers per hour, and any aquatic creatures encountered on the way would be slaughtered by them. Other micro-ships will eject a transparent net to capture different aquatic creatures. When they are caught in sufficient quantities, they will be towed back to the mother ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of these reapers is small, but the power is extremely amazing, dragging some dozens of meters of big fish, can still fly forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those aquatic creatures that were slaughtered, the body flesh and blood will be collected, compressed into a fusiform piece of meat, and then transported to the mothership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty micro-ships have just floated on the surface of the water, and then the boot wings, flying faster than the underwater speed. Detect this plane in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the top of the mother ship shaped like a metal column suddenly split, and hundreds of metal rods only half a meter long. They immediately became a small aircraft flying at a high speed of more than 500 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother ship hull in the sea opened several cracks and began to inhale the seawater and then sprayed it from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly shook, a large piece of metal split from the body, and the body was one-third less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This metal became a square ship, slowly moving forward, then climbed onto the land, deformed on the spot, and appeared in place. A towering building with several spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opened several small doors underneath, dozens of sized dog-sized mechanical beetles sneak out and began to dig on the spot. They dig what they see and dig a box and ship it back into the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the building immediately illuminates countless straight lines, and there is a constant flow of light inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more mechanical beetles climbed out of the building. At this time, the second square ship also floated out of the sea, and the distance was several kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it formed a flat polygonal building. Some of the mechanical beetles were transported from the first workshop-style building to the second building, which was in operation immediately. After a while, the top opened, flying out a small battleship several meters long, and then flying into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, there are more and more reaper units on the promontory, while the coastline is gradually shortening. The corner of the earth seems to have a black dot, and then it quickly becomes a dark spot, and it is spreading more quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a castle in Erhai, Gangde suddenly woke up from a nightmare and found that he had a cold sweat, his underwear was soaked, saying no Uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed up from the bed and glanced out the window. At this moment, the sky was very dim, as if it had just dawned. In fact, the magic clock in the corner has already pointed to 10 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other side of the window, you can see the sea. The sea here is dark gray, and the sea is covered with clouds. At the end of the horizon, the sea and the sky blend into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde frowned and whispered a few words. Look at this ghost weather, it is about to snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates snow. In this extremely northern region, a heavy snow can often last for a few days, and it is extremely limited whether it is marching or fighting. And Gangde is a bald head, he never likes to wear a helmet. The snow falls on his bald head and turns into ice water flowing into the neck, which is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde put on his clothes, opened the door and shouted: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Several soldiers and adjutants came over together. The pro-arms began to help Gangde to wear armor, while the adjutant began to report the latest military situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde frowned as he listened and said, "Why did the first and third Sword Shield Infantry Legions have not yet set off? What are they grinding? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant cautiously said: "Adult, it’s only twenty hours since you moved the order to the present. They need to gather and stand outside the stronghold. Troops, tidy up the camp supplies"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
