			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearly 100 fighters in the center of the fighter group suddenly stopped, and then disintegrated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard is flashing, launching an instant transmission, jumping into the center of the next group of fighters. The group of fighters also burst into flames, a fighter or disintegration, or was detonated by the power metal inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to jump in short space, and the speed of assault has increased tenfold! Others have long been unable to keep up with him, but they still rushed to the center of the base before the scheduled plan, and then suddenly dispersed, each looking for a fleet to rush in, to destroy the large and small fighters into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are only a few people, the entire Reaper base is full of fire everywhere, and the roaring sounds one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful one is Freire. In the range of hundreds of meters around her, from time to time, there is a group of viscous prison fires popping up. And then stay there and burn out without burning out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of prison fire can burn for hours and is extremely hot. They clumped out in a cluster, and the reaper's fighters often slammed into the air and slammed into the flames. It would not be long before it would explode. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Freire empty-handed, he will fish out a large piece of flame like a melt, and then throw a piece of it on the ground. In the marine unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea are another battle mode, she is still using an unremarkable iron rod, but the iron rod weighing hundreds of tons actually The level of the artifact has been reached, and each stroke will leave a gray trail in the air for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t have to really hit the Reaper unit, as long as she is in the range of tens of meters in gray, she will be sucked around the track. Then it is squeezed by a force that is suddenly increased by dozens of times to be distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Reaper’s resistance is still tenacious, and the reaper parts that are destroyed or hit are mostly still moving, constantly deforming, constantly being pulled by magnets. In general, gather together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They get rid of parts that are completely destroyed, can't be used, and then try to form a new fighter. After a while, when enough parts were glued together, a new fighter plane vacated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle with the Reaper, it is very important to destroy them again when the parts are reorganized. But now, within the Reaper's base, the Goshawks are completely unable to take care of these reorganized fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Freire can occasionally throw a prison fire and burn a bunch of fighters that are being reorganized. And the other fighters can't even kill the fighters on the other side. How can I have time to deal with the parts that are still active? But purely in terms of killing effect, Freire is the lowest. The Reaper's resistance to the flames was surprisingly high, and more than half of the fighters she was blasting could be reorganized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire base is over the sky, the high-energy beams are criss-crossed, almost woven into a large net, constantly bombarding on everyone, stimulating the energy of the whole piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire added a lava shield to himself, but a thick layer of magma was quickly thinned and vaporized by a high-energy beam. She had to make up the layers of shields and it was getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's attack efficiency against Freire began to increase significantly. Her fighting style has apparently been cracked and resolved, and this has not happened in other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is coming and going, the giant sword is swaying, that is, the reaper of the film explodes. And those parts that are splashed out can keep the activity crawling together and recombined, relatively much less. The totem pattern on her face is constantly shining, one when attacking, and the other two when moving. As for the protection, the body of the barbarian is extremely strong, and the ordinary reaper has left her a little injury, she simply does not look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godhawk’s fighting style may be the most strange. He throws a plasma ball and then swells the tens of meters of blue grid in the air. . The power of the power grid is not strong, and if it is placed in ordinary combat, it may not even kill a sanctuary. However, as long as the reapers in the power grid will explode, even the medium-sized fighters will sway to the ground and need to be repaired for a long time to re-launch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plasmaballs are clearly designed for the reaper, which stimulates and detonates the power metal in the reaper's body. Even a large fighter or a warship is just a matter of a few plasma balls. This is the result of the Goshawk and the Reaper fighting for many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the faceless battle is the most relaxed, her whole body shines brightly, and all the artifacts of the armor are stimulated, and each piece of nails is as clean as a mirror. The high-energy beam shines on her body, and most of the power is reflected back, which in turn burns many miniature and small fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of reapers is too much, and they have gone on and on, as if they are not exhaustive. Although the Goshawks are regarded as the top powerhouses of the Terran, they still fail to gain the advantage of the battlefield and gradually fall into the quagmire of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no easy thing for Richard. The reapers he faces are always the most, and he has taken up half of the entire base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a roaring thunder in the sky. At this moment, the air is full of twisted and intertwined force fields, and even Richard does not dare to make space in this environment. Transfer, but can only rely on their own speed to hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care about the reaper’s attack, and his heart slammed directly into the center of a large group of thousands of fighters in front of him. Destroyed hundreds of fighters and then rushed out from the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hard battle made Richard's body bruises, but it also caused instant confusion to the reaper. The command system apparently could not keep up with this type of attack that completely exceeded the analytical model. The rain-like high-energy beams and metal kinetic energy bombs all fell through, but they blew up thousands of their own fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reaper fighters are still too many, just in front of Richard, hundreds of thousands of fighters have completed the assembly, they turned into a huge silver The tornado is half on the ground and half on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s pupils are shrinking, knowing that at the center of the tornado is the ultimate goal of this battle, the reaper’s mother ship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard has suddenly increased to the extreme, Then, the tornado consisting of 100,000 fighters moved irregularly, flashing through another set of fire attack. His analysis of the reaper is almost as fast as he can, and the pattern of the reaper's lock and set fire is also familiar. In this way, a deadly set fire can be flashed every time in a thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reaper is so good to deal with. Less than three seconds later, all the reaper fighters suddenly gave up the fire and changed to the surrounding without a difference! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Cha was caught off guard, and was hit by several high-energy beams, followed by a storm-like fire attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering of high-energy beams and kinetic energy bombs is so much that a sudden glimmer of light shines in the air. It’s just a moment, then the light becomes absolute darkness, and a faint aura is centering on the darkness and swaying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper fighters that were plucked by the halo all suddenly became distorted and transparent, and then there was no entity like it, and the annihilation annihilated! Even warships are no exception! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this aura is so big that it is invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halo spreads for several kilometers, and this finally disappears, yet it has torn a big hole in the reaper's fighter tornado! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the center of the halo has finally dissipated, revealing Richard hiding in the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now huddled in a group, and the light curtain of the tetrahedron in his body is almost invisible, but still stubbornly Rotating. His clothes all over the body have disappeared under the horrible energy of the genius, and even the legendary knives are annihilated. Only the animal tooth necklace and the three artifact long knives can be damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the corner of the regular tetrahedron of Richard’s body has disappeared, and accordingly, one of the right feet that Richard has exposed has disappeared. The beveled incision on the calf is exceptionally smooth, and the peristalsis of the blood vessels can be clearly seen. It is also possible to see the rune with a shimmer on the skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard's power to destroy the projections formed his own rule of the country, and finally forced against the tens of thousands of reapers. But this blow also completely defeated the power of his destruction of the projection, and the next time, Richard will be completely erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Richard wants is just an opportunity, once is enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly opened his eyes, the whole person like a meteor into the huge gap of the fighter tornado, the speed is fast, even dragging a long distance behind him Flame tail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Richard, the three faces once again emerged, each sprinkling a magical spell with different rules of God: "Destruction."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three small fireballs of different colors spit out from the mouth of the three faces, then flew up into the sky, disappearing into the group of reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard himself drank a very complicated and sacred language: "calling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the complex semiotics in the second half of the divine language, The fugues of the three rules of chaos, order and neutrality are all integrated, and all of them are the objects of his summoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cooperate with this god, Richard’s hands are constantly waving, and one portal after another is outlined in the speed of movement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoner finally appeared, it was a dragon! It was probably pulled out by the raw and pulled out. It tumbling directly from the void and flew out, then hard into the group of fighters and flew more than a dozen fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant faint fainting, just instinctively scratching, but have not waited for it to see what is happening around, a high-energy beam swept over and immediately Burned into a black keel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first unlucky dragon has just fallen, and there are dozens of dragons, including physical dragons, most of them are magic dragons. The flying performance of the magic dragon is still normal, and the physical dragon is completely ejected from the void, like a cannonball to the reaper's fighter group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another small chaos in the Reaper fleet, and the command system seemed to be disturbed again by the war cases not found in the model. However, it was still normal in a very short time, and then the murderous murder efficiency of the reaper was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-energy beam suddenly woven into a large net, even if there is only a little gap, they can accurately shoot at the dragon without accidentally injuring the already fighter. This sniper smashed the dragon that was summoned by Richard in the most chaotic situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time is enough, Richard’s call to God is not completed until this time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half plane of Su Helun, a huge beam of light fell from the void, completely covering the dragon country, all the dragons inside were turned into streamers, one by one Fly to the void and disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in the original position of Richard, there are three huge portals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rush of light, a portal began to burst into a group of dragons, and the other portal spewed out a variety of things, from the devil The devil until the lich, the bone demon, anyway, summoning the creatures that the Master once summoned, can be found here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
