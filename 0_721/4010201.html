Have you brought back good news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caught a big man!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big man?" The elf elder elder was excited, but he immediately calmed down and asked seriously: "How do you judge him to be a big man?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind is ready, handing a magical sword and saying, "This is the weapon used by the knight. You can try its power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders mentioned the giant sword, and the left hand picked up a bone knife commonly used by the elves, but the bone of the knives was more dense and smooth, and the patterns carved on it were more detailed and beautiful. When the elder elder waved the magical sword, he chopped it to the bone knife. He only heard the sound of a crack, and even made a metal tapping sound. The refined bone blade in the hand of the elf elder has been broken into two sections, and the fracture is very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders sighed with a long breath and stunned: "A good sword! Even the bone knife blessed by the tree of life can't stop it." Jianfeng, this person seems to be in the identity of the intruder is absolutely not low!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenwind is pleased to say: "So, we have the opportunity to put Zhu Cloth. Spiritual Rescue came back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders slowly nodded and said: "The spirit is the only one except the whole, the whole tribe can communicate. The Druid of the Tree of Life, he is the foundation and hope of our tribes. We must find ways to save him back, but we can't let the invaders notice the importance of the spirit. Otherwise, we will have no hope. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green wind nodded and said: "The important person in this intruder has been seized, and the grasp of the spirit of the spirit has been much greater. The problem is, What do we do in the future? The invaders are still rushing out of the Devil's Gate, and their number is endless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves The wrinkles on the face of the elders were much deeper. Shen Sheng asked: "How many warriors have we lost now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the new intruder from the devil After the arrival of the gate, the adult warriors in the tribe had already died of 106 people, and the war tree people also destroyed twenty. The spirit wind was captured by the invaders,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say that half of the warriors in our tribe have died under the devil's minions?" said the elder elder bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the green wind is equally bitter: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf elders went to the window Before, watching the young elves who leaped and danced between the branches of the giant branches, sighed: "Maybe... we should try to negotiate with them instead of directly launching the war. The invaders before and after are obviously different tribes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind screams, the loud voice: "The great elders! They are the invaders coming out of the door of the devil! No matter how many tribes they belong to, They are all intruders. We must never compromise with the invaders. They must drive them back to the devil's door and destroy the devil's door! This is war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The elf elder sighed and asked: "Is this all Druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind sighed and said: "There are six Druids who support me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders nodded and silently. There are a total of ten Druids in the tribe, one of which hurts and one prisoner. That is to say, only one Druid does not agree with the green wind, and the rest are supporters of the green wind. That is to fight the invaders to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf elders slowly said: "Only the three tribes around the door of the devil are not the opponents of the invaders. Perhaps we should make a good life." The tree is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this be! The tree of life has been here for thousands of years!" The green wind shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do? If the intruder finds it here, it will be too late to migrate!" The elder elder was also angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible! We will never let an intruder have a chance to touch the tree of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes? How many of you Druids have the confidence to defeat the invaders?" The elf big elders are not at all polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind has a green face on his face, and he said: "We will defend the tree of life with life!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you all died in battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green wind, he never thought about going from the elder elders Say such a thing. And he never thought about how to defeat or die. In the eyes of Druid, death is nothing but a process of returning to nature, and it is not worth fearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder once again asked: "If all the Druids are killed, the invaders will let go of the tree of life and will let them go." Are there no adult people? If the invaders’ army is here, can you have one tenth of them to defeat them?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green wind’s face The more ugly it is. He is fighting, but since the new invaders arrived at Greenson through the Devil's Gate, their situation has gone from bad to worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longevity of the Devil's Gate has weakened the power of their tribes in the past few months, although other tribes around have not stopped providing various assistance, But their tribes are weakening in the long run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new intruder is more like a fox, more aggressive, and there have been many more formidable powerhouses. Their weapons and armor suddenly have incredible power. The green wind has never seen a weapon that can break the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind can only deceive yourself, and can only say that it is desperate with the invaders. Although this time, he successfully captured an important person in the invaders, but at the cost of more than a dozen war trees. Those war tree people knew from the beginning that they could never return. They are slow to escape the intruder's pursuit. If it is not the spirit of the wind is too important, then this exchange is an uncompromising defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green wind, you think about it, because of your Druid’s honor and belief, you need to let the entire tribe, let the tree of life destroy it. Can you really bear this responsibility with the seven Druids? Remember, this is a few hundred lives. So far, we have paid more than a hundred lives." The elder elder said heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green wind opened his mouth and ended up saying: "I don't believe that those invaders can penetrate the protection of the forest will."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you are right." The elder elder was full of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Wind didn’t say anything, and after a trip, he left the tree house. He jumped directly from the air, turned into a falcon, flew hundreds of meters, landed at the root of the tree of life, and then changed back to the elf form. In front of the green wind, it is a deep tree hole, and two elf warriors are guarding the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the hole." Green wind commanded. An elf warrior immediately patted the wall of the tree hole, and the vines that blocked the hole immediately fell and let the passage open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind strode into the tree hole, circling all the way, until the ground is more than ten meters deep, before embarking on the flat. This is a natural cave, the roots of countless trees of life hang down, and the wide gaps are divided into dozens of small rooms. One or several human warriors are held in each cubicle. These are the captives captured a month ago. After Richard arrived at the Greenson plane, the newly added prisoner in this prison had only one elite knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite humanoid knight is sitting on the ground at this moment, his eyes are slightly closed, his face is expressionless, and he does not care about the dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of resentment shot on the elite humanoid knight, and finally turned to other cells. The humanoid knight never spoke, no matter what the situation, how to torture, he is a dull expression. Only occasionally looking into the eyes of the elves, it will contain murder that is not easy to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a language barrier. The Druids have found that there are many invaders who can use their language. In the interrogation, the expression of the humanoid knight is very Less, but obviously not a bit unrecognizable. Even if you don't understand it completely, the meaning of the knife holder on the neck is straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind feels restless, the Cavaliers’ reaction is too calm, and the calm is unbelievable. He instinctively felt that there was any conspiracy among them, but he could not find any concrete evidence. Suddenly he couldn’t control himself. He said to the two soldiers in the prison room next to the humanoid knight: "Now you are no longer useful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green wind popped two seeds and shot them on the two fighters. The vines grew wildly at an incredible speed. After a dozen seconds, they were covered with the bodies of two warriors, and they were firmly tied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vines are full of thorns ranging from a few centimeters to a dozen centimeters, deeply plunging into the soldiers' bodies. Then the vines began to bulge together, and the hollow thorns produced a huge suction force, forcing the soldiers' flesh and blood to tear and sucking into the cane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of the two warriors screamed through the prison, and the rest of the soldiers felt the same, they were afraid, some yelled, Some are desperately blocking their ears. Only the elite humanoid knight sat quietly, occasionally glanced at the warrior who was sucked by the blood-sucking vines, and his face remained calm as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of the two fighters quickly weakened and even disappeared. There are many bloody veins in the stems and leaves of the vampire vine. It slowly squirmed, and began to bloom a large number of beautiful white flowers, a cluster of stalks at the root of the flower bulging at a speed visible to the naked eye, inside is a new blood-sucking vine seed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green wind was gloomy and shot four seeds, killing four human warriors alive, but the humanoid knight is still calm. In the end, the green wind really felt that there was no meaning in this way. He snorted and his face was blue and he left the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
