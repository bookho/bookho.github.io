			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin sighed and said, "It will be like this in the morning and evening, isn't it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope also sighed and said, "Maybe, I used to try to avoid the situation like today, but it seems that I am a failure, Martin, at the beginning When I personally handed the book of Destiny to you, I was looking forward to the day when you were able to take over my duties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lufei De's face It seems a bit unnatural at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of destiny, St. Martin’s face was full of anger and snorted and said, “Would you give me the book of destiny? Is it really kind? If I had a pair of eyes that could limit my fate and know your intentions, I would not have encountered a disaster linked to the book of destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard’s heart is moving, the book of destiny, now hanging on his waist, becomes a few pages in the book of Destruction, listening to St. Martin’s statement, as long as If there is a book of destiny, there will be a disaster that cannot be avoided. It seems that when Martin sent him the book of destiny, he did not have any good intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled slowly and said, "I gave you the book of Destiny because you have eyes that can see through your fate. Only you can The book of destiny finds the final destination, freeing the church from the passive situation of the book that has consumed the power of faith for thousands of years to suppress the destiny. Now it seems that you have found a master for the book of destiny, isn't it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the pope’s gaze fell on Richard and gave him a meaningful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope regained his gaze and looked at St. Martin, saying, "Martin, come back, I am tired, old, and as soon as you come back, I will take me. The position is handed over to you, you are the new pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Feide was shocked and lost his voice: "How does this work, the Pope, you must be careful ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope raised his left hand and made a squeaking expression. His hand was dry and yellow, covered with a little bit of old spots on the index finger. Holding a huge legal ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was such a simple gesture that Lufide had a chill in his life and never dared to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s statement is obviously bigger than St. Martin’s expectation. He silently smiled for a long time and said, “I also want to think about it, although the Lord has not responded for a long time. Our prayers, but I still don't want to abandon the vows that I made before the icon. His Majesty, Pope, I accidentally knew your plan. You want to rely on the power of the church, intercept the faith, seal yourself, and replace the glory. The Lord of the Lord, I am sorry, I can't agree with this path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin's words are thundering and blasting in everyone's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope wants to seal himself and replace the position of the Lord of Glory. If St. Martin’s is true, it’s enough to shock the entire Noland. The big secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also unbelievable, but then changed his face and realized an important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether St. Martin’s is true or not, today’s World War I is inevitable, but this is exactly what Richard did not expect. He originally wanted to put Thomas. And his army defeated, but to control the overall size of the war, after all, this is still in the land of the sacred dynasty, but now, it has evolved into a full-scale war with the church headed by the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lufeid responded very quickly and immediately shouted: "Martin, you dare to smother the pope, jihadist angels, give me the heresy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Lufide, four mysterious figures in robes are taking off their robes at the moment, and the body illuminates the dazzling glory, and one piece of heaven is armed with them. The body emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of Heavenly Armed Forces is unique. They look like different styles of armor, full of majesty in the Light, four heavenly arms, each A devout believer is familiar with Uli, Rafael, Gabriel, and Remir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these jihadist angels appear, the morale of the big army below is violent, some cheers, and more are snarling in their chests, Believers, this is a miracle that is rare in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four jihad angels marched side by side and slowly flew to St. Martin, the sword in the hands of the Glorious Lord, for the believers who are also the Lord of Glory. Words have a strong repressive effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the people behind St. Martin, some people have already shown fear. The intense light of the jihad angels is not useless decoration. Once they enter the range of light, they will always be burned by divine power, and the speed will be greatly slowed down and continued. The ground bears the damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, every jihad angel was the core of the battlefield, with the ability to control the local battle, and the light on them could affect the range of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the continent was in Calando, Richard also played against the kingdom of heaven, because it was a one-on-one battle, so the opponent did not start the divine light, the jihad angel It is a killer for the battlefield. The energy consumption used in one-on-one duel is not as good as that used directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sacred glory of the four jihad angels is superimposed, whether it is the weakening of the combat power or the continuous damage, it has reached a fairly high degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin sighed at this moment and said, "Come out, Midrand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, the three holy warriors took off their robes, and the body also flashed a dazzling light. In the light, a piece of nails appeared quickly, forming a whole body armor, and the light red sè light behind the armor, Then let the church knights below exclaim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red sè light wing, that is the unique mark of Midrand, the legendary king of the lost angel Midalun, actually appeared in the hands of St. Martin, And actually it is three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midalen is known as the king of angels, and has a very high position among the people of heaven. At this moment, three of the priests and the four jihad angels of the Pope’s side are opposite each other. The sacred radiance of the two sides eroded and repelled each other. In the sky, the sacred light and the red sè light were intertwined and surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the red ray that belongs to Midrande quickly gained the upper hand and continued to fill three-fifths of the airspace. It began to enter the state of being in harmony with the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin finally breathed a sigh of relief. His three Midaruns were one less than the Pope, but the momentum was not weak, but it was faintly suppressed. The opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was most worried about whether the three Midrandes could hold back the four jihad angels of the other side. Now, from the results, Richard’s level of construction Martin’s expectations are even higher, and it can even be said to have exceeded the level of St. Peter’s heyday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin couldn't help but regret it. If there were two more Midrandes, the situation would be different, but there were only three tribes in the saints who could drive the armed forces of heaven. No more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing three Midranden, Lufide’s eyes are almost straight. He pointed to St. Martin and lost his voice: “You dare to do this, Midrande fell into your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Pope’s god, as usual, smiled and said: "Martin, you make me very disappointed Do you think that the identity of the Son can make you yell at it? It seems that you are well prepared for today's war, but this is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope turned and said to the Gate of the Light: "Come out, Michael, you can prove my piety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light Gate Once again, there is a strong radiance. A strong, elegant figure emerges from the light. Behind him, three pairs of huge wings stretched out. When the light wings reached the end, the light suddenly became hot. pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, like a new sun in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin's face immediately changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment behind St. Martin, there is a girl who is all light, she has four light wings, the girl stares at Michael, looks angry Extremely, screamed: "Mikele, do you also betray the Lord of Glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred angels of the Six Wings are expressionless and slowly fly to the battlefield His golden sè light spreads beyond the kilometer, and where the golden sè shines, even the fascinating light of Midranden is constantly being eliminated or expelled. In the twinkling of an eye, Midalun is comprehensive. pressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Michael looked at the girl and said coldly: "I am loyal to the light, the glory is the Lord, but the Lord is not necessarily brilliant. Who will be recognized by the Light, who is the Lord of glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." The girl was shocked and could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, and a momentary movement flashed to Martin and asked: "This Michael feels very different, what is going on."
