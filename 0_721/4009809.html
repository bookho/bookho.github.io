Next, hit the waist and hit the team in progress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two priests turned their heads and looked at them, and they immediately showed a terrified expression on their faces. They were on the path of the boulder! The rolling stone rumbling and the thunder of the thunder rushed down, and the violent wind has come one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special energetic Sir Mintel or with a level of up to thirteen can resist the boulder, but even if he is a captain, he is hit by a rolling stone. Both are seriously injured. The team below was suddenly flustered. The priests who were the first to bear the brunt and the knights who were closest to them, some ran forward, some retreated, and the queues of the forwards and the soldiers behind the temple were so rushed, and the chaos spread. After someone collided with each other, they could not find the direction, and even ran into the range of the falling points that the boulder was about to kneel down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the ogre brothers 'wow' made an amazing scream, slamming the ground, the whole steep slope trembled, rolling The boulder moved slightly in the direction and headed for the front of the team. Suddenly, the situation has become more chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral's pupil suddenly shrinks, the right hand is loose, the arrow is off the string! The long arrow is accompanied by a layer of light-blue magical light that adds a magical effect of limited locking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mintel can’t take care of the running of the squad, just wanting to rush to block the boulder, suddenly the red light flashes in sight, it’s actually a fireball. Shooted out in the woods, and facing a group of warriors crowded together in chaos! Fireball less than two seconds of flight time, those soldiers simply can not escape the scope of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz roared, grabbed a big shield, strode forward, and even intercepted the fireball halfway! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the magical flame blasted on the shield of the Great Shield, and the hot fire spurted. But Sir Mintel firmly held the shield, and even one step did not retreat, and the flaming vindictiveness pushed away the fire that rushed to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wave passed, except for the softening of the edge of the big shield, Sir Mintel was unscathed. However, his ears sharply captured the looming sharp whistling from far and near, which is the whistling sound of the magic arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz suddenly stood up from behind the shield, just to see a long arrow shining with magical light passing by, not into the back of the older priest! The arrow tip came straight out from the front chest, and the priest’s body rang twice with a slight squeak, which was the sound of the internal organs being damaged. Seeing the appearance of the priest falling to the ground, there is no sign of life at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the temple was killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Sir Mintel’s eyes almost spurted out the flames. He pulled out the sword and screamed and rushed to the steep slope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enveloped knights who were waking up immediately pulled out their weapons, and they illuminate the various colors of the temper, and they attacked the sneak attack at full speed. There were several captains who were known for their speed. When they rushed to the top of the hill, they had gone hand in hand with Sir Mintel. However, when he rushed into the forest, Mintel saw that Richard was stretching his hands and had just completed the last spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold ice wind pours out of Richard's hands, and the ice wind is filled with countless shiny cones! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first moment, Sir Mintel judged that this is a four-level magic cone of magic that is more powerful than fireball. He shouted carefully, and he immediately stopped his footsteps, placing the big shield on the ground in front of him, and his body was completely retracted into the shield. Even if he is hit by a cone of ice, he will be hurt. The defended knights also defended on the spot, but there was still a slow response before the two steps, and then the ice cones that were flying in the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling ice wind lasted for two full seconds, with a dense ice cone constantly hitting Mintel’s big shield, while the surrounding cones hit the ice cone and hit the armor. Or the sound of the knight's hand shield. From time to time, the Cavaliers make a painful snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice wind is finally over, Mintel’s body surface has been covered with a thick layer of frost. He suddenly made a profit, and the frost covered with it shattered and fell to the ground. Mintai face cold frost, looking around, the Knights were all somewhat injured, one of them was seriously injured. In order to be light, they only wore a lock with limited defense, but they paid a price. And Richard has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave ten people, carry him down, and protect the priest's body. The rest come with me, the magician has put two magic, up to There are still one or two fireballs, afraid of anything! Give me chase!" Min Tai screamed, the captains led the soldiers to rush into the forest, chasing away the traces left by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the reloaded warrior is clearly not catching up with the enemy, but the light scouts succeeded in biting Richard. After a few kilometers of chasing in the forest, a sealed knight who was known for his speed and mountain warfare came back from the front and reported that Sir Mintel had found a strong wall in front of him. The intruders fled to the stronghold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Sir is not shocked and said: "The dog breeds fled back to the nest? Just happened! Come with me, let's go and put this pile of chopped One pot end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the forces of Sir Mintel have surrounded the forward base. Sir Mintel was not eager to attack, but turned around the forward base and saw all the terrains clearly before returning to the main entrance of the base and asking the young priest who was sweating: "This is an invasion. The base of the person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young pastor is looking at a map and then replies with incomprehensibility: "This is the place indicated in the shrine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz nodded and said to the young pastor: "You hide behind, don't use it with magic, maybe my person needs your magic. Help. I will send someone to protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a small team of soldiers gathered in the priest and returned to the woods. Mintai does not want him to do anything else. The priest of the temple is noble. If there are any casualties, it will be difficult to explain to the temple. Even if the intruder can finally be captured and sent to God for trial, it can only be regarded as a supplement. As for the help of the magic, Minta does not think that a third-level priest can do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the team has been assembled, Mintel raised his eyes and observed the forward base dozens of meters away. The wall of the invader's lair is stone-built and is about four meters high. The two thick wooden gates were tightly closed, and there was an arrow tower attacking on the left and right to cover the position in front of the base. At the moment, there was a shooter in the arrow tower. The strength of the condensate showed extraordinary strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a level of knights, bastard!" Mintel murmured a swearing sigh, his gaze then fell on the Li, above the gate. Recognizing this is the magician who sneaked on them in the forest. The magician is standing above the gate, which is a dangerous but critical position. Seeing that Richard was standing there, Mintel even wanted to find a bow to shoot an arrow now. However, this kid escaped quickly in the forest. It was not like a magician. Mintel, who was not good at archery, could not shoot him with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
