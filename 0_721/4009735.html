			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s residential area sounded a long-lost roar, and Minnie shrank in the corner of the sofa without saying a word. There was another bright red handprint on her face. In the experimental area, several of the Soram's magic alchemists are busy in front of the experimental platform. They all have a wealth of knowledge of the magical structure. Although they cannot be a true builder due to lack of talent, they are The mid-term processing of the material, as well as the partial mapping of the magic array, played a significant role in saving a lot of time for Stevenson. Hearing the snarl of Stevenson, they looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders, only when they heard nothing, and buried their work in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Stevenson smashed a vase, but he couldn't dissolve the depression in his chest. He couldn't help but scream: "Richard! It's Richard! How many things do he still know? First, Su Hailun, now It is the princess of the millennial dynasty. Why do all the women look at him? Look at the child who hasn’t even had a long hair?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶吼Slightly poured After a little anger in the chest, Stevenson turned to look at Minnie. Minnie is beautiful and intelligent, but she is defeated in various fields compared with the mountains and the sea. Even the appearance, the mountains and the sea also stabilized and regulated her. Perhaps the place where Minnie used to be able to compare with the mountains and the sea is temperament. It is really hard to divide the frost and the wild power, but the mountains and the sea are more pure. But that is a thing of the past. Now Minnie is only pitiful, and her self-confidence and cold arrogance have been exhausted under repeated blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Stevenson, Minnie in front of her eyes is full of cumbersome, not to mention the slightest help. It is even less likely to have decisive help for Richard like the mountains and the sea. Minnie is very clear about the meaning of Stevenson's gaze, even if it is still illusory, it will be clear after a slap in the face. She suddenly sneered a little, sat up straight, and stood up in front of Stevenson, saying: "The girl is called the mountain and the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, I know what her name is. I also know that she is the granddaughter of the Garland Emperor! Everyone in the dark blue knows this now, but also needs you to say?!" Stevenson once again could not suppress his temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that she has amazing wealth and used Bethel's arachnid as money." Minnie's voice is still calm and calm, it seems that she is not afraid of it. Devenson might once again be violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Warlock smiled exaggeratedly: "I know this too! When she first paid with Spider Crystal, I was the one who was hit by her. Do you want to ridicule me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini smiled softly and said: "She is now living with Richard. That is, her Wealth can be used for Richard. Even if it is just a top grade Bethel arachnid, you can use gold coins and family power to pave the way to the door of victory. If she is willing to come up with two arachnids, Or the equivalent enchantment material, your chances of winning will be less than half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson was shocked and his face suddenly gloomy. What Minnie said was exactly what he was worried about, but the consequences of this incident were too serious, so he deliberately ignored the possibility. Now the Duke of Soram can say that he has done his best to support him. If he is reluctant, he will not take out two or three million gold coins too much. It is not enough for the value of one-third of the spider crystals. As soon as he thought of the precious dragon neck, Stevenson’s heart was bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you said, what should I do now?" Stevenson hesitated, and finally asked. He saw that Minnie had something to say, and even guessed Minnie’s thoughts, so she couldn’t quite look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple. You can't just do your own thing, but you must know what Richard is doing and get his design plan so that you can improve your plan in a targeted manner."<br />< Brd/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson smiled gloomyly, but still followed her words: "How can I know what Richard is doing? Will he tell me by himself?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini gathered up the scattered long hair and said, "I am going. I will deliberately go to him and ask him to take me. Richard is still a child." There is compassion, and he has just become a man, and as long as I can act like a few, he will probably be fooled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just became a man soon... "Sidwenson repeatedly recited this sentence in his mouth, carrying his hands and walking back and forth on the ground for a dozen or so times before standing in front of Minnie, staring at her eyes and slowly saying: "In order to act like Some, you will probably go to bed with him, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini admits: "Yes Will go to bed. If this is not the case, he will not trust me at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Warlock smirked and laughed: "Oh, you are willing to pay!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have already paid too much, we can't afford to lose!" Minnie's answer on the spot interrupted the laughter of the Dragon Warlock. He stared at Minnie and looked at it, and Minnie's eyes were clear and firm, and there was no evasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women are really strong animals..." Sidvinson muttered and stood up straight. He walked to the floor-to-ceiling window and silently looked at the ice floes under the night. There was a moon tonight, but under the light of the light, everything on the ground seemed darker. After a quarter of an hour, I slowly said: "Then go. But you have to remember the marriage contract between us. If you have his children first, and you plan to give birth, then the marriage contract between us. It will be invalid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the bottom line." Minnie said faintly. She stood up and walked behind Stevenson and said, "Give me another one. The slap in the face is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson Eyes open, staring at the sky of the sky, the bloody new moon, suddenly turned back round arms, backhand a slap in the face to fly Minnie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini's thin body was rotated a few laps in the air before being planted on the ground. The blood spewed from the corners of the mouth and nose, and the face swollen quickly, a bright red, drowning the original fingerprints. When she fell, her forehead knocked on the firm rocky ground, and the hot blood ran down the stream, quickly filling half of her cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini did not swear, but smiled, although the smile was very distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is enough," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Richard is still fighting in the world of formulas and numbers. The mountains and the sea stood by him, and stared at the dense figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when and how the mountains and the sea gradually participated in Richard’s magical design. She has an amazing talent for numbers and is more sensitive to the flow of magic, so she gradually keeps up with Richard's ideas. The mountains and the sea are still unfamiliar with the specific details of the magical structure, but she can proceed from the principle of the saint totem and give advice on many of Richard's ideas. Many times, Li’s eyes brightened and he suddenly discovered many new ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle and design of the magic pattern also fascinates the mountains and the sea, especially when Richard tells her principles and design ideas in a simple and precise language. Of course, another important reason is that if she participates, she can Justily stayed by Richard and enjoyed his taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the magic clock suddenly sounded, indicating that someone was outside the residential area and wanted to see Richard. Richard frowned, resisting the unhappiness of being interrupted, and quickly walked to the entrance and opened the door. Behind the door stood a girl who was wrapped in a cloak, and her face was hidden under the hood. Looking at the body data, Richard immediately matched her with Minnie, but it was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mini?" Richard tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl picked up the hood and smiled self-deprecatingly and said, "It’s rare that you can see that it is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was even more surprised, not because he guessed it accurately, but because Minnie had a severely deformed face and blood that was not completely wiped clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let me go in and sit?" Minnie said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...well, come in!" Richard has seen the tote bag carried by Minnie, the zipper is open, and it is loaded inside. Most of them are carry-on items and clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Minnie sat in the living room of the living area, and Richard brought a plate of fruit for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the mountains and the sea moved in, every day the gray dwarfs sent me 50 pots of fruit. The mountains and the sea originally wanted to pay a few more spider crystals, but they refused for the gray dwarves. All the services and food provided to the mountains and the sea, including tuition fees and various other expenses, are strictly implemented according to the standards. There is no such thing as a gold coin because of the invincible wealth of mountains and seas. Of course, mountains and sea otters It is not the same as the deep blue fee charged in the plan. Only the midsummer auction was an exception, because the bid is the freedom of the shooter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these details, you can also see the pride of dark blue. Although Su Hailun and the Grey Dwarf have a passionate enthusiasm for gold coins, they will not get a gold coin that should not be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf relies on providing perfect service to create revenue, while the legendary Master simply runs to the endless plane to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue for three years, Richard is also deeply influenced, so he still hesitated when he took out this valuable fruit, because this is Mountain and sea things. But beyond that, there is nothing he can do to entertain Minnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down opposite Minnie, and through the bright magical lights of the living room, he saw the injury on Minnie's face more clearly. This made Richard's heart twitch gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not what Richard thinks about Minnie, but a beautiful girl who is so beautiful, whoever looks at it will not be able to bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who did it?" Richard asked. Minnie said that he is also a pro-disciple of Su Hailun, and there are not many people who dare to beat her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie smiled bitterly: "It's Stevenson. But don't go to the law enforcement mage, because this is our...housework. I have been with him. There is a formal marriage contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stunned, then calmly looked at Minnie, directly asked the local: "Since it is a family matter between you, then I It's even more impossible to get involved. But if you come to me with your luggage, what's the idea? Do you think I will take you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
