			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oasis of dusk is the largest oasis in the desert area, The entire blood-staining place is also among the best. The two rivers that rushed down from the ancestral highlands gathered here to become a huge lake. If the fertile land around the oasis is fully developed, it can feed 100,000 people. This is a huge fortune. Where there is wealth, there will be bloodshed. The final result is that only a small piece of land around the oasis has been successfully developed. As for food, it is still necessary to rely on the caravans from the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the Blue Water Oasis, the oasis at dusk is also a mixture of forces that rule the land together. Unlike the blue water oasis, the power of the oasis at dusk is very fast, and has never formed a stable structure. Every time the forces change, it is naturally accompanied by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very normal night, a large fog rises from the lake, and then diffuses around the oasis and gradually spreads. The cities, settlements and camps along the oasis are shrouded in dense fog, and the lush vegetation is more serious. In some places, the visible distance is not even more than ten meters. In the oasis of dusk, such dense fog is almost every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dense fog, night, is a good weather for murder and arson. Therefore, there are frequent killings and arson in the oasis at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fog rises to its fullest extent, a tall black knight rides slowly out of the fog, a huge figure, a konjac underarm, And the huge blade, it looks like a demon! One after another, the black knights stepped out from the thick fog and arranged them into a row of horizontal arrays. Every knight is silent, and all kinds of heavy weapons point to the ground, and there is no other sound except for the occasional snoring of the nail collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two wizards walked out of the knight array and stood in front of the ride. They were all covered in the robe of the Master, and the hood was pulled up, and they could not see the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the dense fog suddenly collapsed into a hollow of 100 meters, and the huge dark lion fell from the sky, silently falling on the ride. In front of the array. As soon as it appeared, it immediately turned a few laps in an uneasy manner, and a low roar in the throat. So there was a small disturbance in the array of the town bear knights. The konjac that was closer to the lion lion was uneasily swaying, and even the knights could not suppress it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinkerel sitting across the neck of the lion slammed the head of the lion. The little fist fell, but with amazing power, slamming the head of the lion lion directly into the ground! It was not easy for the lion to pull out the big head. This time, it was quietly swaying and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the distant looming buildings in the fog, Sinclair’s breathing began to become sober, and his face gradually became abnormally flushed. Both wizards are familiar with her style and understand that this is a precursor to the breakout of Sinclair. So they began to sing the spell, and the group gain magic was cast out and blessed to each town bear knight. So these horrible beasts are equivalent to having an extra tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair is obviously biting his teeth, and his face is gradually distorted. It is very strange to appear on the small face of her doll-like beauty. It's like having two faces. She squeezed a question from her teeth: "You said, will the guys here listen to me slyly, no longer stupidly resist me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This kind of thing..." A mage carefully considered the words and said carefully: "It is difficult to avoid. You know, the idiots in the secondary plane will always be extraordinarily more."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair nodded hard, his eyes gradually became bloodshot, and finally the entire pupil became bright red! She suddenly pulled out the double knives and made a loud scream: "Take all the guys who dare to resist me! Offensive!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The famous town bear knights brought up weapons, instigated the konjac, and stepped forward. The process of their acceleration is very slow, the power is slowly flowing in the body, and each wave of tides pushes and stacks each other until it finally boils. Once they start charging, they are almost unstoppable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sinclair jumped up from the lion and slid in the air, wrapped in the whole body. So she was integrated into the night, and when she appeared again, she was already at the end of the oasis city. Ten meters in front of her, there is a team of fully armed and brave warriors patrolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" Sinclair screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a warrior was furious and yelled: "The old man is the person of the Jinhui battle flag! Where did you come from, the idiot..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his roar is only loud in the first half, the second half is getting smaller and smaller, and the last few words become empty and empty. He wants to bow, but he can't do this. The world in sight is spinning fast, and finally the darkness goes down. Sinclair has passed from the side of the team, the black cloak flutters in the night wind, and the wind on the edge of the cloak brings out the wind, but these winds are extremely sharp, and the heads of the patrols are easily Cut it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with these miscellaneous soldiers, Hinckler has no idea of ​​moving the knife. Her figure flashed on the street, and she went far away in the blink of an eye, hidden in the layers of buildings. Only wherever she appeared, in the twinkling of an eye, a large piece of blood mist will be sprayed, and the ground will flow into the stream. Not long after, the mist in the small half of the city was filled with blood and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has passed a huge black shadow, the lion lion silently fell to the center of the city, the front paws waved, directly facing the wall of a building in front Pulled down, revealing the room inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a barracks where more than a dozen escort soldiers are sleeping. Suddenly, half of the soldiers still did not wake up in their dreams, only two had time to jump out of bed. But they were greeted by a smog of lions ejected from the tail needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poisonous mist, if it has its own life, spreads throughout the room at an incredible speed, as if the water vapor in the confined space has not been let go of any corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore all the warriors swayed in place and solidified slowly in the last position. Their bodies are twitching uncontrollably, and the underside of the skin is constantly undulating, just like the boiling water inside the body. One by one is not very adult, it seems that the bones and flesh have all melted, becoming a large group of skins wrapped with boiling liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short sword hanging from the height of the room suddenly fell and was inserted into a person, just like a punctured water bag, suddenly squirting from the breach With a large dark liquid, the man quickly dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of hooves on the edge of the city sounded, the town bears then rushed into the town, and immediately set off bloody killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the town bear riders are all blood and broken limbs, the buildings on the oasis are in front of the heavy weapons of the knights, and they are as fragile as paper paste. Into. The violent town bear knights often stumbled over a house and buried it with the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
