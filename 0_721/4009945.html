This is a strong acid that is enough to corrode steel. The flesh and blood of the wind-toothed fur are quickly ablated. They fall from the lion's body and roll over the ground for a few more times. Then they don't move anymore, and then they turn into a pile of black. Remnants of the. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion lion that was poured in the acid was even more insane. It quickly smothered a few entanglements and then wanted to continue running. But just turned around, the mother's nest hit another mental shock, let it kneel in place, and then dozens of wind teeth jumped to the lion lion, simply suppress it with its own weight. After a few seconds, another thick acid was poured on the lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is quiet and no longer moves. Its acid has been spit out, and the two mental shocks have also exhausted all of the energy. The lion's body skin has been completely ablated, and the body shape is like a whole circle. It was weakly on the ground, and only the tail that broke the tail was still unconsciously flapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle on the castle is not over yet, there are still ten fierce town bear knights who are stubbornly killed, and below the castle, the surviving teeth are in Under the command of two elites, they fought against the konjac of the town bear knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the battle is coming to an end, Richard’s will is like a string that is tight to the limit, it seems to break at any moment, his vision is now clear, sometimes Blurred, the lungs are burning like fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire battlefield is filled with blood and blood. The sour gas and poisonous mist from the mother's nest are extremely difficult to disperse like this late night fog, and are still spreading around. A small part even began to affect the walls here. The walls of the gray and white rocks quietly appeared in a very dark black. On the top of the castle, the human warriors near this corner had a weaker body and had been breathing for a long time. Some people were kneeling. His own throat, screaming to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard bites his tongue and barely keeps himself awake, continuing to issue orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point in time, all the fighters have regarded Richard’s voice as an instinct to obey orders. With his dispatch, in the chaotic situation, the soldiers belonging to Richard are quietly retreating to the rear, while the elite soldiers of the Baron are still dying to the town bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the town bear knights have known that this campaign is difficult to escape, thus stimulating more fierce fierceness. The baron's warrior fell in pieces, and the people behind it immediately filled the gap and continued to push the devil-like enemy into the abyss of destruction in the way of life accumulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a meat grinder-like war of attrition, and it is also the most tragic moment when the battle is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha secretly sighs, but has to force himself to become cold and calm. In fact, his matchup at this time is very simple, that is, to evacuate his own people from the blade position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are occasional flashes of brilliance on the bodies of many barons, which are signs of blessings of divine power. However, the blessing of the sands has changed this time. The increase in the combat effectiveness of the soldiers is no different from the past, but it has an unprecedented incentive. All the blessed soldiers immediately have the courage to face all the powerful enemies. Even if they are in the 10,000, they also have the courage to charge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely the result of the study of the power of the courage of the sand, but it has other effects at this time. The soldiers who were blessed by the sand drifted only had the town bear knights in their eyes. They did not hesitate to put into the first-line battle like a meat grinder, and exchanged their own lives for a wound on the bears of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
