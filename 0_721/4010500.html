			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distant Faro, the drifting sand is lazy on the lounge chair Lazy to open the envelope, the letter paper is almost blank, only a short sentence to the extreme, the sand is on the spot, the hand involuntarily began to tremble, she brushed the letter over, and then turned back Just find another sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, then nothing is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand was stunned, and the letter paper slipped from her hands and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she suddenly jumped up and yelled angrily: "The mother's nest, what happened to the mother's nest, not to mention the mother's nest, it was a You are much more reliable than you, you liar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted out of the room, even the shoes were not put on, went straight to the conference room On the edge of the corridor, standing with a humanoid knight, is warning the whistle, the sand suddenly stopped in front of him, and he pulled him over, word by word: "Go and call me, immediately, Don't tell me that you don't know what is the brain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence of the sand-filled supplement is actually unnecessary. In the command sequence of the humanoid knight, the first one is Richard, the second is the mother's nest, the third is the sand, and the brain is placed after the sand. Of course, perhaps the order of the first and second is likely to change, and Richard is worried about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanoid knight stands like a sculpture, but has already passed the words of the sand to the brain. In the conference room, the sand is sitting in the window, that It is the place where Richard is used to sitting. The floor-to-ceiling windows actually have a great purpose. They are used for the meeting of Tiramisu. The ogre stands outside the building and attends the meeting on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the followers of Richard have long been scattered in the ancestral highlands, Gangde and Anrekala still shocked the human countries, and Anrekara is from time to time. The border of the Iron Triangle Empire was provoked everywhere, testing the reaction of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not wait in the conference room for a long time, and there was a gust of wind blowing out of the window, and the room immediately dimmed, and the huge body of the brain was already hung outside. On the wall, a small head was swept into the window. This brain was almost five meters long and was bigger than the ogre. It was exactly the look of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is swayed and it sounds human voice: "Beautiful Miss Sands, what do you want to ask me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is sweet and soft, The sound lines are clear and beautiful, and they are completely neutral and beautiful. There is no way to distinguish between men and women. No matter men or women, if they have such a voice, they are naturally fascinating. The problem is that this voice comes out of the brain. It makes people exceptionally awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, you are getting more and more disgusting." Flowing sand anger, now she is in a bad mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shape is not important. If necessary, I can also create a human shell for the brain, but Miss Liu, jumped the human skeleton, from the whole At the height of life, don't you think that this form of brain is very perfect?" The mother nest said euphemistically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghosts will feel that the nest, you give me a honest answer, if Richard is dead, what will happen to you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The master will die." The mother's nest was shocked, then silence for a moment, saying: "Are you asking about the impact on me? If the master is dead, then I will stay in the ninth order forever. I can't advance, I can continue to make a lot of combat units. Just give me enough time, I will turn the whole plane into my nest, but even if I become as big as a mountain, I am still a 9th order. , Stay here forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand fragile double eyebrows relaxed and asked: "Why."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I didn't have a soul, there was only one thing similar to the soul. The process of the master awakening me actually gave me part of the soul, which gave me an independent consciousness. Being able to think autonomously, if the owner dies, then no one can give me instructions for the promotion, I will Far from staying in the ninth order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is thoughtfully said: "I didn't expect it to be the reason. So, you are probably not natural. "The existence of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I think I was created to be used exclusively for weapons in the plane war." The nest answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand road: "No matter what you are, now you are a complete life, but your master, Richard, has encountered a big trouble, To be exact, this trouble is entirely his own, so I will return to Noland soon to see if I can do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hen’s nest immediately asked: “What do you need me to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is crisp and said: “First, with Gangde they control the situation of Faro, Prepare for war, second, create a avatar, in the form of seeds, and then give it to me, I may be useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem at all. "The hen promised it, and then said: "But I also have some private possessions. Please allow me to give them to you, maybe I can help a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has a little interest, ask: "Private, what is that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the three warriors I designed, it is my analysis The works of many races have been used to protect myself. But now, I think they are more meaningful to you. These three fighters, I call them the Big Three of the Night, respectively. Color, Hui Ye and Shura."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night of the Big Three, how do I seem to have heard of it? A. "Frowned flow of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I designed them, the term naturally appeared. It should be implanted into my memory when it was created. Another possibility is that I have communicated certain rules during my growth and have been affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of level are they, Sanctuary ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, according to the classification of Noland, they are now only seventeen, it is the limit I can create, and you can Only the twilight is taken away, and the night and Shura are not perfect. They spend most of the day in the nest. I need about a month to perfect them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one, not a sanctuary, then what are they special?" Flowing sand is not disappointing, but has some expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are flowing with the blood of the gods, all the bodies have the characteristics of the gods that are not dead, the soul is all born from the divine nature, naturally there is no The limitations of other combat units, all that humans can have, they have the same, they can learn, they can grow, they can think, and most importantly, they are not afraid of death. In addition, they have completely designed their body structure. If an enemy treats them with human eyes, then all the key points will be traps. If they die, I can recreate them immediately, as long as there is enough divinity and blood of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing sand as a god, sensitive to anything related to God, said faintly: "These two things can be difficult to find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faro There are a large number of local gods and gods, and there will always be divinity. As for the blood of the gods, as long as there are Zonghu, there will be as much as there are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, my time is very tight. When are you, the Big Three can come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The twilight has been recalled, only one day is enough. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will wait for your day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain left The window fluttered away, and the sand was sitting alone for a while, then opened the book of time, and there were two time hourglasses in the light. Inside were the images of Naiyou and IRu, and the sands said to the two hourglasses: "Let's come back, I have to go back to Noland. After I go back, I will never come back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou and Io are both exposed Surprised expression But they didn't say anything, just nodded. In an abandoned city in the ancestral highlands, Naiyou was holding a small statue to study. Io was searching around for something. They looked at each other, what? Did not say, and in the back, with the power of the gods condensed into wings, flying into the sky, quickly flew toward the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one day, a group of four people from the sands came out from the portal and appeared directly in the Temple of Eternal Dragon. Behind her, there were more than Nyi Iyo. A female warrior wrapped in a thin and exquisite armor, from the curve of the body, can be seen that this is a good woman, but the face is hidden under the metal mask. Surprisingly, this metal mask has no openings. I don't know if this woman is looking at the road ahead, or she is simply a blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands arranged for three people, and they went to find Vatican. The two generations of the gods closed the door of the temple and they had been secretly discussing for a long time. When they came out, Vatican looked serious and kept talking about what was going on with the sand. The sand was just shaking his head. They quickly entered the hall of sacrifice. Then a time light curtain fell, and the altar was isolated, and the gods and warriors were blocked. They are curious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the altar, the sand opens the book of time, and the gods inside pour out like water, infused into the altar, after the flow of sand, Vatican is finally sighing One voice, said: "Sand sand, I have told you the final outcome, but you still do not believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
