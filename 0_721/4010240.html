			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li is another arrogant, with a long knife in his hand toward Richard The direction of the imaginary knife, a blue-black knife mans immediately generated like a tide, when the head pressed to Richard. Richard tried his best to dodge, but he couldn't completely detach it. He was brought to the knees with a knife, and a bloody light appeared on his left arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he was injured after he came to Calondo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li once again held a long knife, roaring, one after another, like a sea rushing to Licha. And Richard's dodge is so ridiculous that it can't be flashed, and he will defend himself with instant magic, and then resist it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Baalibali was full of sorrow, even with a trace of respect, with the most serious attitude to face the opponent in front. It is only now that he fully understands the meaning of Richard’s all-out battle. The opposite of this is a magician or a swordsman or other professional teenager. With an incredible skill, even if the level is much lower than him, the combat power is Can be on an equal footing with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li has enabled his sacred ability, deep sea wrath. This <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is his ability to withstand the impact of the sea waves under the sea cliff day and night, in addition to the violent violent turmoil of the sea, but also let his body speed Balance of power and defense. It can be said that the Baalba force with the wrath of the deep sea, and the Baalibali without it are completely two opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard struggling in the raging waves is no longer cold, but burning crazy and wild! All his dodge and counterattacks are close to instinct, and wisdom and real talents have reached their limits, and every second consumes a huge amount of physical strength. And Richard's dodge posture is seemingly embarrassing, every time it is dangerous and dangerous to get rid of the madness, but the extinction, the elf long knife and the fate of the twins will always jump into his hands, still have the spare force to launch a counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the wrath of the deep sea, the counterattack of Richard is plain and urgency, just cut a knife, or an instant attack magic. However, after eating a four-level flame arrow, he was burnt out by the viscous flame that did not extinguish, and then saw the dark red knife on the long knife blade in the hand. At the time, he said that he would not be hard to pick up again, although his body is harder than steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-level lightning also appears from time to time. Every time you hit, Baaliba will stop moving, and at the same time, it will be burnt by the burning scent contained in the lightning. Then he will be cut by Richard's long knife burning with the prison fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, Baalibali will inspire fierceness, forcibly drive the body with the power of Pang Pei and firm will, no matter how much Richard has a knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, on the battlefield of the raging waves, lightning and knife light intertwined, blood is like silk, and the film unfolds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually felt his body numb, and Baalibali could no longer suppress the burning flame of the abyss in the depths of his body, and suddenly spurted a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just a few minutes of fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madness is abrupt, the two are separated and each falls to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibali can no longer stand, and has to put the knife in the ground to support the body. And Richard looked better than him. He was breathing on the fate of the twins. He took the book with the trembling hand, and the book page was opened, but the blood immediately smeared the pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard shook his book with force, and the magic flowed back from the book of the load to the magical armed forces, so the electric light flashed again and the body was straightened again. However, there are dozens of wounds in the body, and the deepest wounds can see the bones. So seriously injured, and then moved by the magical forces, blood immediately sprayed out of all wounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not hurt!" Baalibali said that in one sentence, the voice suddenly fell dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you better than me?" Richard retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal suddenly took a deep breath, a flush of redness on his face, and then spewed a cloud of blood. A blood spit out, and his spirit has become more vigorous. This is obviously the secret of some barbarians to stimulate their potential. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! I can hit you like a man as" Baal Baal growled, release the long knives, fists clenched, shaking Richard go go with. He decided to use his fist to let the little guy lie on the ground to wake up, even if the knife is gone, the body of Noland's magician is too brittle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sneered, and put the fate of the twins on the ground, and greeted Baalibali! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian warrior screamed and slammed into the face, but Richard took a step forward and leaned on his body, then Baalibali Suddenly vacated and flew up, and then I was covered by Richard, and squatted on the ground, and I was dizzy. Richard grabbed his hair and slammed his head to the ground, one, two, three...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground was pulled out The pit, the blood stained the red loess, and the gravel also turned into smaller pieces, but the cracking of the skull in the expectation of Richard never appeared. The bones of Baalibali are harder than Richard’s imagination. Like the strong man of this barbarian, his body and vitality are extremely powerful. Without breaking their bones, they are not called injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li suddenly screamed, his head slammed up, and the back of his head slammed into Richard's chin! Richard’s eyes were black in front of him, and he felt that his body flew out in a fluttering manner. It seemed to float in the air for a long time, and the back touched something hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard is on the verge of coma and ambiguity, but the second consciousness immediately took over the body, and the wisdom talent reminded Richard that time did not last long. . Richard was just hit and flew, and then fell to the ground. From the tremor perception of the ground, Baaliba is approaching and the speed is not fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lying on his back, only feeling that his body seemed to be evacuated. As for the injury, he is not hurting, the rest is just numbness and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extreme fatigue and emptiness made Richard's eyelids extremely heavy, making him want to let go of everything and sleep. However, as the consciousness gradually sank into the darkness, several pictures appeared quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Baalba Li, Richard lay on the ground a few steps away, blood continued to flow from the nose and mouth, and the chin was deformed. The youngsters that have been burning in the juvenile are almost extinguished, looking at the sky in a hollow, and the tight body is gradually relaxing. This is a sign that Richard is already in a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibal force dragged his heavy body toward Richard, he was going to stun Richard and achieve the final victory. Then he was ready to bring Richard back to the tribe, ask the witch doctor in the tribe to cure Richard, and then send him back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nolander is a true warrior and has earned the respect of Baalibali. Baalibali believes that at least in the will and courage, Richard really deserves to go up the mountain and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, Baalibali saw a small flame of a large bean on the finger of Richard. The color of the fire is dim red, but Baalibali has already experienced it. As long as it is the flame that Richard has released, no matter how big or small, it is best not to touch it. But when Li’s hand moves, it’s not to throw the flames to Baaliba, but to press on his lap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!!!" Richard suddenly sat up, his pain screaming like a beast!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flame with the power of the abyss has the power to erode the soul, and Richard has no protective force at this moment, and is burned by the flame, and immediately suffers the pain of burning the soul. It is not a pain that can be tolerated at all. It has nothing to do with whether the will is strong or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame finally extinguished and left a bright scorch on Richard's thigh. But Richard finally woke up from the coma and stood up with the last strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...and the last bit of strength. Let you see it...destroy!" Richard said intermittently, and it is possible to fall at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baliballi looked at the faint blue moon on the top of Richard’s head, and then a dark blue moon appeared on Richard’s body. Hua, the whole person actually fits into the Ba Li Ba Li! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is crazy!" Baalibali only had time to float on this idea, and he was slammed into the air by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When hitting the ground, Baalibali knew that he couldn’t climb again this time. Was it defeated by a 14th-level magician? It’s like dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took a few steps back and finally couldn’t help but spurt a blood and fell to the ground. In fact, he has already exhausted his magic and physical strength. He only has the secret sword of the fourth string of the blue moon. The smashing can barely lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword has always been the deepest sword of Richard’s comprehension. The reason is that when Gordon was teaching, the understanding of the destruction was far more than that. On top of the secret sword, Richard also learned the charm of this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balibali has been lying down, and Richard is still able to sit, this fierce battle has won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the two young people can only breathe vigorously, and they don’t even want to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, Richard suddenly sniffed and sniffed his face. I don't know when, the air began to fill up with a thick rancid smell, as if not far away, put a bunch of rotten meat that didn't know how many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bali Ba Li suddenly opened his eyes, his face appeared a deep taboo, suddenly called: "Black Usa!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far-reaching hoarse laughter, an extremely ugly, almost impossible to tell whether it is human or Warcraft barbarian sweating. He is still not close, and the rancid smell in the air suddenly becomes rich, making people feel vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Usa wiped the sweat on his head and smiled: "Although the road has worked hard, but now it looks just right. It is trouble late. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at Richard with a big, small eye, and his eyes were as green as barbaric. Black Usa suddenly licked his lips with the tongue of the front end, saying, "Are you the one who agreed? You heard that you are Richard? It’s amazing. Actually, you can knock down Baalibali. It seems that if Let you grow for another two years, I am afraid I am not your opponent, huh, huh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
