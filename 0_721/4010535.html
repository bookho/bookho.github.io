			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Grail in the hands of Richard does not know how many years have been placed on the altar, Perhaps it has existed since St. Louis was built. It has no special abilities and no special materials, but the sacred atmosphere contained therein is extremely rich. For the analysis of the rules of divine power, this holy grail is in other holy objects. On the other hand, it is difficult to compare the sacred scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to input strength into the Holy Grail, and the divine power in the Holy Grail immediately responded, turning into milky white smoke, lingering, and Richard’s eyes began to eject. Strong light, under the ability of insight, the smog of the sacred breath gradually enlarged, and finally there appeared a symbol of the gods, each running according to a certain trajectory, the god is also a language, different It is that each of its symbols has a unique attribute power. Under the same plane rule, the gods of the gods are similar. So far, Noland has already studied the symbols of the gods in depth, so I saw The vast majority of the esoteric observations are recognized, and a very small number of unclear recollections can also be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the complex is not the sacred symbols, but the trajectory of their operation, the real talent sees the truth of the rules, and the wisdom talent tries to carry out a lot of messy data. Analytical, the first step is to build a model for constructive analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the light in Li’s eyes is constantly ejecting, and it is getting more and more blazing. His whole body is beginning to radiate high heat, and his face is full of flushing. As with the fire, the light of the Holy Grail soon dimmed, and finally the sound was extinguished. Looking at the holy grail that the divine power had consumed, Richard shook his head and picked up another holy object. The short sword that a saint used to use, the short sword's divine spirit is less than half of the Holy Grail, and was quickly consumed by Richard's full stimulation and analysis, so Richard picked up another holy object. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the sacred objects in the storage room are rapidly reduced, and after a day and a night, the divinity of all sacred objects has disappeared, and Richard estimates that the process of analysis is only About one-tenth of the time, that is to say, if such a sacred object is to come back to the nine batches, Richard can construct a relatively perfect model, and then begin to officially solve the rules represented by the Glorious Lord. This is an extremely long process. From the results of the current analysis, the rule of the Glorious Lord is far above the tree of life, and perhaps the rules of detail should reach a million level, even higher, and life. The rules of the tree are only 65,536. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the broken sacred house, Richard began to seriously think about Martin's agreement. Martin has a method of condensing the crystallization of divinity from the sacred instrument. Such a sacred device can condense the divinity of ten units, and Richard estimates cooperation. If you are established, you must at least take out about 14 or so divine crystals. After deducting the two units that Richard can get, you need to pay for the complete analytical model. The divine crystallization of the unit, this is the minimum requirement, and the main way for Richard to obtain the crystallization of divinity is to sacrifice, or to exchange with other people in a structure, a top sacrifice, about 50 units can be exchanged. The crystallization of divinity, that is to say, if Richard wants to perfect the model, he will have to pay the price of two top sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not cheap, but it's affordable." Richard thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately called a waiter and asked him to send a credit remote magic transmission to the Shenghui Great Temple, indicating that Martin had kissed him. There is no content, only one number, 14, Martin can definitely understand what it means. After doing this, Richard’s eyes fell on the only thing that has a divine atmosphere. More than 20 centimeters, nearly half a meter long, its cover is inlaid with bronze, the surface is an ancient symbol of ambiguity. It is certain that this symbol has nothing to do with the Church of St. Hui, so this holy scripture should It was the church that did not know where it was obtained, and it was changed to the style of the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened the Holy Scriptures, revealing pages that had become thick yellow under the influence of the years, and the pages were written in beautiful fonts on the pages of the book. Under the circumstance, the years and the sacred will come to the surface, but under the insight, Richard saw that the time of copying the holy script is not consistent with the pages of the book. Although the handwriting is also very historical, the pages are old and old. Much more, Richard turned over again, and saw no scars and no traces of tears in the Holy Scriptures, but when it was hard on that day, Richard saw that the pages that Martin had turned over burned one by one. It seems that this holy book does have a divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha flipped, suddenly stopped on one of the pages, this is a blank page, originally ordinary, but it is mixed It is quite unusual to write a page full of holy scriptures. When Richard thought about it, he closed the holy scripture, and when his mind turned and opened the holy scripture, he saw the blank page directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blank page looks just slightly lighter than the other pages, but touches it, but there is a vague force flowing, this page gives Richard’s Feeling very familiar, his book of books, and the book of the sands of time have such pages, but the nature of power is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li tried to input the power of various attributes into the page, there was no reaction at the beginning of the page, but when Richard began to mobilize the power of Archimonde, the page suddenly reacted, and the page glowed like a magma. After a few moments of rotation, it began to condense into a demon image. This is a common demon that is very common in the abyss. It has dark red rough skin, two and a half meters long corners, and a rough heavy hammer in the hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon image is very vague, but it has established a connection with Richard. If Richard feels that he continues to input power, he might take it from The book page is pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha dissipated the power, the devil snarled unwillingly, slowly disappearing, but the power of Richard’s original input was absorbed by the pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the call of the page be related to the power of the blood." Richard thought, began to mobilize the power of the tree of the world, this page shows a blur Unclear light green, it seems that there is something to be formed, but how can it not condense, and then try the elements, the natural world tree is also the same, and when the power of the tree of life is activated, the page's reaction is obviously large A lot, it actually outlines an elf, but this time the cohesion still failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then understood that this is his blood power is not strong enough to create a complete summoning life in the book page, Richard began to activate the magic Star World Tree, this is his only world tree that was promoted to the fifth order. This time the page responded much faster, and soon there was an image of an elf prophet. Richard did not give up this time, but continued to strengthen his power. Even after the activation of the real name Saronic power, once the real name was activated, the image of the elf prophet changed accordingly. He began to become old, and his robe was obviously more gorgeous, and he also had a high crown on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from the image point of view, the Elf prophet has become more powerful, and even the equipment has changed. Once the elf prophet is summoned, it is the seventeenth level. In all kinds of battles, he will be a powerful boost, and his power is obviously derived from Richard's real name, so if it is Dissmasen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glimmer of expectation, Richard mobilized this first-ever, but also mysterious, real-name power. He was curious and didn’t know what it would bring to destroy his real name. Summon creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little black in the page, and then spread like the ink quickly, occupying the entire page, it was a tumultuous darkness, and it continued to pass from the depths. It was a horrible horror, and then in the deepest darkness, there was a low-pitched glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
