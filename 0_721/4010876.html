To supplement, because the production of the Church of Light is so much in a period of time, it has been divided up by the various forces at an early stage. If Richard is not a sacred architect, he will not be able to get so many gods. What's worse, because the magical armed forces used the sacred core, they must use the god Mu Wujin, and ordinary Wujin is no longer good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already anger in Richard’s face, and such an important core material will go wrong, and I don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the director in charge of managing materials walked into the study, he saw that Richard’s face was yīn, and he was constantly tapping the table with his fingers, every tapping, It’s like playing in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods Mujin should have been lying in my warehouse, now, where is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor is a 16th-level mage, but at the moment, in front of Richard, he feels that his legs are weak, and even his body is very difficult. The legendary strongman is already able to control the existence of the rules. Richard holds many rules, and his anger naturally affects the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor said as quickly and succinctly as possible: "His Highness, things are like this, these gods are jīng gold, and a number of weapons armor are escorted by the church knight, They were responsible for serving the Yashan collar, but in the border area of ​​the sacred dynasty, they were suddenly attacked, the whole army was annihilated, and all the goods and materials carried were looted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s pupil shrinks and asks coldly: “Who did it.” Someone dared to attack the church knight on the site of the Holy Tree Dynasty and kill all the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is said that a group of mercenaries named the Eagle of the Red Eagle, they started very embarrassed, and fifty church knights did not escape." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard reveals an elegance, but makes the supervisor feel a creepy smile: "Since you know who you started, how do you do it?" Of course, how does the Red Eagle Feather know that these church knights are escorting God Mu Wujin? This issue can be discussed later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time I got the news, I immediately sent someone to find the lord of the area, the Marquis of Brahms of the Holy Tree Dynasty, and asked him to investigate the matter. In addition, I also reported this to the Count of Ellie." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard’s face was slightly gentler, saying: “The Marquis of Brahms heard that this person is a bit difficult, then the result of the investigation.” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor has difficulty in saying, "This is the case, His Royal Highness, the location of the accident is still in the territory of the Holy Tree Dynasty, and the other party is also a church person. Strictly speaking, the Guangming Church has not completed the delivery of the goods, and the goods are not considered to be our assets, so we have no reason to intervene and only ask the local lords to assist in the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard picked up his eyebrows and signaled the supervisor to continue, but there was a vague idea in his heart that began to take shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I have sent people to the Great Shrine of the Church of Light to negotiate this matter. By convention, the Church of Light should re-deliver or compensate." When the supervisor finished, he couldn’t help but wipe his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-delivery." Richard sneered and said slowly: "Wait until the new church of the Guangming Church, Wu Mujin, at least one year later. After that, I can't wait a year, and the results of the investigation are going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a news coming back." The supervisor said carefully. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a magic ring on his wrist suddenly flashed a few times. This is a signal for him to find him, and it is an important matter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has perceived that a mage is standing outside the study room, and when he waved his hand, he said, "Whatever, listen first."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor pushed the door out and returned to the study after a while, his face singularly said: "The Marquis of Brahms has just heard the news, he has found the Red Eagle Yu’s lair, and all the infamous mercenaries, found the equipment that was robbed in the mercenary camp, but there was no god Mujin, no one gram.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Richard’s fingers tapped the desk just as gently, but this time, the entire desk suddenly shattered and turned into a sawdust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked calmly out of his hand, and the supervisor immediately handed over the information he had just received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter from the Earl of Brahms, the wording is polite, the statement is concise, and the letter is accompanied by a long list of the red The materials seized in the Eagle's Feather Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of equipment was not lost, God Mu Wujin one gram did not, and the red eagle feather did not leave a live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor was extremely upset and felt that the chest was like a stone. This letter he had seen, in the gentle and courteous wording, he saw arrogance. The ultimate arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was gently placed on the table by Richard, gentle as a love letter to the lover, the table has been completely shattered, but the letter is suspended in the air, together with the original The files placed on the desktop are like the support of a solid desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the control of terror, the effect of pure magic, in the eyes of the master of this great magician, has become a magical skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Master is so powerful that he does not need to show through the magic of destroying the earth, sometimes one or two details are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie gently tapped the letter, just as he had beaten the table before, and also made a crisp squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unspeakable silence, Richard suddenly said: "It was the Red Eagle's feather that attacked our caravan. This news is also what Brahms told. Yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee gently waved And said, "Okay, it's okay, you go down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor finally sighed and quit the room, and when he closed the door, he saw the blue The fire ignited, silently burning the letter and the broken desk, and the documents that were not reviewed were all unscathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor involuntarily fought a chill, hurriedly closed the door and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard stood in front of the ultra-remote communication magic array, entered a special set of positioning codes, and the magic array lit up, which appeared in Saint Martin. That handsome and always smiling face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Richard, what is so urgent, you need to find me in this way. This kind of communication is very expensive. It costs 100,000 gold coins every minute. You can't just use it because I pay." There is no surplus in the house of the Son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some headaches interrupting St. Martin’s words, otherwise he has no idea how long it will last, with one Minutes of 100,000 gold coins in the communication law circle to chat, it seems that this St. Martin's family not only has surplus food, but also a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martin, how much is God Mu Wujin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin made an exaggeration Expression, said: "How much, my dear Richard, do you think it is cold iron? To be honest, I have already handed over my quota for the last five years, and now I have a gram of God in the church. Mu Wujin did not, if you want, wait for next year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These gods Mu Wujin, were robbed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin was shocked and jokes. He knows what it means for a holy builder. What kind of auxiliary material is not the core, but it is indispensable, especially Temporary search for alternatives is extremely cumbersome for some special configurations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and asked: "I have been suppressing heresy in the ridiculous plateau during this time. The news is relatively closed, and I figure out who did it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened on the territory of the Marquis of Brahms"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee simply said something in a few words Once again, St. Martin immediately sniffed the taste, frowning: "This practice is too much"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee reveals a sardonic smile, saying "Yeah, it's too obvious. It's like I'm afraid I don't know who did it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin is thinking from another angle: "But his approach is flawless, at least in line with all the rules, and his attitude is impeccable, at least on the surface. Of course, this is also a provocation. We all know this."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What advice do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin smiled bitterly: "If you ask my suggestion, you must have had an idea. I have to ask my suggestion. I can only say that this Marquis of Brahms is not low. It is the nephew of the current archbishop of the church. This time, I am afraid I will be more directed at me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop of the Cardinal Mission seems to be a position second only to the Pope."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Cardinal Lufei De Archbishop, he and the Chinese Archbishop are in the same position, but their personal strength is slightly weaker than the Chinese Archbishop, but the difference is not too much, at least It’s much better than me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled lightly and said, “It’s a big man”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;St. Martin once again smiled bitterly: "In front of your genius sect, in addition to those super strong, there are still big men, you should not dig me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at the sky, gently spit out a breath and said: "Whether they are against you, but this time it really I am also implicated in it, huh, I want to make it impossible for me to make a fifth-order structure in a year. This is jǐng."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin has heard of Lee Look at the abnormality of the breath, the tip of the nose begins to sweat: "The impact of this incident on you, not so serious, millions of small money, they are still very measured, just do not want you to help me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He revealed some strange smiles and said, "It’s not money, it’s time, I need to get something to keep my little son’s life. In order to get it, I need to make a holy costume, which will make my chance of success change from 50% to 80%. Waiting for the previous year, my little son will probably die seven or eight times. You said, this The matter is not serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s face changed, Shen Shen said: “It’s like this, you give me a few days, I go back to the holy city. Looking for the Pope, the Pope must have some private collections of God Mu Wujin. In addition, I will send people to find Brahms and let him put the batch. God Mu Wujin spit it out, but it may take some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his eyebrows and said: "You are preparing for the war with the Pope. Are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Thanks to the new ally, Lao Chu 1977. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
