The eyes are incomparably complex, and all the modified mountains and seas are removed, which is pure and clean beauty, just like the land and mountains of Calando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally washed the saint totem." The elders had some ease in their voices, but they were somewhat lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, now you can rest assured, you can continue to preach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Elder I took a deep breath and thought about it, saying: "Mountain and the sea, this matter is of great significance to us throughout Calando. If the heavenly armed forces are combined with the saint totem, it will produce a super strong and powerful. His power may be in the forefront of the entire era of Calando. The existence of such a strong person will be a great counterweight, allowing the Nolanders to continue to look elsewhere. Go, instead of peeping at us, Calando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea smiled and asked: "The army won't win Noland, how can the strong be also Is it better than that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders passed a trace of unnaturalness and said: "In terms of the real strong, our two sides have always maintained a balance of power, However, in recent decades, Noland’s legendary powerhouse has increased more and more, and it is getting faster and faster. If you continue this way, you will not be able to use it for a hundred years. Our balance of power in the strong will also be completely lost. Calando is different from the Green Continent. We are much closer to Noland. As long as they are willing to pay a huge price, they can always send the army to Calando. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father, I still scared you." Shan and Hailuo said with sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." The elders admitted admitly. "If you didn't have your father's expedition, we wouldn't realize our problems. The Millennium Empire is a country. The expeditionary army almost hit the foot of the snow-capped mountains. If the three major human empire of Noland is mobilized at the same time, we can't resist it anyway. The difference in the number of fighters is too great. The population of Noland is our dozens. Times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you have more of this superpower, you can keep it safe for decades. Then, think of a super strong person." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of mountains and seas made the elders unable to answer. Only the smiles. Finally, the mountains and the sea also sighed and said: "In the end, such superpowers will definitely become the elders of the Presbyterian Church. Now I even have me. If you don't want to hear from you, you will be sure that he can accept all your orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders are stubborn: "That is the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the platform of the snowy mountainside, Richard suddenly opened his eyes, he felt a hidden wave sweeping over himself, this feeling and the barbarians The people are quite different. They are not the kind of rough and violent taste. Instead, they have a delicate and exquisite feeling. The mistake is not that Richard has been fighting in the field for many years. Now the perception is far beyond the normal big magician. I don’t know anyone already. I have tested myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of Li’s mouth reveals a faint sneer, converging the red awn on the index finger, holding the barbaric slaughter, and going out of the camp, now even the legendary strongman He also has the ability to fight a fight. In the land of Calando, if there is a provocation, you must take it back. Otherwise, there will be wolves coming to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But looking at it, everything is as usual in the night, there is no abnormal place, the fluctuations of the scan have disappeared, and Richard even finds To any clues, he stood for a moment, then shook his head, re-drilled back to his camp, continued to rest, and tempered his skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where Richard saw, a middle-aged man appeared quietly. He has a delicate beard, full of the charm of a mature man, when he was young. Presumably, it is even more radiant. Although he is a human being, his appearance does not lose with the elves, but he also has the masculine charm that the elves do not have. He actually stands in the darkness, but he can let Li Cha’s disappear and watch Richard return. Camp, he finally nodded, showing a smile, and then disappeared silently as he came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the temple, there is a long stone house, which is where the people of the temple are living. At this moment, in one of the obviously more elaborate small courtyards, it is breaking out. Intense quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mountain and the sea, this is for the overall situation of Calando." A beautiful woman said while walking back and forth in the room, it seems agitated . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man leaned against the wall, surrounded by arms, and sneered and said: "For the sake of the big picture, that's good, then why not pay for your elders, but must be my daughter, I think your efforts are more effective. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't we give it?" The woman angered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not." The man is not angry at all, but calmly said: "As long as each of your elders has dragged the Nolan strong together The courage of suicide, things will not be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman immediately stunned, only after a while said: "But... the strongest of Noland is getting more and more Many, even if we are willing to sacrifice the death battle, the result of the consumption will only be more and more unfavorable to Calando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a super strong What can you do? After a few decades, the gap is not big enough to make up for it. At that time, you have no chance to fight hard, and when the Noord army arrives, it will even smooth out your Snow Mountain Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman raised her voice: "But can you fight for decades, isn’t it better than no time? Things will always turn."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more excited the woman’s emotions, the more calm the man is, even the smile that is full of mature man’s charm, not sick Xu said: "Transfer, as long as you are still in power, you can't have any turnarounds. What you haven't done in the past 100 years, and giving you decades, will only make things worse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman suddenly stood, looked at the man's eyes and said seriously: "Godhawk, I know the heart of the mountains and the sea, I don't want my own This is the daughter, but this is the decision of the entire Presbyterian Church. We have no way to refuse the conditions proposed by the Holy Tree Dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled and said, "I Which of the elders you want to do is to die, it is to die or to live, anyway, my daughter can not become a victim, for the overall situation, I can listen to this kind of words, huh, huh, don’t forget, politics, Nolander has been ahead of you for thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s face flashed a sigh and sighed: "Sorry, but this matter can’t be changed. I can't do anything, you can't do anything more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man still smiled calmly and pointed to his head and said: "The problem does not necessarily need to rely on force. More often, it depends on it. This matter is still far from the dust. Moment, yes, by the way, remind you that Wu Sheng Tibetan sword should have been on the way to Calando. At his speed, he should go to the temple three days later."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman's face changed and said: "Tibetan sword, how could he suddenly come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He owes me a Human sentiment, so since I called him, he certainly wants to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman’s face has changed dramatically: "You have a way to contact him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiles more and more fascinatingly: "There are many mysteries in the magical world. It’s no big deal to contact them occasionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman gradually calmed down and said, "Even if the sword is coming, it will not change anything. I can stop him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can, but you only have one person. I don't believe that Richard did not write a letter to the emperor of the Holy Alliance before he came to Calando. I heard that the guy in Philip could not handle it. Oh, yes, Richard also has a teacher, Su Hailun, the woman who heard that even the Tibetan sword is not willing to provoke, whether it is fat Philip or Su Hailun, as long as there is a person to intervene, you have to think about it. Of course, it is not enough to keep the sword. It is not enough for the Holy Alliance. But if our two parties are united, do you dare to go it alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman's face changes It’s cold and says, “You are threatening me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, because you want to take my daughter as a victim, I don’t feel threatened you have What is too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman suddenly disappeared with anger, calmly said: "You should know that the temple is never threatened, doing so will only make things It gets worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want If you want the elders to give in, but want a fair chance, let the holy scriptures be what it should be. No one should intervene in the back. Isn't that good?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked at the goshawk's eyes and said, "You seem to have confidence in Richard. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
