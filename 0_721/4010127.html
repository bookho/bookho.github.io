			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s vision is very accurate, and the enchanting equipment of Faro’s is true. The high quality of the goods is also the most profitable part. The enchanted sword that can be bought from Noland's 1,500 gold coins, Faro's cost is at least 3,000 or more, and such a high cost does not guarantee stable and large supply. Moreover, the number of Li’s launches was too large, and hundreds of high-quality equipment sold eventually caught the attention of the Masters Association. After a little tracing, the sources of the newly added sophisticated equipment were found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that Richard touched the core interests of the Masters Association, so there will be a large number of Masters to find the way to come. The Masters Association of the Sequoia Kingdom first considered maintaining the status quo, followed by the inclusion of Richard in the system of the Masters Association. In other words, it is in the best interest of the Masters Association to completely eliminate the variable of Richard. As for the part of the equipment that Richard has already taken out, of course, it must be owned by the association. What the Masters Association hopes is that there will be no more similar sophisticated equipment in the future. Only in this way can the Masters Association maintain the high price of sophisticated magical equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Kalimie has made such harsh conditions. If Richard bows his head, it will become the hard work of the Masters Association. If you don't bow, give the Masters Association an excuse to destroy him. As for the teacher behind Richard, the Masters Association with eleven Magisters does not think that they need to fear any single Master. Of course, the big magician here is based on the standard of the Faro plane, not the 18th level of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard can never give up the high profits of the enchanting equipment, the standard weapon armor is just the beginning, the real precious is the non-standard epic, even the legendary level equipment. These can all sell a high price in Faro, so that Richard can exchange for more resources, and then in Norland exchange resources for wealth and transform into their own power. This is the root of Richard’s growing strength and the source of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a fundamental conflict of interest between Richard and the Masters Association, either being swallowed or destroyed, without the slightest reconciliation and compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Richard released the Kalimi people back was just to avoid the immediate war with the Masters Association and delay the time. Moreover, the Master's Association Golden Robe and Silver Robe Masters are weak, and there is not much threat to put them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army that followed the second Western Expedition of Li has a total of 15,000 people, of which there are 5,000 soldiers belonging to Richard, most of which are ground meat in the oasis The slave warrior transferred from the machine. In addition to one hundred and fifty junior knights, there are more than 200 surviving humanoid warriors and only one hundred and fifty others. In the battle of the meat grinder, the loss of the Brood Warrior was also very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only good news is that Twilight was promoted to the 10th level in the four days of fighting. There are also signs of faint promotion. Only Richard is still some distance away from the magic of the thirteenth level, but a large number of stars are added to the main star of the magic star, so that the existing two branches produce a dozen leaves with light blue stars. The two abilities of the Magic Star have been enhanced. Every time there is a meditation, there are more than a dozen stars flying around Licha, and the effect is that the frequency of the second-order starburst of the two or three times of the common star is greatly increased. Richard can't catch it. In addition, Richard found that his body has been able to absorb free energy from the surrounding and transform it into magic power, thereby increasing the speed of magic recovery. Therefore, Richard's magic recovery speed is now double that of a normal mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now on the trunk of the magic star, there is a third branch to grow. Richard is very much looking forward to the upcoming new capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the golden robes and silver robe mage of the Masters Association, Richard actually found nearly a hundred magic crystals! In the human kingdom, this is a huge wealth of 500,000. These magic crystals were sent to the mother's nest by Richard. Now, if the sixth-order mother's nest needs to add an additional combat unit to create the ability, it needs to absorb 60 magic crystals, and it can only be improved once. The remaining forty magic crystals will become the energy reserve of the hen's nest and begin to evolve in relation to the direction of the magic. This is a huge investment. According to the calculation of the mother's nest, it is necessary to invest more than one thousand magic crystals to create a magical combat unit. Now Richard has no money to invest in the magic direction, he is trying to strengthen the rank of the hen itself and the number of combat units created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest and the war are the two monsters that devour the gold coins, and the appetite is always filled with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After strengthening, the number of knights that the mother's nest can produce per day has increased to four, the number of humanoid fighters has increased to eight, and the throwing soldiers can produce nine, and the wind teeth It is eleven. Of course, you can only choose one of them every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Western Expedition, Richard asked the mother's nest to fully produce the knight, but left all the knights in a turbulent place, and then called the knights after he returned. . In the second half of the line plan, Richard felt that relying on the existing strength is enough. Although the newly recruited troops, the army of the Count of Latour and the Countess of Ekaterina did not agree with the authority of Richard, but the Count of Latour had a crush on Him, and Richard did not worry. The army of Countess Ekaterina, Richard only took the most elite thousand. Only the leading general of this unit, Ms. Anna, made Richard have some headaches. The lady is beautiful and proud, and her 14th-level strength makes her seem confident and disregarded by any man. Richard was very worried about whether she would fully obey the command in the coming war, so she simply reduced the countess's troops to the lowest proportion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Anna’s purpose is not to participate in the Western Expedition, but to stare at Viscount Heim, so there is no objection to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop of the second half of the line is the Camp Noon Camp. Canovenson is the distribution center and base camp of various barbarian tribes, similar to the national capital of the human kingdom. In this camp that occupies more than a dozen square kilometers, you can find dozens of races, such as Tauren, Orc, Ogre, Giant Demon, Grey Dwarf, Evil Gnomes, Cavemen and even Goblin and Nari. Hundreds of tribes. There is no shortage of contradictions among all races and tribes, and even a bloody relationship, so conflicts and killings continue. In the camp of Canovenson, you can see battles, groups of Europe and even killings every day. It is also a concentration camp for non-human tribes. If a tribe warrior pulls out the camp, it will quickly turn into a robber team. They are naturally hostile to the human slaves, and if any human caravan passes through the camp, it becomes a carnival for each tribe. Dozens of races will be temporarily joined together to completely kill the human caravan. The goods of the caravan are worth a lot, and even the human beings are good rations for many of the tribes of Canovenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, in addition to the first-class caravans with more than a thousand guards, no human caravans dare to approach Canovenson, they would rather wind Hundreds of kilometers, not wanting to be eyed by the tribes here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Richard’s army is directed to Canovenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano Vinson’s various races came out, and all the adults who could fight were turned into warriors, and eventually a team of more than 40,000 people was assembled. A battle with Richard’s troops in the gravel Gobi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a no-frills positive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
