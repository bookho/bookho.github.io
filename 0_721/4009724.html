			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a small episode, it was soon the day of the Midsummer Carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue inside and outside the carnival atmosphere, many people wear their own ethnic exaggerated and bright costumes, with colorful wigs, even on the face to depict the form Different patterns. The vats of wine are transported into the dark blue area by carriage, and then become empty barrels at an alarming rate. Dark blue lights up again, and countless fireworks decorate the night sky into a colorful fantasy world. There is a bonfire of bonfires, songs and food everywhere. On this day, it seems that there is no sorrow in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the upper level of the deep blue main tower, the real powers are still very clear. Because the real auction is being held here, the private collection of the legendary mage is also fully exposed. This is an amazing event. The legendary Master has a lot of things, the rarity of the property, far more than the previous Midsummer Carnival, and once again, the great aristocrats present have a new understanding of Su Hailun's strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing is undoubtedly the complete dragon in the center of the hall. Several magicians are chasing around it, and the mouth-watering appearance is directly exposed. Their identity. But the most precious thing is not the dragon owl, the heart of an ancient beast that is displayed in the wilderness of the highest place, the armor of the abyss of the abyss, and the full neck soft skin of a fire dragon. Millions of rare items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of the auction are very simple. Each brand has a brand in front of it, and the person who intends to buy writes the price and identity that he is prepared for. If there is a higher bid, continue writing in the up column. No one will bid until the end of the auction. Of course, if someone needs a particular item and can't wait for the auction to end, he can open the price to the audience. If no one is competing, then this thing is his. Although the entire auction hall area has reached an astonishing 13,000 square meters, it is enough to have only 10 level fighters to achieve the sound. The great aristocrats who can enter this auction hall, even if they do not have this strength, the number of ten-level fighters must be hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real powers of the territories are most interested in the magic materials such as the dragon dragon skin, which attracts them on the four-layer circular table on the west side of the hall. A piece of ore sample. For the aristocrats who can be deployed with private armaments, the role of the dragon's dragon skin is far less important than the few tons or even hundreds of kilograms of rare metals. The former is nothing more than one or two precious magic props, while the latter means the magic armor, heavy weapons and enchanted arrows of the established units. Together with the right fighters, an army is formed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful people are somewhat disgusted with the power of individual force, but they are extremely enthusiastic about building a large-scale army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s certainly not possible to have all of these large ore mines piled up in the exhibition hall, so just put a few samples. Deep blue has always been reputable in terms of supply. Whether it is through auction or daily sales channels, the quality of samples and bulk ore is almost the same. The great aristocrats gathered in front of the booth in groups of three and five, studying the color of the ore. The well-connected families will whisper each other and use the corners of their eyes to look at family representatives who are not their own allies. They will read the description of the goods carefully. In addition to the quality, the quantity is also one of the focuses of attention. After careful calculation and repeated scrutiny, they carefully wrote down the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the hall was warm but modest, and it was still early from dawn. It was only undercurrent, not when the bayonet was red. However, it is clearly beyond the quantity and quality of the auction items that everyone expected, and it still ignited the faint smell of gunpowder. In particular, the number and types of large ore accidents are so many that people can't help wondering how many rich minerals have been captured by legendary mages in the past few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevenson was not dazzled by the rich exhibits in the hall. He maintained an elegant and demeanor, and a few of his allies' families shouted a few words, and he walked into the exhibition area of ​​the dragons. Behind him, in addition to the original comrades and divine masters, the Duke of Soram sent two senior appraisers, as well as two high-ranking fighters above the 16th level. There are very few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many days of good communication with the Black Gold assistant, Stevenson had long been a goal that must be won, that is, the dragon neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! It is the legendary fire dragon! Not a red dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon has not been easy. The red dragon has the strongest body in the five-color dragon, and the fire dragon is actually a branch of the red dragon. The number is very rare, but the strength is far stronger than the red dragon. If the red dragon that has lived for thousands of years is extremely powerful, then it will be promoted to a dragon in an accidental situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to compare with the power level of the human powerhouse, for example, the Duke of Soram, he has just entered the legend, fighting with adult fire dragons only in life Between two. The team of knights led by Santa Cruz will be directly leveled. Therefore, the Soram family has to rely on its own force to get the complete fire neck skin, the possibility is almost zero. For this reason, Santa Cruz has developed a fire-based magic pattern based on the dragon skin, which has the best overall effect, but was the first to be rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson stood on the side of the sign for a long time, carefully studying the instructions that were densely packed with even a few illustrations, and each word was not missed. Only by visual inspection, this skin is better than expected, much larger than the average dragon skin, intact, the fire dragon is also the old dragon of thousands of years, so the quality of the neck skin is far from alive. A hundred years of little red dragons can rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the statement on the card, the first paragraph is to introduce the legendary Master how to fight the heroic deeds of the dragon. This is something that can be skipped as usual. After three times of historians, masters, and black gold, whoever wants to guess the skills of the legendary wizard is destined for tragedy. The second paragraph is very important. This part is the data and combat effectiveness of the fire dragon. According to the convention, the deep blue reputation can guarantee the accuracy of these descriptions. The last paragraph is equally important, and is an environmental description of the habitat of the fire dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction record already has two lines of small characters, the bid is 1 million and 10.5 million gold coins respectively, and the paying should be two individual strong. Individual powers without power support are stronger, and strength and financial resources are hard to compare with big aristocrats such as Soram. Of course, Su Hailun is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the detailed description of the expert, Stevenson tried to keep his facial expression calm, but his eyes could not be slightly twitched. This fire dragon neck skin is too important for him. With it, Santa Cruz can produce a powerful second-order magic pattern. At that time, the snow rabbit defeating the winter wolf will no longer be a legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this fire dragon neck, Stevenson is like seeing the door to the Dragon Guard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned and asked the man to pass the magic pen, ready to write the first amount. After thinking about it, Stevenson decided to set the price at 1.3 million and then 200,000. This can not only show strength and determination, but also not excessively publicized, so as not to be seen by people with ulterior motives, and deliberately participate in it, artificially raise prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the halls of the gradually noisy silence suddenly, almost all the strongmen over the 18th order turned around at the same time, looking to the entrance of the hall. An invisible and blazing wind poured in from the entrance of the hall, and instantly filled the entire hall. The temperature in the hall suddenly rose several degrees. The warm and humid climate suddenly became dry and hot, and the air was filled with the smell of desolateness. Many people even heard the roar of the faint beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
