			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master is also a master of erudition. She has identified hundreds of different species from the forests of Green Forest. Several of these trees are worth a lot in Noland, and Master Long has been cutting down the trees and transporting them back to Noland for military spending to maintain the consumption of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Lina’s introduction to the tree species, Richard asked: “What is the difference between the local indigenous people?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina said: "So far, we have found only one kind of intelligent life. Of course, they are internally distinguished by tribes. After many experiments, I found them and Noland. The forested elves and the wild elves have many similarities, but they are not exactly the same. Come with me, I will show you something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow Lina and walk to the basement of the Lord's Castle. The guards were deployed everywhere along the way, and they were very rigorous. There is a prison in the underground space of the Lord's Castle, which only holds the most important prisoners. In addition, Lina’s own magic laboratory is also here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina first took Richard into the deep prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 20 cells, which are filled with prisoners, all of which are indigenous, different ages, ages, and tribes. But except for the indigenous elves on the front of the cells, wearing all the clothes, all the indigenous elves in the back of the cell, regardless of men, women and children, are loyal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li’s eyes swept away, he saw many of them showing signs of torture and abuse. Two young and beautiful elf women were somewhat confused. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect your taste to be quite heavy." Richard said faintly, but did not blame anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of the things here are left by Bear Peter. It’s actually a complete set of experimental systems. Then you can see it." Lina said. And led Richard to the end of the cell, opened an iron gate, revealing a wide space behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark, strange and bloody place. A total of four magicians and alchemists were busy inside, and the arrival of Richard and Lina did not attract their attention, and they did not look up. The materials they experimented with were humans, beasts, and indigenous elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a row of cubicles at the end of the hall, only enough for one person to lie down. There is a pregnant female in each compartment, not only humans, but also indigenous elves, Norland elves, orcs, and pure Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, it is a set of alchemy instruments that Richard can’t name. The scarlet liquid boils in a vessel and flows through a transparent tube to another container. A gnome alchemist is concentrating on the liquid scent, releasing a specific spell from the container. His assistant was always ready to hold the tablet, and recorded any words spoken in the warlock's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the iron cage placed against the wall, three human strong men are surrounded by an indigenous elf girl, glaring at her. In another iron cage, an elf man with a very delicate appearance is having a feast with a human woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, the blood of the Indigenous Elf and the various species will be combined by means of large-scale crossbreeding, mixed blood, or a black magic sacrifice. A particularly strong or particularly weak combination, and then continue the next study." Lina explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard frowned slightly, saying nothing, followed Lina to the next space. There are two old magicians working at the desk, documents and data everywhere, and several alchemy machines are high-quality goods, all for auxiliary calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a warehouse behind, which stores samples of various organs and blood, which are nearly a thousand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the incubation room, the exhibition room, the beast room and the material recovery room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although dark, cruel and bloody, Richard has to admit that he sees a complete and rigorous system, and has a rich and sophisticated approach. Guidance, such a scale has apparently accumulated a large amount of data. If it is not the experimental material, it is a large-scale and well-equipped magic experiment base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full circle, Richard and Lina went out of prison and went to Lina’s own magic lab. Her laboratory was just built, and the scale and equipment were very simple. However, when the experimental samples here are all kinds of Warcraft, Richard still feels refreshed and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina also seems to have become a little easier, pointing to all kinds of Warcraft in the cage, saying: "They are all unique to Warcraft, I need Find out which one is the most appetizing for the dragon. If not, try to cultivate one yourself. It is not so easy to raise a dragon as a partner!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the red dragon of the Dragon Master and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually..." Lina said, "What you just saw is the establishment of Xiong Peter when he managed the Greenson plane." The Warcraft Cultivating Lab. Those equipment and magicians and alchemists were left behind. The Gordon adults kept this system, and I am helping them to maintain. This lab is the core secret of the Schumpeter family. First, their town bear knights, as well as many other cultivating Warcraft and cultivating warriors, come from a similar system. The purpose of Schneider's establishment of the laboratory we just saw is to find out the indigenous blood of the plane. The weaknesses, and thus the extinction of them through the means of plague. The indigenous people of this plane are surprisingly strong, and the Xiong Peter family has not been able to expand the sphere of influence after decades of war, so they will think about it. In addition, they also coveted the powerful abilities of the indigenous elves and tried to separate them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was indulging, not immediately speaking, Is asking: "Is there any progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows a little bit that the force of the Xiong Peter family is not very outstanding, but also faintly guessed that Mensa used all kinds of means. Even he did not hesitate to give up Joseph to win over Bear Peter, what exactly is fancy. Sinclair’s dying request suddenly rose to his heart, and Richard could not help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina considers the words and says, "It’s only a phased one. If you want to get really effective results, I’m afraid it will take more than a decade of research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "It seems that this plane is more troublesome than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, otherwise the Schumpeter family will not operate for so long, or only such a city. In contrast, their greatest gain may be the experimental base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "The staged results you just mentioned are brought to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
