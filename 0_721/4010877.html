Now that I am fighting, I will be able to grasp it, but if there is such a thing, what can I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his finger and say, "No, this time it is mainly on me, and it doesn't have much to do with you. I will handle it personally on Brahms. Well, in fact, my knight has On the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." What St. Martin wants to say, eventually deflated, reluctantly said: "Since you have sent the knights out "And that's what I am looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just let you know." Richard said at the same time, by the way, what is behind this incident? There are a few hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin standing in a dilapidated temple, looking at the light curtain that was dimming in front of him, could not help but smile and shake his head, this time Brahms made things It seems that it is really urgent to give Richard, but I don’t know the madman of Archimonde, and this time I have to do a lot of things before I will give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pondered for a moment, and activated the communication matrix of the Holy Scriptures in his hand. After inputting his own unique divine power, there were six in the light circle. A phantom, can only see that it is a person who is covered in a robe, and can't see the face at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All troops are on standby, ready to fight, and awaken the apostles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication Law The six illusions in the array were all shocked, one of them asked: "Which apostle to wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three, all awaken." Martin The sound is cold but very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another phantom said in a hoarse voice: "His Royal Highness, I need to remind you that it is not yet time for the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said faintly: "Before you prepare, you may have a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Martin’s determination Six virtual shadows all expressed obedience, and the light of the communication law matrix gradually faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Martin, there was a sly figure, she was just a faint shadow, and her face was vague, but the two pairs of stretched light wings behind him were eye-catching, which was the symbol of the people of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will expose a lot of hidden strength, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin is charming The smile, the eyes seem to penetrate a lot of time and space, and fall far away. "Sometimes it is too stable, not a good choice. If the opportunity really comes, try to catch it, isn't it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have made a decision, then I will fully support you." Light and shadow said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of Longyi Castle today is very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the owner of the castle, the famous Marquis of Brahms on the northeastern border of the Holy Tree Dynasty, is in a very bad mood today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the Dragon Wing Castle, but the entire Marquis collar, as long as Brahms' mood is worse, it is winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang from the Marquis study, a centuries-old history, has signed several desks known throughout the dynasty agreement. Finally, at the end of history, the screaming Marquis was crushed, crushed with the table, and there was an urgently sent back information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An army is leading the Marquis, a unit belonging to the Archimonde family, and they have not concealed their destination, that is The Marquis of Brahms, their trip, is to investigate the looting of the Red Eagle's Feathers Corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigate the army and investigate a robbery in the territory of Brahms, and even the steps of the lord of the Marquis of Brahms It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving this information, the arrogant and arrogant Marquis Brahms only felt his face burning, as if he had been slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard in the center of the army is in a bad mood. He wants to fly alone to the Brahms collar and directly push the Dragon Wing Castle. But now he is leading the army, how fast the troops march, and the speed is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than three hundred kilometers from the Brahms territory. How can we take a day? If the star is brought, this distance is only a few hours, but the ability of the star to carry is limited. This army is brought from the main force to the auxiliary forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard went to the Marquis of Brahms to 'investigate' his own god Mu Wujin was robbed, but there is nothing to keep in mind, so bring it directly The army of 50,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50,000-strong army of Archimonde, the concept and the general aristocratic private army are completely different, the last time Archimonde’s independence was the 'conventional war', Li The inspection was to lead to less than 100,000 troops and to fight thousands of miles. In one fell swoop, the three empire totaled nearly one million interfering forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lineup of the strong side can not be compared with the last time, but this time the 50,000 people, the strength is enough to level a few Dukes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund entered the era of Richard, and the meaning was completely different from the period of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangdun had an unparalleled personal charm that year, and the talents of the throne were the ones who were chosen for the time. He and the soldiers fought together. Drinking and noisy together, the Archimonde warriors at that time had good individual strength, but also known for poverty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the period of Richard, supported by the enormous resources of the sacred architects, the individual strength of the Archimonde soldiers is still the same, the equipment is reborn, one All of them are armed to the teeth, that is, the standard of the ordinary troops is directly forced to the guards of the great aristocracy, and the combat power is directly doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 50,000 troops, there is no way to take shortcuts, only to honestly drive from the ground, and this way, originally also Richard One of the purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the smoke on the horizon rises and a group of knights come at a speed. This team of knights is playing the banner of three families. Slowed down, then led by a team of Archimonde Knights to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the family logo on the banner, you know that it is the two Viscounts and an Earl. The three of them are on the marching line of Richard, this time. In the expedition, Richard informed them in advance according to the convention, saying that it was ahead of schedule, and only a few hours ahead of schedule, so the three lords came very rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Archimonde's huge military, especially the ordinary warriors wearing armor with a faint magical brilliance, the three lords quietly took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older Piaget horse came to Richard and respectfully asked: "His Royal Highness, you are here for the purpose of"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I lost something in the territory of Brahms, and I have to investigate it now," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count and the two viscounts took a breath of cold air and could hardly believe their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Brahms is a big man, because of the close relationship with the high-level church, many dukes in the sacred dynasty are not willing to offend him, but Richard But he has to go to his territory to 'investigate'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of investigation is not as good as direct military conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl is a nobleman of the sacred dynasty. At this moment, the smile on his face is somewhat unnatural, and he really doesn’t know what to say. Dry and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee waved his hand, and a team of murderous knights sent the three lords away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, the army of Richard has appeared on the border of Brahms, there is a small town, and there is a swordsman in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is located in a popular place of business, very prosperous, and is an important tax point, so the garrison here, in the Marquis private army It is also very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was walking in front of the army at this time. He had already seen the checkpoints on the road. All the hundreds of swordsmen in the battalion were dispatched, and the array blocked the road. The central government is a few knights. Looking at this posture, it is clear that it is not ready to put the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time with Richard's expedition, it is the blood of the Holy Knight Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha glanced at the troops who guarded the customs, and said indifferently: "Brams is trying to test my determination, Senma, go Let them know about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma flirtatiously yawned and said, "I am going, this is too much for them." After that, there was some reluctance to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Blood Knight, there are hundreds of knights to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the checkpoint, hundreds of swordsmen stood proud, but they all began to have fear. They were light armored swordsmen, and Senma brought them out. It is the reloading of the knight, even if the two sides are of equal grade, the hundred heavy riders can easily kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knights as officers have also been shaken, but the most central knight in the middle of the world is not afraid, proudly said: "Don’t be afraid, we are The people of the sacred dynasty, forgive them, they dare not really do it. This kind of small scene, Lao Tzu sees more, brothers, they give me straight, just put them here, it is a great achievement, go back to me let My sister went to talk to the Marquis, everyone has a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to him, the swordsman’s camp seemed to be quite a bit, immediately One by one began to emerge again, belonging to the arrogant color of senior soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Samma and her knight approached, the knight shouted: "Stand up, here is the territory of the Marquis of Brahms. Without permission, no one is allowed to enter, and the offender is at his own risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s voice is loud and powerful, as if even in the distance, Richard’s army He came across the ground, and he was not afraid at all, and even his face was proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma said in a lazy voice: "My Highness is going to do something small here, and you dare to stop the road. The dog's eyes are all stunned." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s face was blue and white, and he couldn’t hang it at once. He slammed his sword and shouted: “A group of dogs from the countryside, I will take care of your house. Who, do you know that Lao Tzu is the man of the Marquis, this is the sacred dynasty, not your country, how many people, unless you want to fight with the sacred dynasty, otherwise you will be fucking I am standing here, as for your **"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the Cavaliers’ swear words stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma did not know when he had arrived in front of him, the long rifle flew up and kneeled on the knight’s face, and he even smoked with a rifle. He slaps a slap in the face and pulls him out from the horse. The blood of a few teeth is a few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
