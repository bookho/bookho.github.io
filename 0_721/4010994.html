			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of Richard suddenly became indifferent and tough, which made Mecks suddenly uncomfortable. She stood up tenaciously and asked, "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the battlefield. The reaper is eliminated a little less."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going! I can support it!" Mex said with a grin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, her face suddenly slaps a slap! This is not too heavy, but she has been beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you now play a flesh-and-blood warrior? Can you support it? Can you hold it or can I hold it? This is war Not your royal outing hunting game!" Richard said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex couldn’t speak for a moment, just glaring at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked suddenly and suddenly sighed: "It’s my fault, I shouldn’t bring you, or I should organize you into other groups. Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Richard recruited and the messenger carried him up and quickly went away. Only Mex himself was left in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex faintly guessed something. She stood alone for a while, gritted her teeth, walked into the cave where the worker bees had just dug, healed the wound and repaired the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, and Mecks suddenly panicked and scared. In addition to the busy worker bees entering and leaving the valley, no other creatures can be found. She has done all the things, and now she is only waiting for the injury to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the worker bee brought in a food and then never had any interaction with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex has a feeling suddenly, as if he had been abandoned by the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, and Mex is getting more and more uneasy. She is afraid of silence and afraid of loneliness. Now, the quieter it is, the more difficult the war is. Mex has now confirmed that there must have been an accident that led to a sudden change in Richard’s attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She forced herself to calm down and began to seriously remember every detail of the battle with the Reaper. Thinking about it, Mecks suddenly came down with a cold sweat. She found that if it wasn't for Richard, she already had no idea how many times she died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she has a harvester is not difficult to deal with, but also because Richard is like a thunder, the vast majority of the reapers are packed, leaving A little remnant of the down should be deliberately given to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not with Richard, but with other legends or celestial sanctuaries, then Mex is absolutely impossible to fight so easily, even Will become the weakest part of the team, and will be first killed by the reaper. Only Richard has the ability to protect Mex in the battle with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex has suddenly realized that the strength he once proud of is simply not enough to board such a battlefield! This conclusion made her extremely difficult to accept, but this is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near midnight, there was a sudden burst of sound in the distance. A glimpse of Mecks’s heart immediately rushed out of the hole and saw a few messengers flying fast in the night sky. Together they carry an extremely large body, the chief of the ogre, Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger slowly put down the tiramisu, this extremely powerful ogres lord but standing still standing, directly sitting down Ground, then simply lay down and keep breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu is still awake, but another head called the three-pointed is always unconscious, the one-horn has been broken, leaving A fleshy root. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu’s extremely heavy steel armor is broken, and there are several pieces that are like tears that are torn by life, and Mecks is frightened. . The ogre is full of wounds, some wounds up to one meter deep, and even deep nicks on the bones. Through a wound on the side of the rib, Mex even saw the corner of the beating heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the ogre's vitality is abnormal, it can't be moved by such a heavy injury. The most severe wounds flashed a strangely bright green glow and have lost the ability to heal automatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex hurriedly asked, "What's wrong with you? Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu turned his head and smiled. He said, "It turned out to be Miss Micks. If you can, please help me with some life-recovery medicine. I need to drink a box and put some medicine on the wound." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on!" Mex quickly moved a few boxes of life-recovery pharmacy, drunk the man, and cleaned the wound for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel armor of Tiramisu is as thick as a dozen centimeters, although Mex is also a heavy swordsman, but such a heavy armor still sees her somewhat Tooth acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex is well aware of how terrible an ogre has reached the legendary level, not to mention a double-headed ogre. But even if Tiramisu is so strong, it actually hurts like this. She suddenly realized that this is the true face of the war with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle of life-recovery agent is poured over the ogre's wound. The doses of these agents are prepared for humans, and it takes only one case for tiramisu to have a bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When trying to clean up the wounds for the ogre, Mex whispered: "Is it difficult to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu smiled and said: "The reaper can't deal with it. I haven't had this pain for a long time. Ah! The stomach is finally hungry, thank you! Miss Mex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to feel hungry, it means that the body's self-recovery ability has regained its effect. The worker bees received the call of the ogre and immediately transported a box of battlefield food. Tiramisu directly tears the package and pours a box into the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex sits next to the ogre and hesitates, asking: "Is there something happening in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu grabbed his head and said, "Morning... Oh, yes, I heard that I have died. A team of people is dead. Now it is possible. More dead people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexton was shocked and bit his lower lip and asked, "What about Richard?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu shook his head and said, "I don't know. It is said that the first person went to the depths of the Reaper control area and wanted to take the body of the team back. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He...one??" Mex suddenly felt that he couldn't breathe. Then ask: "When those people die, don't they... become flesh and blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what, head I have to grab it back. I can’t get it back, I have to ruin it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex no longer speaks, holds his knees and bury his face Get up, just wait, I don't know what I am waiting for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, two messengers flew over, and Splash and Zonghu each jumped from the messenger with two sanctuaries. There are not many injuries on them, but several sanctuaries are scarred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the strength of Mex is not very high, the knowledge is unusual. She is very clear that people like Shuihua and Zonghu are either not injured and are seriously injured once they are hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zong Hu saw Mex, his eyes were a bit complicated, and he snorted and went to pick up supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Splash is just wrinkled, there is nothing else to say. This girl killer has become even less since the promotion of the legend. Sometimes she doesn't see a word in one day. The coldness at this time can be said to be normal, or it can be said to be abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua and Zonghu silently treated the wounds, and then helped the Sanctuary of their hands to heal the wounds, and they each found a new lounge dug out of the worker bees. Those sacred sects did not talk much, they all learned the appearance of Shuihua and Zonghu, and immediately went to rest after treating the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the valley is suddenly suppressed, only the ogre is still eating. At this time, the three-point ripening gradually wakes up and eats together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scene that looks very happy, but Mex knows that it is not. The ogre eats hard and serious. For it, eating is healing and restoring strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night sneaked away like this. In the valley, only the sound of the worker bees crawling up and crawling and the chewing of the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex sits on a large rock with his knees, only feeling that the night wind is getting colder. In fact, as a sanctuary strong, she has already been immune to this degree of cold. However, Richard never came back. Only when he saw him, Mex felt that he could dispel the cold and uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s getting brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre has been lying down to sleep, and Mecks is still sitting. The heavy dew wet her long hair and let the blond hair stick to her forehead. And her face began to pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small black spot suddenly appeared in the distant horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, a messenger appeared in the field of vision, except that the trajectory pulled by the messenger was slightly skewed. When it flew over the valley, it finally couldn't help, and a huge wound suddenly appeared on the side of the body, spraying a lot of mucus. The messenger was planted, and the person carrying the back was also taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over and fell to the ground, but then his knees were soft and almost fell, relying on the support of the knife, which was half-squatting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" Mocks jumped up and rushed over to raise Richard. However, she suddenly shuddered and slowly took back one hand and glanced at the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hand is full of blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha straightened his body and waved his hand and said, "Nothing, it will hurt for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you still said nothing!" Meek looked at the blood in his hand, his voice trembled. She was not such a bloody character, but Richard is a super strong! He can't stop bleeding all the way back. What is the point of this injury? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a shot of Mex’s hand and signaled nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the splashes, Zonghu and Tiramisu came out from the rest and came to the front of Richard, forming a circle and looking solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a pocket and opened it, revealing a woman’s hand inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very beautiful hand with a huge ring of black gems on the index finger. The person present may not know this hand, but he will remember this distinctive ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex suddenly grabbed his mouth and tried not to let himself cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
