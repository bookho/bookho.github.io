			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient battlefield deep underground, there have been thousands of worker bees Busy. They diverted the river into a new water storage lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the original hill, a huge castle is being built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worker bee hurriedly climbed through the plane and ran to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, the channel that has always been calm has suddenly oscillated, and a flame is suddenly ejected from the inside. Then, a huge black hoof is extended from the portal, stepped out, landed, heavily stepped on the worker bee, and crushed into a bolognese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A four-meter-old demon walked out of the plane's portal, looked around for a moment, then took a deep breath and said in devilish words: "It's a really good place, it's too cold. Oh, it's true, the breath of the big lord has disappeared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a surprise roar I just wanted to explore the surrounding environment. As a result, I saw a group of human knights suddenly appearing in the castle where only half of the building was built in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Devil snorted heavily and said, "Small humans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District 10 Several knights are still not in the eyes of the big devil. It takes a big stride and heads for the knight. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two sides are still 100 meters away, the knights suddenly burst into anger, and then a spear with a vindictive spear is separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Devil suddenly gave birth to an extremely dangerous feeling, screaming, and immediately waved his arms and barely blocked the head and chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the first throwing a spear on his arm, blasted open, almost took the big devil's forearm halfway. In addition, several spears with additional armor effect were deeply immersed in the body of the demon, and two even penetrated directly into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the end, followed by the throwing spear. The demon's defensive state is in such a concentration, the fragile is like a bad shield, and it is smashed in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big demon obviously does not know what is the construction of the knight, but dare to harden the two teams to build a knight's fire attack, even the legendary strongman has few positive fronts. The abyss and the great demon are also at the highest level of the heavenly sanctuary. The result of hard resistance is to be killed in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big devil still doesn’t know, when he just walked out of the transmission channel and stepped on the worker bee, he was already perceived by the brain. The brain split immediately notified the guards here, and the first time they mobilized the two teams to build the knights to come and annihilate the enemies coming across the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are fanned out and slowly surrounded. The big devil is always alive and strong, and must be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A construction knight tried to poke the demon's body with a rifle, and after a few rounds with a vindictive gun tip, I found out that After the death, the safety signal was issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Masters immediately came to ride and went down to check the body of the Great Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wizards are obviously experienced and will be sent here to have an in-depth study of the demonics department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a mage said: "It is a big demon, and it is quite mature. It is customary to rely on the body to fight. But it seems that this system of demon equipment Very poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another mage is struggling to open the devil's head, picking up a hot crystal from inside, holding it in his hand and feeling it, saying "It's very bad. It seems that it has sent the news here back to the abyss. I don't think it will take long for us to face the army from the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is a big event. Let's return it to the top. As for the army of the abyss, I don't think I need to worry. There are more people who want to earn points. They probably only don't have enough demons."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, as a person in the family, we can't get points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not necessarily, I heard that His Highness has already considered The points exchange system is also implemented in the Kemeng. We will use part of the salary for our regular salary."<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several monks chatted while completing the on-site inspection of the Great Devil. They then let the knights carry the body of the great demon back to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the dragon, the devil is also equivalent to a mobile treasure house, the high-grade demon is almost all the magical material. Therefore, the body of this great demon can not be wasted, even though it is so smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Sanctuary strongmen then rushed in and walked into the plane of the plane, and found that there were already many big devils on the other side of the abyss, and more The demons are gathering, and a demon army has taken shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Sanctuary strongmen smothered a few of the demons that were thrown up and returned to the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the devil will sooner or later discover that the Great Abyss has died and then flooded into the initial place. So he has already set up castle fortresses on the ancient battlefield and arranged troops. The defense system of the castle is powered by the concentrated strength of the plane. It can be said that the energy is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is now only half completed. The main project is not complicated, but the core of this castle is similar to the Master Tower. The main time spent is the setting of various large defense and attack magic arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the devil appeared in the initial place, and the news that the demon army began to assemble on the other end of the channel was placed on Richard’s desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got the report, Richard frowned slightly, and the demon appeared much faster than he expected. This is not good news. And from the size of the demon army in intelligence, it is likely to include a small lord-level demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard now needs to strengthen the defense system of the initial place. The first thing he did was simple, but it was also the most effective: publicly announced the opening of the second point of the battle zone, the region is the ancient battlefield of the initial place, the goal is to fight the abyss demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news came out and many of the strong players boiled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them are skills that are controlled by the dragon race, while others are good at dealing with demons. The happiest is undoubtedly the majority of the ordinary sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devils are different from dragons, and their average unit strength is much lower than that of dragons. The ordinary sanctuaries are of little use in fighting the dragons, at least the heavenly sanctuary can hold the dragons in front, and then these ordinary sanctuaries will once again swarm and slam from the side of the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the devil is not the same, a sanctuary can barely block a big demon, those ordinary demons and little devils can sweep a piece . I heard that Archimonde has opened up a point battlefield that connects the abyss. They are naturally excited and are planning to do a big job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of a new battlefield is not as simple as it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to consume the rapidly increasing points, Richard must expand the production base on a large scale in order to convert massive dragons and demonic materials into materials, sacrifices and equipment, Construction. Nearly a thousand mages in the sub-planets such as Deep Blue and Faro are now working for Richard. But this is just a war that can cope with the dragon plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard decided to raise the treatment of all mages, craftsmen and alchemists again and increase their rewards by 30%. This treatment has already allowed the mages who work for Archimonde to earn half the income of their fellows in other giants, and the attraction has suddenly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news has just spread in the dark blue, and more than 50 mages have signed up to prepare for Archimonde. This trend of human growth has made Richard feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the news spreads out on the mainland, it is conceivable that more mages will soon be willing to work for Richard. At the same time, Richard has once again expanded the scale of his weapons workshop, and is prepared to double the production capacity directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Richard has not cared too much about some of his low-end product technology being stolen, which has allowed the scope of recruitment of the workshop to expand accordingly. Can handle the demand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scheduling the expansion plan, Richard took a few followers and sent them to the Millennium Empire to prepare for sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the material handling and equipment production capacity can not keep up, the equipment obtained from the sacrifice is a good complement to the redemption plan. And this time the sacrifice, the purpose of Richard is not so simple, he has another idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Tumen still sent Mex to receive Richard, and accompanied Richard to the eternal dragon temple to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the Dragon Hall, several great priests immediately greeted them with enthusiasm and surrounded the Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the no-face words, and when he laughed, he reached out to a young and beautiful grand priest and confirmed that she was the host of her sacrifice. Then ask: "What about the Dragon Temple Lord? Why don't you come out to see me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These official faces are a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the Dragon Temple and the chief priest is not shallow. The chief priest is equivalent to being expelled from the eternal dragon hall by Richard, presiding over the dragon temple. How can I give Richard a good look? If it wasn’t for her that she wouldn’t have any idea of ​​taking Richard, I’m afraid to use the power of the Eternal Dragon Hall to kill Richard directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulously, she could only avoid seeing it. I didn’t expect Richard to think about her, and asked her to come out. I am afraid that this is not only a simple lack of etiquette, but another purpose behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time that Richard expelled the chief priest, the first time these big priests understood what was called the privilege level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority of Richard is much higher than that of these ordinary priests, so he can almost do what he wants in the Temple of Eternal Dragons, even if he is expelled from the priesthood. The behavior has also been recognized by the Eternal and the Dragon of Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Richard also pays the same price, and the ability to use the authority has to pay the corresponding price. At this point, the old dragon is always the most impartial. When Richard eliminates the gods, he also needs to pay a lot of grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the disappearance of the divine grace, the problem is simple. Naturally, it is recycled by the eternal and the dragon of time. So in that conflict, the old dragon was the biggest winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the level of authority, the big priests are not much different from each other, no one can help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the lord and the chief priest. The division between them is mainly based on the level of divine power and the accumulation of divine power, and the other is political factors. Therefore, the difference between the so-called lord of the Dragon Temple and these big priests is nothing more than 21, and 18 is 18. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
