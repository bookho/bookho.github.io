			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei spread the map and take a closer look at the terrain and the situation. The troops with the brigade infantry moved very slowly. It took a full day for the team to go to the Richards territory 50 kilometers away, and it took a night to attack before the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the blood-stained land and the territory of the Sequoia Kingdom, the terrain is sharply elevated, and the territory of Richard is hundreds of meters higher than the blood-stained land. The grounding belt is complex, and many places are rugged and difficult. It is a natural land for soldiers. Richard decided to circumnavigate the unicorn priest in this area. Although the number of his troops is small, but it is the elite of the rest of the war, and Richard pays attention to the mobility of the troops. This is the battlefield that is suitable for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls slowly, and the army of Viscount Heim is also stationed. After a restful night, you can reach Richard’s territory at noon tomorrow. Baron Xiaofang Dan accepted the viscount's entanglement and refused to provide Richard with labor and building materials. Therefore, Richard now has no decent fortifications in his hands. Even the barracks are just temporary buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, in the huge and gorgeous camp in the center of the camp, the Viscount is walking around, sometimes cursing Richard, and sometimes imagining After I caught Richard, how could I torture him? I couldn’t sleep at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four beautiful aristocratic girls in the camp, so the big camp is also a bit crowded. They poured water into the wine for the viscount, and they did the work of the maid. In fact, the real identity is the lady of each big aristocratic family. As for the tradition of the kings who did not bring women, it was only relative to the regular military, and there was no natural binding on the Viscount. Moreover, most of this unit is a smuggler's private soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the viscount of Heim, wielding his fists, snarling and screaming to fight in the territory of Richard, completely defeating the true aristocratic temperament and demeanor. From the countryside where the knights emerged, under the cover of the night, a horse was emerging from the darkness and slowly approached the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wars on the horseshoe to avoid making a sound. The immediate sand people are all masters who control the horses, so the horses underneath are very docile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the camp, a small team of Viscount soldiers were patrolling around the camp and gradually approaching the sand people in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and other patrols walked over and raised their right hand. Oral immediately took out the longbow and aimed at the camp. When Richard's right hand was put down, the two enchanted long arrows flew like meteors, silently shot 100 meters away, nailed to the two sentinels standing on the camp tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sentinels immediately planted from the tower, although they could not make a sound, but the sound of heavy objects still awakened a lot of alert soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s hand pointed forward again, so behind him, dozens of sand people rushed to the military camp, and several barbarians also took a big step To the camp, three or two times, with a huge axe in his hand, opened a simple fence, rushed into the camp, just saw several soldiers ran out of the camp. The barbarian snorted and the giant axe swayed. After a few moments, the soldiers who had not fully adapted to the darkness were cut down and then rushed to another camp. The screams in this camp were loud, but the soldiers were still wearing armor and they didn’t know that death had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two strong barbarian warriors surrounded the camp with one left and one right, then took a deep breath and picked up the axe! The giant axe screamed and slid from the waist of the camp, and the sound inside stopped suddenly! The camp that was cut off was directly collapsed, and the blood on the cloth was quickly spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two barbarian warriors were still unfinished, and they smashed a few axes on the draped tent, and the axe saw blood, and then they stopped. After a moment of delay, more than a dozen fighters in front of them were lined up under the command of a junior officer, blocking their footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a burning fireball flew out of the darkness and landed in front of the soldiers, and the raging fire wave directly blew four soldiers. And the same number of soldiers will be burned into a torch. The barbarian warrior did not fear the fire, strode over the opponent's remnant, and rushed to the junior officer. They are not trying to kill more enemies, but more importantly, creating chaos and killing junior officers. As long as there are no officers, then these low-level infantry are a group of scattered sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian’s giant axe lifted up and suddenly felt like a breeze passed by. At this time, on the battlefield, in the flames and vindictive environment, how can there be a breeze? The barbarian’s eyes squinted and the heavy axe condensed in the air, ready to make a thunder blow. However, the low-ranking officer opposite the body suddenly became stiff, and a dull blade protruded from his chest. It was at this moment that someone had already put him in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly ghost appeared from behind the officer. She half-bowed her body and swiftly passed between the two barbarians and hid behind them. The barbarian warrior knew that the twilight was also the soldier around Richard, so he roared and the giant axe waved and stumbled several soldiers chasing the twilight one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked along the edge of the camp, and his mind was already well aware of the situation in the entire camp. There was chaos in the camp now, and three directions were infiltrated by the soldiers under Richard. The huge eye-catching camp of Viscount Heim was less than a hundred meters from Richard. However, hundreds of elite guards have been assembled around the camp, and a 14th-level general is shouting and commanding, constantly gathering chaotic warriors, and organizing them into a line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a chaotic situation, it is also possible to quickly organize a line of defense and protect the Viscount of Hem, indicating that this general can be good, and the knights are brave. Elite. Seeing the strict line of defense around the big account, Richard dismissed the idea of ​​raiding the Chinese army and catching Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ** that hit the night has not arrived yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking in the darkness, Richard constantly fired a fireball. The huge coverage of the fireball often ignites three or four stacks of tents at the same time. With the help of the night wind, the fire continued to spread in the camp, creating more chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the camp’s horse circle suddenly sounded an exclamation. No one noticed a gray-black light ball flying into the horse circle, and then quietly Silent burst. The bursts of mental shock immediately caused the knights who guarded the horse to fall into fear, and the horses were frightened and began to break the bite and try to break the reins. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of chaos, the whistling whistling sounds in the night sky, a flying hand axe broke through, and the shackles in the chaos fell from seven or eight. The hand axe is very powerful, even if it is a majestic war horse, it will be hard to break the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, the horse ring fence was hit by two ogres. The barbarians and the sand people followed them in, staring at them and killing them. Another intensive range of fear falls in the middle of the shackles. The magical drop point is calculated very accurately, and the positions of the sand people are also in disorder, just not affecting them. As for the barbarians, they naturally have a brave heart, and the effect of fear on them is very small. The second fear fell, and half of them fell into extreme horror, and the battle immediately turned into a one-sided slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
