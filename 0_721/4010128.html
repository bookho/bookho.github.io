			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quest for ten days, originally gathered in Canovan The tribes of Mori were almost killed. At this point, the last huge threat was completely removed from the passage leading to the pale dwarf country. In the camp of Canovenson, Richard lost nearly 5,000 soldiers, and the damage of the tribes was several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than two hundred kilometers from the pale highlands in the northwest. There is no powerful force in this area. Another place, the ruins of Zhubwal, is the city of the legendary troll empire, but it is said that with the drying up of several rivers, the forest that originally covered this tens of thousands of square kilometers of vast areas gradually disappeared, the trolls of the past The country also went from prosperity to decline and eventually perished. Now within the ruins of Zhubwal, there are still a few tribes of trolls. Although the tragic and tragic trolls are one of the natural enemies of human beings, these small tribes are only a few hundred in size, and there is no need to use the army. It is enough to use only some of the hen’s nest soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are no real valuable treasures in the ruins of Zhubwal. The trolls are very popular with wood and stone, but metal processing techniques are very backward. So in the place where they live, there are not many items that are valuable to humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s purpose is not to collect wealth, but to collect all kinds of possible sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western end of the blood-stained land began to gradually appear undulating mountains, and the terrain became more complex and changeable. There are few human settlements here, and there are only a few of the most powerful arresting groups in this activity. However, the resources in this area are not rich, and it is difficult to find the special products that make people feel excited. Therefore, if you take risks here, you will not be able to pay for it. Only by adventuring through this area and arriving in the dwarf country will it be possible to exchange some rare minerals. However, due to the existence of the Camp Noto Camp, this area can be said to be interracial, with heavy minerals trying to cross this land, often nine lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in the eyes of the humans that this land is very risky and poorly harvested, and few people are willing to get involved here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation was different after Richard attacked Canovenson. A large number of rare minerals obtained from the dwarf country can be escorted by the army and transported back to the human kingdom. This is an ore of thousands of tons, and the benefits are tens of millions after returning. The aliens living in the blood-stained land, whether or not, orcs, trolls, or ogres, will not be stupid enough to challenge a 10,000-strong army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the troll empire, Richard stationed the army and allowed the nobles to reorganize and recuperate themselves, and Richard himself followed the followers. As well as hundreds of female nest warriors, began to explore the ruins of Jubval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the troll empire is full of rolling hills and hills, and the dead giant trees are always visible. The ground is full of cracked rocks and dry floating soil. Richard walked through the dead trees, and had been walking for two days. He did not see much vitality. Occasionally there were several vultures flying over the sky. In addition, there were no living creatures. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second day onwards, stone carvings half buried in the ground, totem poles carved in wood, and some rocky paths that were submerged by wormwood began to appear in the field of vision. . These traces indicate that they have officially entered the troll country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Richard stood on the edge of a cliff, carefully scooping out half of his body and looking down. Below is a rift valley that is hundreds of meters deep, with some thorny stone pillars on the bottom and some sleek rocks around the pillars. There is a clear scouring trail at the bottom of the cliff. It seems that many years ago, this rift was actually a raging river. But now, the river has long been unaware of how many years it has dried up. Only a few small shrubs can be seen in the shadows at the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ends of the cliff are separated by tens of meters, and the wind whizzes past the Rift Valley, sending out a heart-rending scream. On the other side of the cliff, if you look far and wide, you can see a faint green, where the forest is still alive. The rift that blocked Richard’s way was twisted and twisted, and the ends could not see the end. If you detoured, you don’t know how much time to spend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not far from Richard’s side, standing on two large square pillars with obvious signs of abrasion. The tops of these two pillars are engraved with the image of the animal head with long fangs. It is known to be the style of the troll. Opposite the cliff, two identical stone columns were erected, but only one of them was left. It seems that before I did not know how long ago, a rope bridge was built on the cliff, but now only four pillars of the rope bridge cable are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the cliff environment and told him: "Get the rope!" After a few moments, several free Archimonde fighters carried a large plate. The rope is enough for hundreds of meters. In this expedition, Richard made ample preparations and brought all the freedom fighters from Noland. They may not have outstanding personal strength, but they have rich experience in combat and adventure. They are the most explored. Good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness of consciousness, there are several giant bats flying in the sky, they together bite the rope and fly across the cliff. The ropes grew longer and finally crossed the cliff. At this moment, an amazing scene appeared. Several bat teeth were biting and clawing, and the rope was coiled on the opposite stone pillar. It also had a strong knot! Free Archimonde warriors have never seen this scene, and many people stay on the spot. Who can imagine that the bat will also tie the knot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rope ran over the cliff and it was simple. Luofu, who is known for his agility, took another rope and stepped on the first cable to the opposite side of the cliff and fastened the second bridge. Then a root bridge is fixed and then the newly cut wood is laid on the bridge. An hour or so, a rope bridge reappeared on the cliff. Richard rode the unicorn to cross the bridge first, then a team of knights and humanoid warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the cliff, and then walking deep into the mountains for the whole afternoon, I can feel the greenness under my feet and the air has some moisture. When Richard looked for a flatland with an open view, he ordered a camp to rest. Sparse forests can be seen in front, and occasionally roaring from unknowns. After a day of trekking, it is not a good idea to let the tired soldiers hurry at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several huge bonfires in the camp that are enough to drive out the beasts. The sentinels were scattered around the camp in twos and threes, watching the mountains under the night with vigilance. Whenever there is always an elite bat hovering over the camp. Richard has brought in more than a dozen elite bats, and now half of them are flying deep into the mountains to survey the places to go tomorrow, and the other half are resting in the camp. But in the sky above the camp, a bat will always be flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the central camp, Richard is using a magic box as a workbench to quickly draw something on an enchanted paper. With the magic pen's stroke, a simple line outlines a undulating picture of the mountains. The picture is on the mountain where Richard is now, and the details are constantly extending deeper. Richard is painting the things the elite bat sees on the enchanted paper. The paper has already been painted with a magical array. Once excited, this is a three-dimensional magic map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of elite bats that can be patrolled is thirty kilometers. And now on the magic map drawn by Richard, there have been some things that interest him. Soon Richard completed the drawing of the magic map. After inputting the magic power, a holographic image of the surrounding area appeared in a light and shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the map, you can see a broken building. Although there are only a few broken walls, it is still possible to see that the entire layout of the area is very square. The layout of the square and the rectangular shape as the building and even the whole city is the characteristic of the troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
