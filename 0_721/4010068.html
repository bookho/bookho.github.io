			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris’s face has finally changed a bit, Dragon Master Lina also stood On the other side, there is also a surprise. She was not sure what Richard was doing, but was also shocked by Richard's meticulousness, concentration and patience. No one wants to have an enemy like Richard, and the Dragon Master is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that was not affected was the quicksand. At the beginning of the checkup, she went back to the camp for herself and went straight to sleep. The plane transfer is a very tedious thing, she has to restore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are not aware of the intention of Richard to do so, but she is clear. Really put it out, there is not much magic. By checking the process of name arms, Richard can have a certain understanding of the capabilities of each soldier through his own observations. He used to do this when he was in the Faro plane. Therefore, in the battle of the local battlefield, Richard grasps the ability of the already-armed fighters with great precision. Fights that can be solved with ten fighters generally do not send two more, and at most one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of naming is finally over. Everyone except Philip was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All officers are listed!" Under the command of Li, hundreds of officers and men of all sizes stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Richard took up the roster and glanced at these fierce warriors coldly, although the Dragon Master clearly handed over the command, but the soldiers’ The eyes are full of untamed. Richard paused for a while before saying: "Now, everyone is re-arranging! The formation method is as follows, the first squad of the first squadron, the captain is XXOO..., the squadron is ten people, respectively..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard’s speech is very fast, the soldiers are also well-trained, and the officers and soldiers who are ordered are assembled on their own and then regrouped. Slowly, many of the warriors' faces have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard Li Lang did not stop, and he did not look at the roster at all. Is it the process of just naming, he remembered everyone? How can this be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard regrouped all the fighters, people suddenly discovered that Richard really remembered everyone and immediately completed two thousand The reorganization of the remaining troops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the formation of the army, Richard took his hands and said: "Everyone must bear in mind that now belongs to everyone, everyone! From now on, on the battlefield, I The order will only reach the squadron level. All squadron leaders must bear in mind the number of their squadron, and strictly follow the order on the battlefield! If anyone is in violation of the order, hehe! At 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, he will send troops at 9:00 and attack the city at 9 o'clock. Now, all the rest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand soldiers have returned to the camp, and there are still dozens of soldiers left on the camp playground. This is Richard. The commander who prepared himself. These commanders need to be familiar with the military code on the battlefield to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the playground, Nyris and Agamemnon are still standing. Nyris held his chin and said thoughtfully: "This Richard looks like it really hurts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems? Thousands of people Above, with the same military power, he can destroy you three times." Agamemnon did not leave the face of the four emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris snorted and said hard: "This is going to be known before I hit it. And why should I fight with him and rush into the Chinese army?" It doesn't become a 12-level wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon only heard nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris shrugged helplessly and said, "Okay, okay! I am not as good as Richard, OK. Wait, it seems a bit wrong... Is this going to the barracks? All the troops have been re-edited. Why didn’t we have anything to do with us? He wouldn’t have taken us into consideration at all? We can definitely be high-end combat power!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A neglected high-end?" Agamemnon had a rare humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris's pretty little face is already blue, snoring, and it’s boring to stand alone on the playground, so he slammed back to the camp. I fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the military account, Richard is studying the terrain sand table of the rebel city alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this battle is the three magic towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the three original magic towers that play a major role in the battlefield and magic attacks. The effect of all magic in the demon area will be greatly weakened, which means that Lina's attack magic power is greatly reduced. On the other hand, the magical attack attached to the Magic Tower is very powerful and is equivalent to six levels of magic. The Great Magister must also be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of the three magic towers is to deal with the forest wild elves, so pay more attention to the coverage area and range of the attack magic, the single lethality is not too strong . The demon area is only basic, because the magic of the wild elves is very primitive. However, if every magic tower is used properly, it will play a huge role in the defense, especially if the other side has a sanctuary to cooperate with the tactics. It is the three most basic magic towers in which the rebels can continuously defeat the two attacks of the Dragon Master with inferior forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower's ability is supported by the magic pool. The magic pool can accumulate magic from the surrounding space by itself, but the speed is limited, and the magic of storage is limited. To eliminate the threat of the Magic Tower, one is to rush into the tower to kill the magician. The other is to use the magic of the magic pool in one fell swoop, and the magic tower will lose its effect. Finally, it is directly attacking the magic tower itself. If the hood is forcibly broken, the magic array in the magic tower will be damaged and will lose its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation, the threat of the attack of the magic tower itself is not great, and the rebels rely more on the role of the demon area. However, every time the magic zone weakens the magic in the area, it also consumes the magic of the magic pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the signs of the three magic towers, there are constantly new plans emerging in Richard’s mind, and finally several options are available. The three magic towers, the sanctuary and the rebel ordinary warriors, in the view of Richard, are the key points that can be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at 8:00 in the morning, 2,300 warriors were listed as neat teams, and they rushed out to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon, who were not assigned to the mission, also marched with the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were all draped, and the face helmet was covered with a face. The body-fitted plate armor is obviously tailor-made, and the faint magical fluctuations show that this is not just one or two enchanted bargains, and the specific natural texture that is close to the details reveals the two sets of armor. Staggering materials. However, the style of the two sets of armor is unpretentious, not only without any decorative heraldic things, but even the colors are gray and unremarkable, it seems a bit shabby. In addition, there are several obvious cracks in the seams of the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
