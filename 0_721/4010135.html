			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy wood is lit, and Richard will touch the flame on the maple amber The whole amber burns and emits a smoky smoke. When Richard sniffed a smog, he immediately felt that the whole world had turned black and white, and there was an image of a huge feather snake on the altar in front of nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked, and quickly held his breath, the magic of the body stirred, and this gradually disappeared the same feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw that his followers were a little different, and they recovered one by one. The flowing sand and the Iowo are all the same, and they are not affected at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the sand and look at the scroll in hand, saying: "Now, it is time to present the heart and blood of the traitor to Zuka."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrificed a gesture, and several Berserkers pulled the infected trolls to the altar. The sacrifice was pierced into the chest of the infected troll with the bone dagger, and their hearts were dug out and thrown into the burning stone basin. Each heart is thrown into a stone basin, and the flame of Maple Amber will be much more intense. When the tenth heart was thrown into the stone basin, the flame in the stone basin was simply erupting, and the fire pen rushed straight over ten meters high. Richard noticed that the heart of these infected trolls was a strangely dead gray, not a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an infected troll heart is dug out, the Berserker will drag the troll to the deep pit and throw it in. The troll's body was pierced by a thorn, and the blood continued to flow out. It flowed down the pit at the bottom of the pit to a specific corner. There was a small hole in it, sucking all the blood into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten infected trolls were slaughtered and sacrificed to Zuka as a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the altar suddenly dropped a lot, and instantly turned from hot to cold. Through the flame of the stone basin, Richard saw that on the altar, a virtual shadow of a giant feather snake appeared slowly. An invisible great will descends into the temple. This huge force makes everyone want to fear and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand surface is slightly changed, and whispered: "It is Zuka!" Her hand has already clenched the book of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door behind the temple suddenly opened, and a troll of up to ten meters entered the temple, and he held a spear. With a deafening voice, he screamed: "Who is this? Who dares to call Zuka? Who dares to destroy my plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troll is wearing Rare body armor, the giant spear in the hand up to three meters of spears, full of horrible jagged. At the end of the spear, two feathered snakes are engraved. The troll rushed a few steps and slammed the spear in his hand into the back of Zuka! The purple spear flashed on the giant spear, and Zuka struggled and roared, but its body became more and more blurred. It is obvious that the forces that make up its body are constantly being absorbed by the giant spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Zuka’s image was distorted and eventually screamed and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrificial saw this scene, and suddenly madly rushed to the altar and screamed: "Superintendent Drakazan! It turns out that you betrayed the great Zuka! You destroyed the great troll empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll warlord on the altar turned his big head and his eyes continued to sweep through the entire temple. It seems that I don’t see clearly what they look like. It growled impatiently: "Who is it? Who is hiding in the shadows and dare not come out? Come out! Come out and face the greatest superintendent Drakazan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The troll sacrifice climbed into the altar like a madman, pointing to the image of the superintendent who was several times higher than himself: "I am a sacrifice to Zambier, you are a betrayal, you are an evil spirit!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betrayal? No, I am not betrayal." The Warlord used a surprisingly serious tone and said, "I am trying to save Zhubwal. The river of life is dry, my son. The people and the soldiers are full of torture, and every day there are bodies that are transported from Zhubwal. At this time, the ancestral card that should have sheltered us has become more and more violent. It can’t find any way, but it will only I kept asking for more sacrifices. One troll dedicated his heart and blood to it, but could not fill its greed. Later, it even claimed its sacrifices! It is no longer the former ancestor Card, it has been completely lost in blood and strength. At this time, I heard another call of voice from a greater will than Zuka. She told me how to destroy Zuka, so I have dedicated myself and all the guards who are loyal to me, giving Zuka fatal blow, let Jubuwal out of its shadow "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This is a surprisingly heavy history, written with blood and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrificial stagnation for a moment, suddenly understood what, pointing to the troll warlord, loudly said: "Superintendent Drakazan! You have been evil spirits Bewildered, the great Zuka will not abandon its trolls. Don't argue, look at what you are now, your most evil non-death! It is your behavior that leads to the ultimate destruction of Zhubwal!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warlord has been sluggish for a moment, as if trying to think back. Suddenly holding his own head, he whispered in agony: "I...what is this? I heard what? How can Zhubwal be destroyed, at my last moment, not to attack the pale highlands, to those The damn dwarves are driving out of the hole!? Ah, yes, I am already dead, how can I appear here. Wait, I saw it! I saw you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Troll Superintendent became blood red, and its sight reflected through the blood layer again, and Richard, and all the followers involuntarily chilled, like I was poured a bucket of ice water! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll warlord became extremely cold, Mori said: "You, not from the same era as me, why do you bother me to sleep?" Wait! I saw different souls from you, you are not from our world. I think I understand, you are the destroyer and the savior that Zuka said. However, the troll empire has the greatest warlord ever. , Drakazan, will never allow you to resurrect Zuka!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troll Superintendent points to Richard and others, slowly raising the giant spear in his hand ! The warlord’s movements are very slow, as if holding thousands of heavy objects. As the giant spear rises, Richard’s heart suddenly flies through the dangerous feeling of a cold ice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warlord is a figure of thousands of years ago, and it is just a projection here, but I don’t know why it gives Richard a very dangerous feeling. Richard’s instincts have always been keen, and this is an advantage derived from the blood of the elves, not a hole in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the giant spear of the troll warlord ascended, and the troll sacrifice was still standing on the altar, and Richard suddenly yelled at the sacrifice: "Fast Point it with the storage tank! It is the evil spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll sacrifice is only awakened, it is agilely a back flip from the altar Down, grabbed the storage tank, flashed a crazy and absolutely look in his eyes, and yelled at the Warlord: "Dra Kazan! This is the end of your betrayal! Sleep in the saints, betrayal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
