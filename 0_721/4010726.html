			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small opening in the stone, but Richard’s eyesight How powerful, only this one, it is clear that the opening and the summoned gold son Gao De Ori's dagger is very consistent, it seems that not long ago, the golden dagger is inserted there, and Gao De Ori should be from the altar The blood pool came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the stone and asked, "Is there something that summons the King of Iron and the Friends of Silver?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Great Sacrifice replied, obviously becoming more nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked again: "They seem to have not been passive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Sacrifice Explanation Dao: "The process of summoning does not have to move them, as long as they are still in the summoning hall. They are said to be the weapons used after the return of the three ancestors, and the high darts of Gao De Ori took the gold dagger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and pointed to the rituals surrounded by the worker bees in the corner and asked: "They are the sacrifices responsible for summoning, summoning already Did you start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat on the face of the Great Sacrifice twitched a few times, glanced at the blood pool at the top of the altar, and said sternly: "The ceremony has already At the beginning, it took a few days for the two ancestors to stand up from the blood pool. This ceremony has been stopped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nod and said, "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, an old ritual in the corner shouted: "Intruder, We will never cooperate with you to close the summoning ceremony. When the ancestors come, you will all be turned into ashes in the molten iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the king of iron returns, no matter whether he can defeat us, but it will inevitably destroy the entire throne of the cold iron. At that time, people living in the emperor may not have much to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old rituals are distorted, and they gnash their teeth and say: "Since those ants are afraid to fight the invaders with you, it is damn, it is best to die."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and said, "Well, then you will die first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worker bees swarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s gaze fell on the blood pool again, saying to Axiris: “Let’s study this summoning array, then modify it, I need to know iron. The exact time of arrival of the King and the Friends of Silver, in addition, make the coordinates clear and let them arrive as soon as possible, I don't have much time to wait for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Asiris agreed, he flew to the altar and began to study the summoning circle on the altar. The scale of the circle was very large, and Achilles needed at least one day to study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinkers also walked to the altar, licking their bodies, examining them one by one in the altar hall, looking at it, intending to put all the halls in this altar The secrets were all excavated. It went to the blood pool, squatted in the pool and drank a few big mouthfuls of blood, and then went on to explore elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment's work, a lot of data about the composition of the blood pool was passed to Richard's consciousness, stored as a reference material, which is a special ability of the thinker. It can analyze and detect almost all substances, and in terms of accuracy, it is stronger than Richard's insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood pool is a special kind of blood, which contains a very strong essence of life, that is, the dead person is thrown into the blood pool, it will not last long. It will also be resurrected, except that the blood pool function is only repaired and resurrected, and it does not repair the soul. Therefore, the resurrection in the blood pool is just a meaningless body, but the three kings return to the spiritual state, just need This way there is no soul shell, otherwise the two souls will have a dominance battle in the same body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known from the secret book of the royal family that the key blood in the blood pool comes from a rare behemoth, which has a long life but multiplication. The rate is extremely low. In recent years, it has been on the verge of extinction. This is already the last pool. Such a pool of blood and water is worth the price. If it is not the value of the King of Iron and the Friends of Silver, Richard can't bear to let them consume it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice has already said it, so he was sent to the underground altar by two Knights, and Richard flew to the iron gun. The stone of the silver sword is going to study the weapons used by these two legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two long knives behind Richard, the moonlight and the abomination slaughter suddenly shocked. They even sent a strong desire to Richard, and wanted to immediately contact the two weapons and swallow them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big mistake in Li, a similar situation will only happen in artifacts with souls. Abominations are the weapons of sacrifice, and only the standard of artifacts After a series of opportunities, Moonlight has restored some of its former power, but the moonlight is only irremovable. This attribute has reached the standard of artifacts, and other attributes are still a little bit, so it is only enough to reach the edge of the artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the two long knives have simultaneously demonstrated that they have a certain degree of autonomous spirituality. This is the most basic feature of artifacts. Is it to follow their own enthusiasm? In the long years, these two weapons are gradually evolving and awakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and pulled out the silver sword, and looked at it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver sword style is simple, except for the extraordinary material, there is almost no special property. Even the magic weapon is somewhat reluctant, without special explanation. It is really hard to imagine that this would be a weapon of a legendary powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are examples of gold daggers first, and Richard sinks his heart to perceive the material of the silver sword, which has some special ingredients that he has never seen before. It is similar to Mithril, but it is more ethereal than Mithril. It seems to be the same as the hidden gold in the gold dagger. This silver sword also contains some special silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of a magician, a material that has never been seen before, value is far above itself, and all magicians are essentially scholars, especially In the process of studying the ectopic materials, they get far more benefits than the general magic experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard continued to observe the silver sword, the abomination slaughter was even more shocking. It even made a fine beep, a picture that could not wait, and the moonlight Instead, it became quiet, and it seemed that the interest in the silver sword had faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard’s heart, he folded a sword from the silver sword and took it out. Then he pulled out the abhorrence and put it on the silver sword. An astonishing scene took place. The abomination slaughter blade turned out to find countless tentacles. The silver sword was tightly wounded, the tentacles continued to grow, and the abomination slaughter and the silver sword were all wrapped up, just like a worm. Not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard perceives the process of fusion within the insects, which takes about a day or so, so he puts down his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron gun was pulled out, it was more unpretentious, and there were even a few patches of rust on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an interest in it, and the altar space is very humid. If the iron gun really rusts, it has been rusted for hundreds of years. When it fell, there would be only a few pieces of rust spots in the area. Richard took the iron gun and carefully observed and explored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is surprisingly long. After Richard’s spiritual reach deep into the iron gun, he unexpectedly discovered that it is an amazingly vast world. The structure of the world is very strange. Similar to iron, fine iron, and magic iron, they are different, and Richard also found that the material structure inside the iron gun is slowly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to perceive, observe, analyze, calculate, slowly find the law from the changes in the material structure of the iron gun, and begin to go inward, and finally, In a corner of the iron gun, Richard accidentally saw a crystal nucleus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nucleus is very small and constantly moving. Wherever it goes, all material structures are affected and changed, and this change will be * * Spreading to the surroundings, thus affecting the entire iron gun. It is because of the existence of this crystal nucleus that the whole iron gun will have a vitality, like a conscious creature to extract the surrounding iron elements and damage the rusted parts. Stripped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried several times, and the spiritual tentacles finally locked the nucleus, constantly calculating its trajectory, and the nucleus seemed to have its own wisdom. It seems that the crisis has come and it has begun to dodge quickly. Its speed is so fast that it is extremely difficult for Richard to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wisdom of Richard’s reaction and calculation speed is now extraordinary, the movement of the nucleus seems complicated, but in fact there are still rules to follow. Richard, who has studied dark blue meditation, has experience in capturing such trajectories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the laws of crystal nucleus movement are constantly being calculated, and the number of spiritual tentacles of Richard begins to increase, and gradually changes from blind chasing to After chasing and intercepting, the number of nucleus and spiritual tentacles has passed by more and more, and the situation is becoming more and more dangerous. However, the wisdom of the nucleus is limited, and the current situation cannot be changed. Finally, after a series of sharp turn, one end I smashed into the spiritual tentacles that Richard had already waited for, and was entangled in a solid state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
