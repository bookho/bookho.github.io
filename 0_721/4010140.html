			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, Richard. This barrel of wine is my one hundred and thirty One of the best wines I have tasted in the middle of the year. Although humans know that dwarves like spirits, only the wine you bring is the best.” Ba Moore pointed to the remaining three barrels and asked: “The three barrels of wine Is there any difference?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and said, “Why don’t you try it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" Barmool immediately let the guards open the three barrels of wine, and the elders used three rounds of light barrels of wine. These three barrels of wine are indeed worse than the original barrel of wine, and one barrel is lighter than a barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Barmomore, and looked at Richard’s eyes brighter. He touched his thick beard and said, "Is this what you are going to trade with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "The four barrels of wine are respectively It is the best, superior, medium and ordinary. The descendants of the great anvil, what do you think of the most common wine taste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bamor and Several elders looked at each other, and one of the elders said, "It is already very good. The best wine that humans sold to us in the past is this taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles more attractively: "This is the ordinary wine, so if I have a bucket, the price I give is five gold coins a barrel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What!?" Among the eight elders, there were five or six elders who jumped out of their seats. In the past, the price of such a barrel of wine sold to the dwarf kingdom was only 50 gold coins. This price of Richard is exactly the same as the sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bam Moore was also extremely surprised, but silent. If the average wine is at this price, then the price of the other three grades does not have to be asked. After the elders were amazed, Ba Moore asked, "How much wine did you bring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "In me Within the logistics team, there are 20,000 barrels of ordinary grade wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand barrels!" This figure, even Bamore is moving. This batch of wine can completely let the whole dwarf of Furnace Fortress drink for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then continues to say: "The finest and medium-sized wines together have 5,000 barrels. But the best spirits are only ten barrels. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balmore's chest undulating a few times, shocked by the amount of wine, said loudly: "Very good, Richard! In addition to wine, What did you bring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard is simply: "Food. Barley, wheat, oats and corn, a total of 3,000 tons. This is just The first batch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Bamore jumped directly from the throne, and his voice screamed like a thunder in the King’s Hall: “It’s food. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food." Richard is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it food?" Baal Moss looks like electricity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't it be food?" With a beard, Richard laughed particularly fascinatingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barmore strode down the ladder and stood in front of Richard, suddenly stretching his arms! Richard bent down and hugged with Barmore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hug of the king is a sign. At this moment, Richard was truly accepted by the dwarves of the furnace kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Furnace Fortress is large in size and can hold up to four hundred and fifty thousand dwarves, but now it is the dwarf population of the entire furnace kingdom. The dwarf population is sparse, mainly due to food constraints. The pale high climate is very cold, and only some valleys can produce food. Since the dwarves have been driven from the plains to the barren highlands, food has become the biggest problem. It was only after the dwarves dug into the depths of the ground, found a large natural underground cavern, and then found an edible mushroom that relied on the heat of the melt to partially solve the food problem. But even if all the available caves are full of mushrooms, they can only feed so many dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hug of a true sanctuary is as heavy as a mountain, making Richard almost breathless. Hard, Barmore was loosening his arms and said, "Lee, my friend, what do you want from the Furnace Dwarf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this The problem, Richard also prepared, said: "I need metal, ore, dwarf weapons, muskets, and of course gunpowder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;巴Moore’s eyes flashed and he laughed and said, “Richard, your appetite is really big. But this is what you deserve, with the friendship of the furnace dwarf, you will not be disappointed!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the nobles are all happy, and Bamol’s promise is that almost every word is worth a box of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the second war of the line, these nobles also asked Richard to bring so much wine and food as a transaction to the logistics unit. solution. Wine is a traditional trade between humans and dwarves, and a weapon for exploiting dwarves. The dwarves are barely able to withstand the wines that humans brew. But food is different, it is cumbersome, difficult to transport and store, and has limited value. Many people can't figure out what this thing can do. But in front of this scene, the representatives of the nobility understood the meaning of food. It comes in exchange for the true friendship of the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel the joy and envy of the nobles behind him and admire the gaze. This is not how far-sighted Richard is. Any patient and meticulous person who has investigated hundreds of dwarf slaves from the pale highlands will have an understanding of the living conditions of the dwarves in this land. In the human kingdom, there are a large number of dwarf slaves, and the blood-stained land has a large number of dwarf slaves captured from the pale highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting information is not difficult, but there are few people who want to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Bamore held a grand dinner to welcome Richard and his followers. Specific trade details, such as the price and quantity of the traded goods, naturally have Oral to talk with the dwarf elders with the noble representatives who are proficient in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Richard and the quicksand stayed in the royal palace of Bamore. Nothing happened overnight. The next morning, the sands asked Bamol to visit the holy temple where the dwarves sacrificed their ancestors to pay tribute to the glorious deeds of the dwarf ancestors. This requirement has of course been approved by Ba Moore. There have been more than a dozen heroes in the history of the Furnace Kingdom, each with its own deeds. Bamore is deeply proud of his ancestors, and is willing to let the ancestor's prestige spread among the friends of the aliens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the dwarf is deeply buried in the depths of the mountain, a magnificent building complex, the main hall is up to 50 meters, the center is a huge furnace, constantly from the furnace The hot metal is poured out from the mouth. The molten iron was poured into the casting pool in the middle of the main hall, and there was a constant amount of molten iron poured into it. The molten iron in the casting pool was not much and many. Around the furnace, there are more than ten dwarf statues in different shapes. Even Richard can perceive the faint aura of the statue's surface, indicating that the dwarf ancestors represented by these statues all reached the level of the spirit. If any statue is moved back, you can make a sacrifice alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
