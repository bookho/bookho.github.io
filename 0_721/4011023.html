			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I just miss a witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A mighty team entered the transmission array and then appeared in the transmission hall on the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a crowd of people in the hall, they are all looking at how Richard is going to ask the Turan family. The direct conflict between the two major floating island giants, although often appeared in the past, is rarely such a high level, so direct confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the transmission line leading to Turan Floating Island, stood a whole row of Tulan family knights, and watched the transmission array behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed knight shouted: "This is the floating island of the Turan family! Today the floating island is closed, no one is allowed to enter the floating island. It is best to consider the creation law of fascist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many nobles listened, and they all had a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called creation law of Fu Shide is actually a few basic rules that must be observed in the operation of this city. These include special occasions where you cannot use force at will, such as the Eternal Dragon Hall, the Floating Island and the Transit Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tulan family sent a team of knights here, if Richard directly killed, it would obviously violate the rules of creation. Violation of the consequences of the vassal creation rules may lead to the attack of fait. Where the rainbow can shine in July is the scope of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulan and others gave Richard a problem because Richard had an hour of overnight. Of course, Tulan can't hide in the floating island forever. They will come out sooner or later, so this is a loss sooner or later. But delaying the time, at least it is a small pull back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is obviously totally different from everyone else’s. He didn't talk to the Turan knight leader at all, just raised his hand and pointed forward. More than a dozen night elves immediately stepped forward and took off the thunder behind them. This time, they are carrying six tubes of Thor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the knight’s leader suddenly stretched, his eyes almost burst out, and he only yelled “No!” and his voice was deafeningly roaring. The sound is drowning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen Thors squirted a long flame tongue, and every time they spit, the opposite target would be missing a body. In a blink of an eye, more than a dozen Tulan family knights were completely shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring sound finally passed, and the entire transmission hall was silent, leaving only the humming sound of Raytheon still in the spinner's barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the flesh and blood of the Turan knights and walked into the transmission array. Behind him, Achilles, the Star Sage, and numerous night elves rushed into the transmission. Then a large number of lively aristocrats rushed into the transmission array as they woke up and entered the castle of the Turan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floating island square, the Duke of Turan is standing at the other end of the square, facing Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! You are insulting Turan, insulting the floating island giants of the entire Holy Alliance! Our Tulan family will never be unfounded because of you. The accusation handed over the important members of the family. I demanded that the House of Lords re-examine the matter in accordance with the law of the Holy Alliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facing the Duke of Turan The roar, Richard is just sneer, and the hand slowly presses the arbitrage of the ruling: "So, you are not going to pay someone? I said, if you don't pay, it is equal to Akmen. De declared war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Turan is not afraid of Richard’s threat, screaming: “Don’t imagine that Turan will yield under the threat of your war. Even if you are the emperor of the Holy Alliance, you can't treat the lord with full autonomy in this way, so treat the floating island giants of FSTA!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling is just Slowing out the sheath, Richard has lost interest in continuing to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Duke of Turan and said seriously: "Lord Duke, you made a mistake that should not be made. When a family came to me one after another After two black hands, I really didn't have the interest to see that they still existed, and there was a chance to play the third black hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Turan suddenly chilled He finally realized that Richard was not threatening, and every sentence he said was serious. Because of this, the Duke of Turan has a heartbeat at the moment, and there is only one thought left in consciousness: "Licha is crazy! He is really crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When When the ruling was completely detached, the Duke of Turan finally screamed: "Here is the floating island! You can't attack us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Duke’s voice seemed so pale at the moment, and the ruling had already faltered at the Duke’s speed at a slower pace. The gushing knife gas rolled forward, pushing all the way, completely crushing all the buildings and people on the road ahead, and even leaving a deep gully of more than one meter deep on the floating island body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with two slashes, more than a dozen red and blue horror fireballs floated on the ruling, fluttering to the floating island throughout. These fireballs seem to have no weight, no physical body, and pass through all obstacles without any hindrance, flying to the intended place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one and another huge fireballs vacated, forming a mushroom cloud in the air, integrated before and after, and finally gathered into a fireworks A huge fireball between the two, squatting into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is wide open, watching the huge fireball that has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave pushed the unprepared Duke of Turan to the ground and rushed to the dazzling aristocrats. But in the end, the defensive power field set by Richard was blocked out, and it was saved to look at the face of these hilarious guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s move is also a bit redundant, and the aristocrats’ expressions are more sluggish and sluggish, and there is no calm and calm style. In fact, they did not blame them. When the Duke of Turan climbed up from the ground, he looked back and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is in front of the Duke of Turan. Castles, gardens, military camps, hills, treasure houses, everything, all disappeared out of thin air, leaving only a piece of scorched earth. The ancient floating island that has been carefully examined for hundreds of years is like never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Duke of Turan knows that he is not dreaming, because a small part of the floating island is intact. That is the square at the foot of Richard, and the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you..." The Duke of Turan pointed to Richard and couldn’t speak at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Richard’s attack is honest, and it’s still within the acceptance of everyone. After all, in terms of power, there are also Su Helun and Philippe. Above Richard. However, Richard actually destroyed the floating island of the Turan family, which is really shocking! Isn't Richard not afraid of the rule counterattack from the legendary city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard slowly stalked the ruling, and hundreds of souls came together and were inhaled. On the entire floating island, except for the Duke of Turan, everyone else turned into a fly ash in the horrific attack. The power of continuous explosions, even the Sanctuary strong can not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Turan finally reacted. He pointed at Richard and suddenly laughed: "You dare to destroy the floating island! Faust will kill you, It will completely destroy your soul! No one can resist the power of fait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be annotating the words of the Duke of Turan, suddenly shot in the sky The next bunch of colorful light shines on the entire floating island. The huge magical atmosphere began to surge, and before this huge magical power like the tide of the sea, all the nobles felt that they were so small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"July Rainbow! is the Rainbow of July!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is destroyed, we Run away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclamation is one after another, originally held The nobles who came to see the lively mentality were all gray-faced at the moment, and they did not expect to suddenly encounter such a thing. But at this moment, the rainbow's light has enveloped the entire floating island, and the transmission array has lost its effectiveness. All the space is imprisoned, and no one can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the hysterical Duke of Turan and said with a little pity: "Unfortunately, the power of fait is not as irresistible as you said, no matter now In the past, in the future, there are people who are not afraid of the power of ukiedue and can ignore its rules. As for me, it is another situation that you will never think of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;July Rainbow, no, it should be a June rainbow, and the projection is getting stronger and stronger. In the light, massive amounts of energy smashed, turning into hills, lakes, grasslands and forests, gradually restoring the floating islands to their original appearance. That was the original ecology of the floating island before the Tulan family entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No killing, no attack, Favord skipped this step and began to repair the floating island. And the Duke of Turan felt that his authority was decreasing, and the rebuilt floating island began to vibrate, then broke away from the original track and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
