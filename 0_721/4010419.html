			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the square in front of the temple and looked up at the top of the temple The tall-tailed ivy-like tower is this tower of miraculous towers, taking away Lina, what kind of race can leave such weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A costume knight hurried out of the temple and came to Richard, Shen Sheng said: "Li Cha, the enemy in the temple has been eliminated You can go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and crossed Lina and walked into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is magnificent and majestic, and the overall height is nearly 100 meters. The upper hall is nearly 50 meters high. The style inside the hall is bleak and simple. There are obviously two buildings. Different styles, the hall does not know what kind of material was built, there is no pillar in the whole hall, the walls are deep black, exuding the metallic luster, and the faint lines can be seen on the wall. On top of this wall, an altar was set up, and a spiral staircase was built to the upper level. The spiral was also stained with blood, and more than a dozen bodies were neatly placed under the wall on the side of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first went to the body and looked at it carefully. From the color of the service, these people are the waiters or priests in the original temple, not special The warriors, they are extremely fiercely resistant, each person is covered with wounds, and in the temple, there are more than a dozen temple staff who are there, guarded by several costume knights, these people are full of gaze Panic and fear, even the servants of God, not everyone can do anything to ignore life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say anything, but turned to the spiral staircase and walked all the way to the upper floor of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder was built with a generous atmosphere and a rich Shulan style, but Richard saw that the escalator, the altar and many of the attached items in the bottom hall were Different from the style of the temple itself, it is obviously added later, and nothing else, the metal surface that is treated extremely smoothly in the main body of the hall is not the level that Hughan craftsmen can achieve, even in Noland. The skilled metallurgist needs the magical power to handle the metal surface to such a smooth level, but the metal treated in this way can be imagined at an expensive price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder is all the way up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hall is divided into three levels. The middle floor is the warehouse and the place where the priests rest and live. The upper level is the real core of the whole temple. On the upper level, the battle is extraordinarily fierce. There are traces of blood and weapons. Here, we can also see the original difference between the main body of the temple and the later construction of the Shulan. No matter how thick the buildings attached to the Shulan people, almost all of them can be worn by the two sides of the fierce battle, and sometimes even collapsed. The main building of the original temple was very hard, and the full force of the knight could only leave shallow scratches on it. From the material point of view, the metal texture of the entire hall was built on the Lafite iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, there is a long and wide corridor, and at the end is a gate with two holes. Richard walks into the gate and enters the room. The hall is lit with dim light, and there is a strong bloody smell in the air. There are three people in the temple wearing strange robes. They are now in the pool of blood. When they look at their clothes, Richard knows that these three people are The three gods with the highest status in the holy city of Shulan, the Three Gods, apparently also passed a fierce battle, but they did not fall to the ground. The battle in front of the temple was dominated by the knights, and the three gods were dealt with. It was made by Axiris and Senma, and the blood paladin and the dark priest were not the first to fight together. They had a special tacit understanding. They had a common feature, that is, they could kill the enemy, but they Say nothing can die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Gods are whispering at this moment, twitching from time to time, consciousness is clear and sober, sometimes painful, Achilles is around them Busy, always use the unclear magical technique on the Sanshen, and Senma walks over to Richard and says, "This is the three gods of Shulan. When we came in, their own power has been consumed. Most of the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first looked around the entire hall, which is the same style as the bottom hall, the most striking is the huge round table of several meters in diameter in the center, this It is a round table made of metal, engraved with a large number of unclear words and many patterns, but it is that Richard does not know the words, and it is even less clear about the effect of the patterns, those patterns and any known magic. The array is different, and when Richard looks at it, there is a feeling of no clue. This shows that no matter what the text or the pattern, there is no connection with the magic knowledge he has learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard fell on the three gods. It seems that the secrets of this are broken. It is also necessary for these three people to cooperate. At this time, Asi Rees stood up and said, "When it's done, these three guys will definitely die for a while, and can handle it at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was not willing to waste his time on the three gods. He directly turned back to Naiyou and said, "Take it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai Yu Wan Ruo Ling As usual, the whole body twirled with a faint mist, with a plain voice: "Reassured, I will let them say everything that should be said and should not be said."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai Youben is a very beautiful girl, with a mysterious atmosphere around her body, but when she said this sentence in a constant voice, it made everyone feel chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris leaned against the wall and whistled to Neiyou and said, "Be careful, don't play bad."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou stopped and looked at Axiris with black and white eyes, faintly said: "This is hard to beat me, or worry about yourself, Little guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Achilles’s mouth twitched a bit, and the smile suddenly became extremely ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t see any movements in Naiyou, she just went to the middle of the three gods, and the Three Gods immediately cried in great pain and hurled. But what is strange is that no matter how they roll over, they can't get out of that small place. After a while, Naiyou said: "You can ask now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard asked for half an hour and the Three Gods had exhausted their vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already said everything they know, and the last moment of death, it’s not relief, but extreme fear, everyone is watching for the first time. In the process of torture to the soul, many people have subconsciously kept a distance from this strange girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Three Gods died one by one, Richard did not ask where their souls went, only to have such a fearful expression, he looked at him slyly The dome of the main hall, after a while, said: "Let's go to the cemetery and bury Lina there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tradition of Archimonde, the warrior will prefer The bones are buried in the battlefield of their own death, and the soldiers with Akmon's blood and qualified conditions, even if they die in the outer domain, may automatically generate a tombstone belonging to him in the family cemetery, but this is not absolute. For example, the Tomb of Tottenham has not appeared on the graveyard of the Archimonde family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone had no objection to Richard’s decision. Instead, he followed Richard through the entire top of the temple and walked over a long aerial bridge to the most sacred cemetery in the Holy City of Shulan. This is a landscape. The sloping land of the painting, the mysterious force keeps the cold winds of the mountains outside, and constructs a small world of green trees and grasses. A mountain spring flows through the slopes and flows into a deep bottomless In Tanshui, in this small world, there are dozens of small pavilions of different styles, but also beautifully hand-made. Each pavilion is a cemetery. The pavilion has a brief introduction to the people buried here. Everyone's introduction is very simple, just to mention some of the major achievements of his life, but if it is based on the standard of Hulan, these are all earth-shattering events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only ones who can be buried in the Holy Sepulchre are the three gods and the holy city warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and was very satisfied with this place, so he told me: "Move these tombs away, I don't want anyone to disturb Lina." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight and the followers work together, and in the blink of an eye, the memorial pavilion inside the tomb is removed along with the graveyard below. After the mysterious power, the memorial pavilion and the tomb below it moved away, the excavated land slowly closed and restored the beauty of the green grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li selected a place of satisfaction, ready to bury Lina here, everyone dug the cemetery, put Lina in the tomb, according to Kemond’s tradition was held in a short ritual. Finally, Richard placed his hand on top of Lina, silently, and dropped a small red flame from his hand, slowly falling on Lina’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flame with the power of Richard’s real name. When it falls on Lina, it keeps burning. Everyone bows their head and sings. Archimonde's old and desolate war songs, the war songs are unusually short, the melody is low and the crowd sings over and over again, as if returning to the wild age, a scene in which Archimonde struggled to survive in an extremely difficult environment. It seems to be in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is finally extinguished, there is no longer a dragon master in this world, only a trace of gray marks left in the tomb, above the holy city, the red dragon is long The long cockroach, hovering for a few weeks, tore the space and disappeared into the depths of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning to the end, Richard stood quietly, without tears, and the rest of the followers did not cry, even Achilles and Senma in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
