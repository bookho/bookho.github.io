			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha returned to the study and quietly looked at the entire Noland The map, contemplating the next strategy, go to Calando, and the vengeance of his sacred dynasty is not small, only to see the sacred tree dynasty to be so bloody, just to exchange for a few fragments of Midarun, It can be seen how important these fragments are to them. In the plan of the Holy Tree Dynasty, it can be seen that the Son of God is equally important. Now at least the plan on the Son of God is completely destroyed by Richard. How can the royal family of the Holy Tree not be angry? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous enemies of Richard, such as Schumpeter, Mensa, Joseph, and even Welling, their strengths are not added together or holy trees. The dynasty royal family and the holy church of Shenghui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the face of such a huge enemy, Richard has no fear, but in the deep hatred, but also raised an irresistible excitement, he His eyes have always been on the border line between the Holy Alliance and the Holy Tree Dynasty. The terrain is complex and there are many nobles. The large, medium and small families are intertwined, making the politics of this region extremely complicated. Today's allies are likely to be tomorrow. The enemy, the vast territory of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, the political map is constantly changing, and there will be great differences in a few years. In recent years, most of the layout changes here are with Ellie and Soram. The Duke was related. Before she became a companion with Richard, Alize had independently changed her title from the Viscount to the Earl. Now she and Richard are closely integrated and receive constant support from Richard. For more than a year, Richard has already given Ally to two thousand fully armed cavalry, and has armed another 5,000 troops for her, and Richard's own Archimonde Knights and more than one hundred knights are ready to go. Aid, Logically, Alizee's strength has been enhanced more than twice, but her progress was not much faster than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason is that the small aristocrats in this area are afraid of her sudden increase in strength, many of them are united, and even some of the past enemies have temporarily laid down their disputes. Another reason for dealing with Ellie is that Ellie is not willing to over-display the edge, so as not to cause a full blow to the Holy Tree Dynasty, so she always controls the extent of war within the scope of regional conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha repeatedly weighed the gains and losses, and finally felt that the risk of launching a full-scale war against the nobles of the sacred dynasty was too great, and now his rear is not stable. Many branch families are only temporarily attached to him. Once a major defeat in the war, Richard’s title of the new king of Archimonde will be shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Richard sighed heavily, ready to give up the war at this time, and the war with the holy tree dynasty, won without much benefit, but the consequences were quite serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s double eyebrows suddenly rose slightly, faintly said: “Come out, still hiding what to do.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure appeared from the shadow, and then drifted into the study from the window. This is a man wrapped in a black robe. His face is completely shrouded in the darkness. What it looks like, but he has a rough and fierce momentum, like a general who has been killed from a thousand horses, not like a killer who sneaked in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the study and walked silently across the stage, standing between Richard and the weapon frame, Richard’s extinction, sacred killing and The elf long knife and the destiny twins are placed on the weapon rack. The man’s action, the meaning of hostility is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him, his eyes suddenly spurted like a flame, and the man snorted, slammed his black robe and floated up on his body. The strange force field blocked most of Richard's insights, but Richard still knows a lot of information, including his general vindictiveness. Men's vindictiveness is between the sanctuary and the legend, and the nature is hidden. Containing the power of time, this is one of the most obvious features of the Knights of the Eternal Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already counted, so he asked: "Is there something to do with me? If you want to do something that is not pleasant, I advise you to give up this idea. I left immediately, and my mood was very bad recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man spoke up, his voice was hoarse and ugly: "You don't ask who sent me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "If you ask, you will not say it, even if my enemy sent you, it is nothing, they are from In the shadows, I attacked me just because they knew that there was no chance of winning in a positive confrontation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled and said: "You have strong confidence. But let me first see if your self-confidence has considerable strength to match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the talk, the man has more than a short sword in his hands. Really rushed to Richard, the short sword came out, and the original gray-flooded sword front suddenly lit up a large golden pattern, which is the man’s vindictive attachment to the sword, which has already shown its essence. The effect of Richard’s heart is a slight glimpse. The vindictiveness that can be materialized is either extremely strong or has special power. Such sacred strongs are one level higher than the ordinary sanctuary. Among the people who are called the strong, there are also a few who are unable to reach the realm of fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard had no sword, but he reached out his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand is already bloody, and there is a little red light on the fingertips of the index finger. As Richard waves his hand, his fingertips A half-meter long blood-colored front appeared in front of him, and hit the dagger silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-sword instantly casts a layer of blood, and then the piece is broken. There is only one hilt in the man's hand, and the man is holding it all at once. Keep the action of holding the sword in front of the sword, look at Richard, then look at the hilt in his hand, and then look at Richard, so many times, he only took a breath and said: "Great destruction Strength, this is your real name ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly lowered his right hand and inserted the bloody floating right hand into his pocket, without answering the man’s question. Instead, he said, "Now you can talk about your intentions. I don't think my enemies can move the high-ranking knights of the Eternal Dragon Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That The man smiled and said, "You are very smart. It is called by Vatican. Let me bring you a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands, There is a time hourglass in the hand, but unlike all the hourglasses that Richard has seen, this hourglass is actually purple-black, and the hourglass is silently broken and spilled. Purple spread out, over the whole study, Richard suddenly floated a strange feeling, just like in the eternal dragon temple sacrifice, so he knows now study actually being in another time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin’s figure appeared in the study. She looked at Richard and said, “Richard, I can only talk to you in this way because The next thing I want to say is that I can't say it. You have to remember every word that I said, because I can only say it once. Before I left, I left this thing to me, saying that it was I found out in your exclusive plane that I have been studying for a long time before I have parsed out a lot of rule information from it, but it is enough for me to confirm that it is the doomsday mark."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dooms of the Last Day." Richard remembered that after getting the thing from the statue of the God of War in the Highlands, Liu Sha said that it was probably the doomsday mark, but she did not explain what was next. The mark of the end of the day, just to take that thing to the past, said to study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the deepest part of time and plane, there is a mysterious race, some people call them looters, others call them reapers, no matter what they are called They have all been proved to be related to the destruction of countless planes. Once they appear, they will completely invade the target plane, and in a short time they can conquer the entire plane, and then the plane will be dragged into the darkness, out of eternity. The range of divine power of the Dragon of Time has become a part of the dark region. After thousands of years have passed, no one knows where they are coming from and where they are going. Even if they are not the same race, we can confirm that Once a plane becomes their target, there will be some doomsday imprints in that plane. The doomsday imprints are not all the same, but they are prophecies and precursors, because their appearance indicates complete destruction. Therefore, in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, these things are called the Doomsday Seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
