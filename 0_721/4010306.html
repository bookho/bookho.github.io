I need to re-correct her. It takes about a week or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of twilight is not too great for Richard’s power. Loss, so Richard did not care too much. He was more interested in Zonghu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the mother’s nest said: "If the owner is not with you, If you use it, please hand him over to me. As long as he has him, I will no longer have obstacles when I advance to the ninth stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine-order" Richard is surprised and happy I remember that the mother's nest has just been promoted to the seventh-order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the owner recently added a lot of nutrients and also swallowed a lot of strong people, so the door to the eighth-order has been Open, I have already started the process of evolution to the eighth order. This process takes about three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately said, "What do you need?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the "Zonghu and Food" Brood is very straightforward<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can be if the Zonghu does not If you are obedient, then he is yours." Richard answered in consciousness<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, a small-scale camp was built on the beautiful Cangqing Tianchi Lake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of bonfires in the center of the camp. A group of followers and knights are sitting around the campfire and roasting the big fish from the Tianchi. Diffuse The beasts that have been seduce to many nights, but these beasts dare not approach the camp instincts to tell them that there are many terrible guys who let them fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a camp, Zonghu was sitting on the ground with some boredom. Looking through the open account door, the people who were talking and laughing under the bonfire had a complicated look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No one cares about Zonghu and puts him in the camp. Zonghu is now weak and even weaker than an ordinary person. Even if he wants to escape, he will never go far.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Neiyu walked into the camp and sat down on his knees and handed a grilled fish to Zonghu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu You are not welcome to take the grilled fish and eat it. The swallowing action is fast and fierce. It has been like you haven’t eaten for many years. The big fish that weighed a few kilograms disappeared in the Zonghu mouth. The tongue licked the long rod of the steel rod used to wear the fish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born with a beautiful movement but rude as a barbarian is a shock A very strong picture<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie quietly watching Zonghu Zonghu suddenly his body shook his head and said to Neiyou: If you look at me like this, I can't eat anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie whispered: "You will be reassured by others within my sight"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger is staring at Nai’s gaze and gradually reveals a breath of breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp However, Naiyou is not afraid of it but a smile that is distorted and creepy. "I know what you are, but you can't know what I am. I only tell you that your ability was not useful to me. You are the same, but now it is different. I have changed my identity, so I am very interested in treating you often. Would you like to try it now?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu face micro I changed my voice and did not answer the question. The steel arrow in the hand was directly plugged to Naiyou and said, "Is this fish enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neilou Turning out of the camp, when I came back, I had a raw fish in my hand and threw it to Zonghu. "Do it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu screamed Standing up and staggering to the nearest campfire to start roasting fish<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pile of campfires sitting next to Philen and several knights, they were a little surprised I saw Zonghu’s glance but saw Nai’s beside Zonghu’s body and didn’t think that only Fen’s eyes looked at Zonghu’s eyes. Something seemed to be a little scary.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai You did not know where to get a fish and roast it on the campfire. She looked at the flame of jumping and suddenly said: "You don't seem nervous at all"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger smiled and said: "I want to be nervous. I have been interested in people who are interested in me or hate me. But no one is willing to kill me. They are all thinking about how to use me. Are you not the same? Still very valuable, I want to help you to do things for you. I don’t have to pay enough price, I will do anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai’s humor suddenly disappears strangely I laughed and said: "We can be different from those you have met in the past. As far as I know, there is already a existence that you absolutely don't want to encounter. I have a strong interest in you, so I advise you not to ask too much. If you regret it, you will regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu’s laughter attracted a lot of attention and he said: "The person who said this to me There are also many, but they are ultimately regretted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly replied: "That's because you are dealing with waste is not how powerful you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu’s pair of eyebrows locked together The humiliation made him have a strong murder. He couldn’t wait to dismember Nai’s immediately. However, he immediately remembered that Nai is just a treatment and he was suffering. If it is a more powerful cure, he can directly put himself down so she is qualified to speak like this. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Zonghu still didn’t think it was because he saw from the eyes of Richard that the leader of this group was very interested in him and believed that the other party would know more about his origins. Interested in <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard rushed out of the camp to see the Zonghu on the side of the campfire, and did not expect that the Zonghu actually seemed to have been with himself. The men were smashed together<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sent a beckoning to Zonghu and Naiyou, saying, "You should come over and talk about it now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was free to find a camp to sit down and sit in his opposite camp There are Naiyou and Liusha who have strong restraint power against Zonghu<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu walked into the camp and saw the eyes of Richard suddenly jumped from Li In the depths of the eyes, Zonghu saw an alternative interest as the chef looked at the ingredients.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Zonghu was settled, Li’s eyes suddenly spurted a faint light. Zonghu’s body hair suddenly screamed and screamed from the ground. However, he did not know when he stood behind him and pressed his shoulders on Zong’s shoulder. Pressing him back to the original place<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall are all good at the official fighting techniques as the Guardian of the Heavenly Guardian. The standard of <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard’s eyes moved up and down the Zonghu, and the Zonghu almost felt that his heart had stopped beating. Feeling extra pain even made him lose control and involuntarily want to scream, but Naiyou constantly sent his power into Zonghu's body and completely smashed all his mobility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the light in the eyes of Richard’s eyes disappeared, and Zonghu felt that he had experienced a long time and had experienced such a scene. The arrogance of the Zonghu had disappeared. He had finally believed in Nai’s. Richard is really different from other people<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Zonghu. The recent war temple is all over the night and you are rewarded with a legendary sword as a reward for your life." Richard said <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu nodded his face and said with a sarcasm: "They said that I stole the divine nature of God of War. This is really bad. It can't be a bad excuse. God of War. Sex is that God of War sent his godhead to me in front of me. I will never want it, but they said it, how can it be that the big gods who have been through the Temple of War in the past have already died in my hands? They can also get a few big priests. Those cardinals can't come to chase me personally. Is it because my injury is too late to turn to the temple to dare to chase me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "I heard that the new Pope in the Temple of War and you have a deep hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Michelle Is the little guy supposed to be the son of the old guy who is right? He is the only one who can sit in this position. Of course he will hate me because he is old. During the week when the guy promised me to act freely, his mother and two aunts died." Zonghu smiled and said his devil's behavior<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no anger or preparation to condemn his expression. He just nodded as if he heard a trivial message. He said, "I know now you need to convince me to see how I can kill you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
