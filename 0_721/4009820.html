			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the base interrogation room screamed like a pig. The voice of the pastor Ma Wen is extremely high and bright, and from the screams can also reveal the strong foundation of singing God. Unfortunately, his god is not very high, so old, it is only a three-level pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wenxian cursed Richard in a loud voice, then bravely expressed his devotion to God, and then later sought for mercy, followed by a simple scream, and finally quieted down. The whole process is less than three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Richard, the five-minute set of techniques is for the veterans who are physically strong, and used in the pastor, I am afraid I can really have him. Old life. And obviously the priest does not have the firm will of the veteran, so even if the sand can cure the injury on his body, in the end it is possible to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-minute shrinking version seems to be just right. When Richard puts Marvin down, he can immediately hide in the corner, holding himself and crying. The sound said: "What do you want to know, I have said it all! There is really no more, even the things of the temple I have said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In the end, he actually burst into tears with his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet." Flowing sand said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wen immediately stopped crying. In his heart, the hands-on Richard has not been continually brushing the sinister sand of the micro-injury treatment. It’s this beautiful and chilly girl with a stone that makes him want to be fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up straight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wen immediately bounced from the ground and the back was firmly attached On the wall, you can't be more straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have I used a few minor injuries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8!" The text answers without hesitation. After answering, he wanted to understand the meaning of the eight micro-injury treatments, and involuntarily trembled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head, obviously now that the sand is more controllable than him, so he went to the cleaning tool silently. But when he turned around, he heard the sand flowing behind him and said, "Reach, give him another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't!" Marvin yelled, Rushing to the sand, it seems that I want to hold her thigh and cry: "I said everything, I will do it! Don't come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sand drifted back a little, just letting Marvin's hug, then bent over and bent his right index finger to his mouth, making him a snoring gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Marvin’s screaming abruptly, keeping his hands in a hug, and stiffened there like a statue. The faces of two people are only twenty centimeters apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand of the flowing sand raised his head, and Marvin slowly nodded, although he certainly did not understand the meaning of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow sand pointed to the wall again, and Marvin immediately returned to the original place, standing on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you willing to do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Ma Wen is extremely determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Shunkou agreed, Ma Wencai felt Some are dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop? How to surrender? He is the pastor of the god of courage, and now he is only three. If you betray the courageous god, his priest's rank will be reduced, and even his magical skills will not be used. What is the use of a priest without magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wen immediately wanted to go deeper. These invaders from the ectopic face have always been the natural enemy of all the gods in this plane, at least the god of courage. enemy. Even if he changes his faith now, it is too late. If there is a god in the ectopic face, it is difficult for the power to penetrate the innumerable planes. How many years did he work hard to return to the third-level pastor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Marvin’s face is not the same. There is no difference between the first level and the third level priest. They are all waste, but the degree is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted to Richard and smiled and said: "Look, he has surrendered, it is easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt a black eye. It is very easy, very easy, and the problem is too easy. It is natural to say that the verbal commitment is credible. However, the sand should have the following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the sand gave Ma Wen a piece of paper, let him paint the god of courage on paper. Ma Wen’s face is different, but he dares not to obey, not only draws, but also comes with a trace of divine power that he has come to pray. This is the complete sign. In the face of a pastor who can quietly put eight treatments and minor injuries, he did not dare to play any tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand handed him a piece of paper and told him: "Let's read it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing a few lines of paper on the paper, Marvin’s hand was shaking and his face finally became pale. He looked up at the sand and looked at Richard. This time, Richard's fine tool with blood finally played a role. Ma Wen bowed his head and his face was bleak, and he read it in a trembling voice. That is a passage written in the word God, and in each plane, the gods are almost identical. As a pastor of the god of courage, learning the language is also Marvin's first homework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is the most vicious curse of the cursing god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the power of my soul, here vows... will abandon your so-called glory and abandon it in the land of filth..." It was trembling, and just after reading the last sentence ".... to testify!", he suddenly became weak and his face turned into an abnormal flush. The whole body's divine power was burning, and the burning pain was not as good as Richard. The penalty can be quite different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvin is just a third-level priest. If it is around level 10, then the burning power will burn him directly. In the identity of the original servant, the most vicious curse on the gods served will inevitably cause God's attention and attention. It can be said that at this moment, Marvin received more attention from God than he could have in his lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Liusha opened the book of time in his hand, and a beam of light was shot from the page, and a flowing golden sand was drawn in front of Ma Wen. When the sand gives off a light and majestic atmosphere, it is a high spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let abandon consciousness and take on all the new gods with your soul. What you see is that you will worship forever." The sound of flowing sand is majestic Supreme, Marvin, who was burned by the power of God, couldn't stand it anymore. He squatted and prayed loudly toward the flowing sand. His prayers had just been exported, and the sand was turned into a golden light, rushing into Marvin's body, and then turned into a cool, crushing the boiling fire in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
