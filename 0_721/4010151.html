With his current strength, identity and status, no matter how much he wants a woman, whether in Nolan or Faro. And with the further improvement of his strength and power, the chances of getting a girl like this level will also increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa can give Qi Qi as a bargaining chip to the Duke of Bear Peter, that is, the benefit of annexing Xiong Peter is far greater than that of Qi Qi. This is the simple and clear logic between the nobility. And Richard himself thinks that it may not be as good as the Duke of Peter Peter, but in the near future, how can the Duke of Peter Peter compare with him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Richard’s idea and a common perception among the nobility. However, Qi Qi is indeed special. She succeeded in breaking the understanding of many people, including Richard. Otherwise, in the original plan of Richard, it is prepared to humiliate her. In the fight against Mensa and Schumpeter, Richard has already made up his mind that the means are all-or-nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under Richard’s sharp eyes, Qi Qi still stood quietly, without leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee turned cold and said faintly: "Don't you really want to happen with me? Then I will not refuse."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 sighed and said, “Richard, do you really want to let me go back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you thought, now, if I go back, what kind of end will happen?" Qi Qi said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your reputation, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 floats a bitter smile Said: "How could it be so simple? After this gamble, the Duke of Peter Peter was greatly humiliated. According to normal practice, he should lift my marriage contract. Then I will return to Mensa, as a family shame. The symbol has become a plaything for someone or somebody. My body may also become a bargaining chip and tool for exchanging certain things. But the Duke of Peter Peter will not do this! He has no retreat anyway, and is destined to be sent to Mensa. Swallowing, so he will definitely continue the marriage contract, and may even ask for an immediate marriage, so that I can get it completely. At that time, all the memories I have in the Bear Peter family are probably all kinds of insults and abuses. If you ask about it, you should know that the Duke of Peter Peter has the hobby of killing girls. So when I go back, I will only have two endings, become the playthings of the Mensa, or become the playthings of the Bear Peters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard admitted that she said It may become a reality. Unlike her, Winika is still a secret to her. Moreover, at least the nominal controller in the department of Gordon is Richard. Richard’s heart is not in a position to find joy, nor can other people in the family turn Vinica into a plaything. But there are many other members of the nobles, and this kind of thing is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard did not speak, Qi Qi looked at Richard and sighed: "Why me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard's hand, smiled, "You are at the scene." Then the color said: "Because you are the best choice, you can strike both Mensa and Schumpeter, especially Bear Peter. When you are an opponent, it is best to abandon the biting dog first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi said: "Yes... but I want to ask, can I choose the third ending?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third ending? Talk Look." Richard was surprised. She has not only brought an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 said without hesitation: “Let me stay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No change, ask: "Leave? What identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪的平静 calmly with firmness: "Whatever identity. Maid, prisoner, The evader, or your lover, bed partner, can. But I only accept you. If you let others move me, then I will commit suicide. Because there is no difference between this and going back."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally showed a hint of helplessness with a bit of sarcasm and said: "I don't want to be a plaything of Mensa and Schumpeter, but want to be my plaything? It seems that I am getting It’s a big trouble to come back. Ok, let’s talk about your real thoughts. If you want to stay, what is your best way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪豫豫After a while, I said seriously: "I am very smart, I also have some magic, and I am awakened by the blood. I hope to get a position through these things, not through the face and body."<br /><br /> &n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "You are very ambitious, but this idea is also very unrealistic. Change one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qi Qi’s face was pale and her teeth said, “Then add my face and body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally nodded and said, “This is almost the same. I am qualified to get my shelter. Well, let's go ahead, I will let the butler arrange you. You can live on the floating island first, and I will return to the Faro plane tomorrow, when I come back next time. Think about how you should be arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 said: "You can take me to Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Richard looked up and down at her and said faintly: "No, I don't want to bring a burden, and the plane is very expensive. Everyone knows that we are poor." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Richard pulled the bell ring, and the old housekeeper came in. Li asked to find a place to live with Qi Qi. In addition, whoever asked for the person to leave, let the old housekeeper leave with Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study was finally quiet, and Richard sat at the table and began planning to return to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he has to sort through the gains. In terms of income, Maple Amber is 7 million, three sets are set to 3 million, plus ore and metal, which are exchanged for 1 million and hundreds of thousands of weapons and equipment, and the fraction is given to the old housekeeper to maintain the floating island and territory. The operation and the cost of recruiting troops. Four hundred pieces of forged black scorpion weapon were exchanged for enchantment at the expense of one hundred pieces. After one month, Richard would get a full three hundred pieces of knight-level weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard got the equipment from Noland to be able to arm a thousand of the most elite knights, at least for a while, he was not equipped for the time being. It’s awkward. Even if it is counted to evenly equip the two hundred sets of Knights of the Duke of the Wolf, Richard can still have eight hundred sets of equipment. This is the production of the mother nest for nearly two hundred days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s process of calculating the income is very slow, and his mind will float on Qi Qi from time to time, and some of them are inadvertently made, but let The scene of a person spurting blood. A picture with a strong impact is lingering, making Richard's efficiency very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in a quiet bar in Faust, Raymond was sitting in the window, watching the seven-stringed moon slowly moving from the side of the sky, swallowing some bitter spirits. The wine was as strong as fire, and the entrance was burning, and a line of fire was ignited from Raymond's throat to the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Raymond poured himself a large glass of spirits, suddenly one hand reached over and pressed his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is not alone in drinking, opposite him, sitting in a robe with a hood. The low-hanging hat occludes most of her face, and she can only judge from a figure to be a woman. She said in a slightly hoarse voice: "You can't drink any more, unless you want to die within three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled and said: "Now Isn't it more painful to live than to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman said slowly: "Today, you could have intervened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intervention? How do I get involved? Even if I can stop Richard, can I send Qiqi back to Mensa and let her fall back to Bear Peter’s hell? ??" Raymond's eyes are red, like a beast. Even if he was already full of alcohol, he couldn’t say it clearly, but Raymond still kept his voice down, so that the voice could only be heard by the mysterious woman opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Raymond’s sorrow. Even if he wants to drink wine, his body will not be able to withstand it before he gets drunk. So whenever Raymond’s mind is always awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rudely broke the woman’s hand, then poured a large half of the spirits into the scorpion and spit out a sip of alcohol, saying: “I understand She, just like she knows me. She is a very smart and very thoughtful girl. I know that once she goes to the floating island of Archimonde, she will definitely find a way to stay. No matter who she is, always It’s better than going back to the old metamorphosis of Schumpeter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman looked at Raymond and drank another glass of wine and suddenly said, “I can help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me? You are crazy." Raymond heard her, and immediately laughed, but the laughter was sad and sad. Look at the end of Kane Mensa! Our emperor’s majesty finally revealed his fangs, and the meaning of the expression is not clear enough? This time, the duel gamble, he does not allow anyone to intervene and must perform To protect the dignity of the royal family. Do you want to fight against the bloodthirsty Philip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman is speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face she hides under the hood looks very young, at most as big as Raymond. For these younger generations, no matter how amazing they are, the emperor’s majesty is a behemoth that cannot be violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After venting, Raymond looked calmer and sighed and said slowly: "In fact, after all, I still have no power to protect Becky. If I It is possible to let the Joseph family fully support me, and perhaps change the fate of Qi Qi. But now I have only a few years of life, and no patriarch of any giant will be for a younger child who can only live for a few more years. Going against the giants like Mensa, I don’t even have the value of doing business with Mensa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fate can change! Now go to Ake Mond is still there," the mysterious woman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late." Raymond shook his head and then looked out the window and took a sigh of relief. He said, "In fact, this may be what she always thought." The opportunity to change my destiny. I can't help her, maybe... can Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
