			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard instinctively holds the knife and wants to use the back of the knife to shoot the little guy who is unclear to the ground. But she shouted but let Richard stop the action in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was suddenly, the little figure slammed into Li Chahuai in. She is not big, but her strength is amazing, and she will throw Richard to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the little girl in her arms, she was about seven or eight years old, with a dark red wave lang long hair, a lot of big eyes Red, like a melt is flowing. This is a very beautiful little girl, so that Richard has a feeling of deja vu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha instantly found the source of the sense of acquaintance, lost the voice: "Fleier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The little girl smiled very sweetly and cheerfully, and took the lead to force her in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has returned to God. According to time, Freire has not been born yet, and it is still a baby when he gives it to his mother’s nest. Has it become so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, what is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, this is what I said Surprise. I have successfully expelled the part of the soul of the temple that belongs to the scholar's mage. Now the Highness of Freire is completely your daughter, and there is no impurity in her soul."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how did she grow so big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest sighed in a rare way, saying: "I intended to stimulate The blood of the small hall is to resist the soul trap of the scholar's mage, but she did not expect her growth rate to suddenly increase by more than 100 times. Now three days is equivalent to the other children's time of one year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked closely at Freir's body and blood, and found that he was safe and sound, and that he let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fast-growing race was not uncommon in ancient times. There are many powerful races that can grow in less than a year and then survive for thousands of years. Legend has it that some ethnic larvae have just been born and can swim in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of time, Freire completed the growth period, she will stop such high-speed growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved Freire’s problem, and Richard also put aside his mind. However, Richard immediately became curious and wanted to know how the ancestor expelled the soul fragments hidden by the scholar's mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, this is very simple. The scholar wizard named Jin Fala covered the will of Miss Freire with her own consciousness. If it is a long time, under the small hall The will will gradually die out. At that time, Jin Fala can completely replace the soul of the small hall and occupy the body under the small hall. But he also has a consequence in doing so, that is, everything that the small hall will endure will be borne by him. So I I used the method of dealing with Zonghu on Jinfala. The difference is that I put the small hall in the absolute dark and absolutely silent space. Besides touching the sound of blood flow and heartbeat, he will touch again. It didn't take any other sounds. It didn't take long for Kim Farah to go crazy, and then I was positioned in his hiding position and expelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately remembered The method used by the mother nest to deal with Zonghu was to repeatedly pump away the blood of his body, and then let his body recover to create new blood and then drain it. If it is finally to torture the Zonghu who is the son of the gods to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of the hen’s nest is not as many times as it was in the past. It can stimulate Freire’s body and allow her to quickly generate blood. It is conceivable that the process of producing blood will certainly not be pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest regrets: "It is a pity that this Golden Farah is too tossed and mad. I have not been able to find much memory from his soul." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. One day, we will be able to get rid of these scholars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell At the mother's nest, Richard directly called the messenger and flew to the battlefield on the 1st. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Freire, he stays in a turbulent place for a while, it is safer, and she can eat too much, and eat more things every day than other children. There is more to consume in a year. It is more convenient to feed her in the nest forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, the Brood built a wormhole portal in the battlefields of the No. 2 and the 2nd. Richard left the battlefield on the 1st and returned to the blue water oasis city with more complete facilities and materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Richard did was to transfer the Medusa head that Romney used to redeem points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this head has been processed by the magic workshop masters, which can directly stimulate the regular forces inside and form a magical soul. Or she can make her a powerful magic item. However, if you do magical props, you can use three powerful petrochemical gaze, and then you will run out of energy and lose your effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to kill legendary magic items has been too many. But since this head is in the hands of Richard, it is naturally not so easy to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee placed Medusa, one meter long, on the bench and ordered everyone to leave the lab before it started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If another more knowledgeable mage is present, you will find that Richard is not trying to inspire the rule power in Medusa's head, and then to construct a magical soul. Richard is directly capturing the remaining soul of Medusa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Medusa’s snakes suddenly withered, her face as clean and picturesque, and her face was creased and ugly. In the hands of Richard, there was a yellow ball of light, in which a small Medusa was seen in the east, trying to escape from the ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Medusa is exceptionally strong, so the soul remains very complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After observing for a while, Richard inhaled the light ball into the body and then entered the semi-planet Star Library, with the help of the ancient experimental platform. Analyze the rules. In the evening, the rules contained in Medusa's soul have been fully resolved, and her soul has turned into a perfect and powerful magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this magical soul, Richard can create a fifth-order structure called a petrochemical gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This build is no worse than the fifth-order magical arm. If you don't use this magical soul, but use it to copy a new magical soul, you can reach the level of the medium-fifth-level structure, and the petrochemical gaze power is slightly lower, but it can also cause some inconvenience to the legendary strongman. If the Sanctuary wants to be petrified, it needs strength and luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability combines killing and control, exceptionally powerful and practical. In the next five days, Richard couldn't sleep, and made two petrochemical gaze in succession, which made him relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in the next three months, the point redemption system will retain a strong enough appeal to keep the strong players in the battle of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing the embers of the structure, Richard shuttles between the battlefields, smashing the piles of reaper wreckage with blue fire, collecting the essence of the embers . Perhaps the reaper also noticed the actions of Richard, suddenly shrinking the front line, and no more fighting units appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha will not be polite, while continuing to refine the reaper of the reaper, while constantly sending reconnaissance beasts or strongmen to the north to explore the control of the reaper region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation suddenly became calm and quiet. But everyone knows that the longer the period of calm, the greater the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calmness makes every strong who participates in the Faro points battlefield start to be uneasy. But they have experienced two big battles at the moment, and everyone has accumulated a lot of points. After a big fight, many people's points can be converted to the level of artifacts. At that time, naturally, there is a battle of infighting, but there are three whole artifacts of the exclusive Faro integral battlefield. The chance of succeeding is much greater than the other two integral battlefields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, these strong players weighed, although they knew that the next attack of the Reaper would be difficult to resist, but the people who finally gave up actually had only two ordinary sanctuaries. Their strength is the bottom of the strong, the competition artifact is hopeless, and there is a great danger, so they finally choose to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just take another war. Many people think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is quietly passing through the unbearable death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of Archimonde are silently preparing, and the strong players participating in the points battlefield ushered in the traditional carnival, and the first point redemption Opened, the list of the next issue will be announced after the redemption is completed. This has formed a convention. The strong people harvested on the exchange day, and then planted the seeds of hope on the list announcement day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohme looked at the leaderboard as usual. This time there was no accident, and all the legendary strongmen were firmly on his head. However, his total score and score level are still above the sanctuary of many heavens, and even more than two legendary powerhouses. This of course benefits from the Medusa head that he exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
