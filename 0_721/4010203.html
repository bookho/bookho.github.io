But the unicorns behind Richard's eyes gave a golden glow, and a pale gold mask protected the followers of Richard. All the lightning strikes on the mask and disappeared. Just to maintain all followers quickly through the magic zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-magic is one of the characteristics of the unicorn. In the forest environment, the ability of the unicorn seems to have a bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the thunderstorm, Richard and others have reached the foot of the tree of life. Standing here looking up, you will truly appreciate the greatness and grandeur of the tree of life. Richard took a brief look at the information transmitted by the elite human knight, and pointed to the tree top and said, "Let's go! The important people are there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a group of followers attacked the passage like a wolf. The five knights in the formation formed a battle, guarding under the tree, defending the elf warriors who might come to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is burning with war, just imagine that Richard is forced to cross the thunderstorm and attack the tree of life. But he can't go, the royal guards can't get through. The durability of the Thunderstorm is the greatest feature of this magic, and it is the only standard to measure the magic of a great magician. Pamir is clearly full of magic, and the thunderstorm has lasted for a whole minute, and there are no signs of a stop. The elves in the storm have suffered heavy casualties, and now they have become obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s here, suddenly there is a voice from Richard in the distance: “Master Pamir, watch the placement of my fireball, prepare for magic coverage!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pamir said that he was lifted up and saw a fireball rising from the tree of life. He crossed the distance of 100 meters and slammed on a tree house at the top. In wet weather, the fire waves fired by fireballs are dim and dim, and the lethality is greatly reduced, but there is no problem in the collapse of a tree house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the top layer of the canopy ignited a layer of green shield that completely blocked the fire. This is a strong natural defense, but it has pointed out the goal for Pamir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamir stabilized the floating state and began to recite the spell. The lengthy spell took a full ten seconds to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is awkward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large electric light emerges out of thin air, pouring down like a waterfall, pouring it in a place where natural protection is lit. The green-green shield is desperately flashing, flickering and fainting, and it can break at all times. The electric light blew through the eyes, but it didn't end there. Instead, it turned into countless electric fire spiders crawling around, covered with the surface of the natural protective shield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural protective shield finally couldn’t stand, it burst, and countless electric fire spiders rushed into the shield and landed on the nine elder elders below, 狠狠 狠 电力 电力 狠 狠 狠 狠 狠 狠 狠 狠<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine-level magic thunder forest, the power is extraordinary. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After smashing the natural protection supported by the elf elders, the remnant of the Thunder Forest still adds a lot of damage to the elders. When the electric fire spider disappeared completely, Pamir had pale face, crumbling in the air, had to fall back to the ground, and was immediately protected by a royal guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of Richard is still attacking quickly, and Tiramisu is the first to open the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogres who have blessed wars and countless gains of magic have more horror than horror, and there are always elf warriors rushing out of the tree house to stop. The ogre does not look at who the other person is, what weapons are used, but just mention the chain that has a few hundred kilograms of weight. There is nowhere to dod on the narrow boardwalk, and the Elf Warriors either step back or dodge, and there is no third way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flow of sand, Richard protects her, although the sand does not need protection. At this time, a fairy warrior suddenly appeared in a seemingly uninhabited tree house next to him, holding a short wooden spear and a spear to stab Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles, always. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these green elves choose the target between the sand and him, it will be unlucky. Taking people by appearance seems to be a common problem for all Green Sens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took a step back and was able to let a spear of the Elf Warrior, holding down the spear in an understatement, and gently pulling it outward, immediately Let the Elf Samurai lose its balance, squatting out of the wooden house, and slammed into the edge of the wooden road to barely stop. Richard reached out and pushed it gently on his lower back. The Elf Warrior finally couldn’t help but take a step forward. This step was in the air, then shouted and fell down. It is only 50 meters from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a wizard warrior strikes, Richard does not entangle with them at all, but directly throws them away from the tree of life with superb fighting art. . Falling from a height of tens of meters, these elf warriors are not dead, and it is difficult to fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directed the followers to make a full assault, even if it was a minor injury. There is a stream of sand in the ranks, which is equivalent to an extra life for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the top of the tree, the paved road suddenly vibrated, and a huge warrior screaming out from the corner and rushing to the team! This giant bear is different from the ordinary beast. It has a green tree mark on its forehead. This is not a beast at all, but a druid in a bear form! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu stopped running, his feet squatting, squatting slightly, ready for a violent collision. The giant bears that have changed from the high-order Druids, the power and even the ogre must be treated with caution. Richard can imagine that the Druid elders who were hit by the Thunder Forest are rapidly recovering. Every delay of one minute will result in more variables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the order of the singer, and the unicorn behind him suddenly hoofed, and a golden electric fire flashed on the unicorn. A tiny golden lightning suddenly appeared in the air, and instantly hit the giant bear that rushed! The green light of the Druid's long-aged giant bear was immediately dissipated under the golden lightning. Then the giant bear spread out and the whole body was stiff. It turned out to be paralyzed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden lightning is not strong, but the negative state is fatal. As we all know, the elves and Druids who control the natural forces are the least likely to be negatively affected, but this high-order Druid is easily paralyzed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paralysis continues for a short time, but on the wooden path around the tree of life, it is no worse. The giant bear squats on the smooth wooden road and slides toward the tiramisu in the role of huge inertia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre is overjoyed, and the round is chained, and I want to give this scalp thick and thick giant bear a loose bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't delay time!" Richard sighed. Even if this giant bear has been paralyzed, it will take a lot of time to kill him. Druids are notoriously difficult to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre immediately changed the tactics, first smashing a chain on the giant bear's head and letting it whisper. However, the ogre made a full blow, but still could not smash the skull of the giant bear, showing the thickness of the skin. However, the next attack by the ogre was to fly a foot and kick the oversized bear to the outside of the wooden path. Then I heard the anger of the bear cub falling quickly, and then there was a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage that falls may not be fatal, but it takes time to climb up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, crossed the tiramisu, and quickly rushed to the top of the tree. It has been ruined by the Thunder Forest, and all the tree houses are destroyed under the horrible destructive power of the 9th level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two elder elders who have stood up and are holding what the natural rod is calling. Most elders continue to release healing spells to themselves, and the two weakest elders can't climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately unfolded the book of the bearer that had already been caught in his hand, and a flash of lightning fell from the sky, squatting in a man who was casting a summoning spell. Elf elders! The elf elder screamed, and the whole body was entangled with electric fire, and he fell. Has he ever seen the release of magic without warning, and let it go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stubborn head of the Greenwood Elf stuffed with wood, this is simply illogical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning landing, popping up more than ten small lightning bolts, crawling randomly on the ground. The power of the small lightning was not small. A Druid elder could not dodge, was hit by a small lightning bolt, and immediately fell down painfully. After a few seconds, I struggled to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh-order magic chain lightning, although not as terrifying as the lightning spiders derived from the 9th-level Thunder Forest, is by no means hard of these Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to flip the book of the bearer, and another lightning bolt hit another elf elder who continued to summon the spell. The elf fell to the ground without suspense. Richard’s heart sighed, if he changed himself and saw his opponent’s ability to instantly send magic, he would never continue to sing a spell like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Druids began to transform, and the two elder elders struggled to start blessing natural demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the giant bear that was about to form, and said: "Tiramisu!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre came out and took a big step, rushing away, smashing into the newly formed giant bear! The huge impact made the giant bear fly over ten meters, flying far from the top of the tree of the tree of life, and then screaming and falling. Although the ogre was also knocked back a few steps by the huge recoil, then the legs sat soft on the ground, but he laughed happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha once again flipped the book of carrying, and a chain of lightning fell, once again will be busy treating other elder elders of Druid down. In the desperate eyes of the Druids, the books of the books are flipped again, as if they never see the end of the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole seven raptors appeared out of thin air, and even Richard was shocked. It seems that this position has a great strengthening effect on the magic of the natural summoning class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
