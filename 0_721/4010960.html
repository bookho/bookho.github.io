I can be sure that no matter how many people come, I will let them come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice was very dull, but Mecks suddenly chilled. She suddenly felt that some of her breathing was not smooth, and she always had an inexplicable faint fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear comes from Richard, she suddenly found that in just a few months, Richard has changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex feels that walking around is not a young and thin young wizard, but a dragon with the power to destroy the mountains! Just looking at Richard, let her have a feeling of depression that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and turned his eyes to Mex, then nodded and said, "Good talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is getting farther and farther, and gradually there are fewer even scouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the changes in the surrounding, Richard’s army is always moving in accordance with the established itinerary. Richard and the knights lived together, but they became more and more silent, and sometimes it was hard to say a word all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mex, who is following Richard, is increasingly reluctant to approach Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible pressure of Richard is getting heavier and heavier, it seems that only Mex can feel it. Later, she even looked at her from afar, and her chest would be like a huge stone, and even her breathing would be difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex, who has the golden moon and blood, has excellent perceptive abilities. One day, she suddenly knew what the pressures that Richard had sent out, and that was the pressure generated by the power of the rules! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the change of the pressure, Richard almost every day, the control of various rules will climb to a new height! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than a day to make Mex feel shocked! So she bit her teeth, resisting the shudder and fear from the depths of the soul, and following Richard to move on. She wants to be a witness to history and will never allow herself to miss such an important moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in Richard's consciousness, the wisdom talent is running wildly and constantly parsing a rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mastered the runes of the stars from the ancient star family, plus the Noran gods and chaotic gods, he has the order The ability to look at the world from three perspectives: chaos and neutrality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The omni-directional perspective allows Richard to speed up the analysis of rules, and now he does not have to analyze the rules of the real world, just unblock it from the library. The ancient syllabus is enough for Richard to be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has already unblocked the remaining seven books, except for the book that introduces the history of the stars, the remaining six records are all supporting one position. The rules of passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star family is obviously derived from a powerful plane that is higher than the Nolanland level. If the rules system recorded in the six books is placed in Noland, Both are close to the level of the underlying rules of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard does not need to parse the rules for the time being, but to fully study the power of the rules contained in these six books. This made his wisdom talent jump to the next level in a short time and jumped to the eighth level. The speed of learning is naturally much faster than the analysis, which has caused Mex to exert tremendous pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the bloody journey gradually extended at the foot of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, when the miracle peak that supported the entire legendary city of Faust appeared in the field of vision, the ogre lord couldn’t help but lick his chest. Both heads are screaming through the clouds! Then it held up the double hammer and slammed it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth immediately trembled, and the cracks screamed and continued to extend far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre lord is not excited, but depressed and angry. It has been going for a full 30 days and can only advance more than 100 kilometers per day. In such a repressed journey, there is no battle at all, not even one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it heard about the ancient history of the blood journey, it was such a bloody boil. The heroes of that generation broke through the obstacles and finally stood on the legendary city and began to belong to their own legendary stories. The legend is so fascinating that they all touched the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Tiramisu felt cheated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Island giants are coming from the blood road, but in the eyes of the ogre, they are not a hero at all, it is a group of scammers and cowards! Thirty days, until the end of the blood journey, came to the foot of the floating world, did not see them appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of these giants constantly trailed, mobilized, and chased. A line of defense was placed around the front and rear of Richard, surrounded by circles, but when Richard approached, They will all withdraw in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one core reason, and no one wants to be a person who directly faces Richard. This kind of drama happened much more, and the giants even felt a little embarrassed, and they no longer engaged in the farce of these exercises, and all the troops were withdrawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard reached the end, this march became the only bloody road that had not bleed since the tradition of bloody journey. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, in the face of Richard Chi-Chi, the floating island giants of the big and small, no one dared to fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the eternal plateau, Richard looked around and saw that the mountains in the distance were so steep and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time you were here when you were young, it was once again in your heart. It’s just that the people who brought themselves and the people they want to see are now gone. At the bottom of the endless abyss, what is the deepest part of the world, Richard can never imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard felt that perhaps one day he should go to the Abyss abyss, which is known as the deepest part of the world, to have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood journey ends here, or the part that belongs to the average person is over. Richard's Qianqiu construction completed their mission. Next, it was the battle of Richard himself, which belonged only to him and the indefinite battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perception of Richard extends through the power of the rules around him. He felt that the space was changing, and that a person was walking through the void and flying to vagrants at an incredible speed. That is no fixed, she came back on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard slowly opened his eyes, raised his head, and straightened his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone suddenly felt that there was an electric flash in front of them, and the whole world seemed to be brighter! And their feelings began to become disordered, it seems that the whole world has become strange at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the witnesses in the team and following, the heavenly sanctuary and the legendary powerhouse are instantly changing, they know why they suddenly feel that the world has become Unfamiliar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's because the rules of the space around them are controlled, they even become very difficult to touch the rules, let alone use the power of the rules! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has reached out and the moonlight, the ruling, and the Great Flame are automatically flying into the hands. He clipped three artifacts to his knees and said to Gangde: "I will go up first, and you will camp here and wait for my news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard slowly floated and reached out and sketched a few times in the air. A portal opened out of thin air, and then his figure disappeared in the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence around it. After a long time, someone suddenly said, "Is it not possible to use the portal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Like, probably" another person murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Fauvist, you can't use any transfer spells. It's common sense that only floating islands and specific areas in the city can build large transport arrays. Although common sense is not impossible to break, it can never be broken by ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the floating kingdom palace, a portal suddenly appeared, and Richard walked out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely the hall of the Holy Alliance emperor's deliberation, but this hall is rarely used when it is indefinitely inherited. As he passed through the hall, Richard flicked in the shadows, and he walked through the palace in this way, and soon he came to the indeterminate sleeping hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dormitory was once a place of yín chaos and blood, but several batches of male and female pets can not make unsatisfactory satisfaction, but after being killed all, no fixed I have never called a new pet here. But a touch of blood stasis still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
