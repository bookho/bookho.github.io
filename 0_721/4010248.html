The tree of life speaks of course: "The spring of perseverance still needs me to consume the accumulated life energy. So under the premise of maintaining the scale of the elves, I will try to produce the spring of permanence as little as possible, and let the elves rely on the laws of nature. To breed the race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so treated to me?" Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Tree replied: "Because I need to prove that my value is greater than a simple tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Richard praised: "very smart! Well, now is the second question, this world is very conducive to the growth of plant life. Then whether your growth rate can be accelerated, is it possible to advance to the world tree? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of this tree of life is actually a trembling and excitement: "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "If possible, I would like to see if I can help you grow into a world tree. Of course, the premise is that you are loyal enough and can prove that your use is greater than the world." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of life was silent for a while, then slowly said: "First of all, in the current forest area, there can only be one world tree. Once the world tree Formed, then the entire forest area will be affected by it. The most important thing is that there are several powerful natural enemies of the tree of life that can be the world tree Driven. So when a tree of life grows to a stage close to the world tree, the existing world tree will drive all kinds of natural enemies to cull the potential tree of life. If the tree of life can resist the attacks of natural enemies, And grow into a world tree, then there will be an endless war between the two world trees, vying for the rights of the field until one is dead or moved away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You said that the tree of life itself does not have the ability to defend itself. You need to rely on the elves to protect you?" Richard continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The elves will help us to drive away the natural enemies, and they also need to rely on us to grow and grow. The size and strength of the elves are determined. Whether we can grow further. The tree of life can be divided into young, growing and maturity. In addition to the young, the growth and maturity are divided into three stages. I am currently in the early stage of growth. I originally attached to my elf. The tribe is not strong, I may need to wait another hundred years before I can move on to the next stage. When the protector is not strong enough, I am afraid to advance, because once the promotion is successful, there will be a new powerful immediately. The natural enemies came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "If I say, I can give you enough protection, how long will it take for you to be promoted?" To the next stage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been in the early stages of growth for nearly a hundred years. If I don't have to think about the external environment, I can enter the middle of growth within half a year. Then If I can get through this safely The natural enemies of the stage will only take about ten years from the middle to the end. But I must remind you that my natural enemies in the medium term are the crows, and their individuals may not be very strong, but the number is very large. There will be tens of thousands of people at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth of the tree of life makes Richard feel surprised, it seems that this plane is the main means of limiting the growth of the tree of life. It is their natural enemy. After listening to the answer of the tree of life, Richard felt that his idea was very feasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where can I find the crows?” Richard needs to know more about this natural enemy. The most detailed and real way is to catch only the live, and then use analytical skills analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves know the characteristics of the crows, you can let them capture. I believe they will be able to give you results soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and finally asked: "What changes will you make after entering the medium term from the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More springs of perseverance, every eight years, the fruit of a tree of life, the branches of the natural cane become five, and finally the scope of my will to reject the forest can reach 150 kilometers." The tree fully understands what Richard wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and stood up: "Well, you are ready for the promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the tree of life is gradually fading away, and Zhu Bu. The spirit of the wind falls helplessly on the ground and has lost consciousness. This time, Richard and the tree of life have been communicating for too long, and the young Druid has been difficult to support. When Richard picked him up and placed it on the rattan bed, he walked out of the tree house and called the elder elder to let him try to catch a few crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a small group of elf hunters disappeared into the forest, returning in the evening, bringing a dozen crows, half life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a medium-sized bird, each one nearly one meter long, the most striking is not the hard black iron feathers, but the body In terms of proportion, it is a bit too long, like a small sickle, and occasionally it will flash a yellowish light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Elf Hunter demonstrates the power of the Woodpecker for Richard. Its sniper is lightning fast, and most people can’t dodge it, and it’s extremely powerful. Even if it is a hard scale wood, its 30-centimeter mouth can be inserted into the majority of the mouth, and then pulled out, the jagged mouth will produce several grooves in the wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment of the soldiers under the watch, whether it is the plate armor or the tower shield, most of them can not resist the crow's glimpse, it is a small hole. Only the fine-level equipment with defensive attachments can stop their sniper, but they will also be filled with pits in a short sniper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail feather of the crow crow is also a terrible weapon. When it is gathered, it is as sharp as a knife. When it is unfolded, it is a flat blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is slightly gloomy, and this kind of thing comes with dozens of them. The goal is small and it is not difficult to smash. But when the number reaches tens of thousands, it becomes extremely scary. He can almost simulate the scene of the large black-pressed crows, which is no less than the throwing power of the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current strength in Green Forest, if thousands of crows come to deal with difficulties, another thousand will be fleeing. However, according to the tree of life, the number of crows coming to the evolutionary stage will be tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that special arrangements are needed to advance the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li thinks for a moment, let the soldiers close all the crows caught, and all the green slayer captives, and when they are ready to go back to the base city . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took care of the rest time and meditated in a tree house that was preserved in the upper part of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his consciousness gradually became silent, the vision formed by the spirit and the soul began to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the soul’s vision opened, Richard was shocked! At this moment, he was in a completely strange meditation realm, surrounded by endless light-colored life, just like sitting in a warm pond of life. This life is full of life to a near-pure world, as if it was touched by that meditation at the Archimonde of the Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His consciousness does not need to be chased deliberately, and a random fishing is a breath of life, a little traction will enter the body, one touches the magic star world tree The branches and roots that are spilled out will be inhaled into the magical world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an endless stream of life into the magical world tree, no longer a small piece of sporadic absorption in the past, but a direct influx! After a while, the magic star world tree suddenly trembled, and sprinkled countless stars from the canopy! The star-shaped condensed by pure star power wanders and dances, some are absorbed by the blood of Archimonde, others are absorbed by the blood of the other four elves, and the rest enters the body of Richard, and the magic is dissolved. One! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter the magic power or the blood power, it grows at a speed that is visible and tangible. This feeling of power expansion is really fascinating. God fans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no exception. He almost greedily absorbs the breath of life around him, and it is not interrupted for a moment. Although more than half of the energy is lost during the conversion process, the successful conversion of the starburst is much faster than usual. And transforming the breath of life into a star power, it is also very good for the further growth of the magic star world tree. A considerable portion of the energy that has been lost on the surface is actually absorbed by the Magic World Tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was sucked up by Richard, the surrounding life was always rich and almost never thin. He gradually forgot the time and was completely immersed in the world of power growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only his magic is improving rapidly, but also the blood of several branches is also eager to move, especially the elemental world tree that has never had a chance to make a living. Vibrate, and forcefully capture every star that floats from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the position of Greenson, Akmon’s blood is calm, like a sleeping volcano, and all the elves’ blood is bursting out. Brilliant vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time unknowingly passed, and finally the elemental world tree has absorbed enough stars, after a fierce tremor, the original blurry backbone It starts to become clear. I don't know where the energy comes from the roots, and gradually becomes materialized, shaping the backbone of the world tree. The tree of the elemental world tree is constantly changing in different colors, and at the top of the trunk, a bare branch grows up with a red-hot leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the elemental world tree was formed, the tremors it provoked to awaken Richard, freeing Richard from the boundless power of growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless power of inexhaustible power to make a request for beauty, almost let Richard not want to wake up, like a pair of invisible lingering arms want to drag him and sink again . Fortunately, his will is extremely firm, and once consciousness returns to the real world, it will soon wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops, when is it now?" Richard slammed his head and got rid of the last trace of confusion, and found that he would ignore the passage of time. But at this moment, the second consciousness gives the answer: five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
