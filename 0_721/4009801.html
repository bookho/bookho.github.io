			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard sipped a half pot of spirits and heat in the abdomen When I got on, I finally felt better. I struggled to stand up and said, "Don't make a noise! ​​What about Oral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for it! Just now He heard his voice over there.” Gangde immediately took the job and hurried to the depths of the woods, and escaped from the embarrassing situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and shook his head, and told the several knights who were still standing to check the battlefield. The two ogres were assigned warnings to prevent them. There are more enemies hidden in the forest. Their natural and keen sense of smell is the perfect choice for sentinels. But even if there are enemies, it should be just a few remnants. Rough statistics, there are more than 50 elite warriors killed in the battle, which is almost the limit of a jazz can afford. The strength of the high-ranking Jazz himself is actually so strong that Richard is surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sand has been completed and went to Richard. Her face finally looked pale, and Richard stared at her and said, "Your magic seems to never run out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back at Richard, he asked in the usual indifferent tone of the clergyman: "I just saw an adult summoning four violent wild boars. Which fourth magical gift is the special gift given to you by the god of magic? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth-order magic natural call can call out one or two violent wild boars. If there are other bonuses, the limit is three. If there is no special reason, it is the big devil. The instructor could not call the fourth wild boar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smirked, decisively not entangled in the excesses of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield inventory ends soon. Including the high jazz, the enemy killed 69 people and seriously injured 10 people, only two of which were still complete. A total of 70 elite warriors have far surpassed the strength of a jazz. In Noland, a barren barren in the territory is just about this strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Oral was also found by Gangde. The poor elf bard has two arrows in it, and he has been seriously injured in a coma. Fortunately, the quicksand actually uses a final power to release a powerful treatment to save his life. The ten stepping knights who followed Richard came to death and killed three seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The materials sent this time were also found, two boxes of armor, a box of weapons and a box of magic tool materials. Richard immediately opened the box and armed the survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was trouble in interrogating prisoners, both severely injured and slightly injured, but from their screams, they can still identify some Information, such as the ectopic intruder's alarm comes from the gods, and then the high jazz is only the advance troops, and then the coming lord is a baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Richard encountered an organized and premeditated cofferdam, so when the portal opened, almost everyone was under siege. The entire team was immediately disbanded and caught in the dilemma of fighting each other. If not everyone who took this time has a good ability, it is possible to be fully shackled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart was a haze, turned to look at the sand, her eyebrows tipped slightly, the enemy here had a firm belief, and the real god Oh, it’s not good news for the gods. Of course, for Richard, it is also very troublesome, which means that the trial will take some effort. But this is not the most important thing at the moment, there is another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about our forward base?" asked Li. He finally came out of the portal, the original portal should be opened in the transmission base, but the result is in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a stepping knight who distracted to scout the surrounding environment rushed back and said, "Richard, find the forward base! But, but... There is no one inside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base is less than a kilometer away, and the knight is unclear for a long time, Richard So I decided to go and see for myself. If there is something that I don't understand, the sand will probably be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you really stand in front of the forward base, not only Richard, but even the indifferent sands are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called forward base, in fact, is similar in size to the village, but with a sturdy high wall and three arrow towers that can be seen and guarded. But even through the retaining wall, you can see the tall stone spires in the center of the base. The spires are engraved with complicated patterns. If you look closely, you can find an hourglass pattern in the pattern. At the top is a square fire tower, which should be burned with a time flame that does not go out all the year round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time lighthouse for the road to the latecomers and the most important building for this forward base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the entire forward base is silent, quiet and irritating. The flames of the time lighthouse that should have been eternal burning have been extinguished, and it is not known how long it has been extinguished. The gate of the forward base is wide open, and you can see dozens of houses of different sizes. Some of the houses are half-closed, but there is no activity in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to get in and was caught by the water. The girl took the ‘Sleep Guider’ and jumped up the wall, looked inside for a while, sniffed and sniffed, and then nodded, and then jumped into the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is already a left-handed shield, with a huge axe on the right, striding into the main entrance of the base. After Gangde, the ogre three-pointed to catch up, while Tiramisu gave a three-pointed magic shield and stone skin surgery, which finally reflected the true color of a magician. Until almost everyone entered the base, Liusha relaxed his grasp of Richard's hand, but still grabbed his sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not that important!" Richard said with a smile to the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you die, the water will die, and everyone else will be downgraded." Liu Sha said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, this should be the problem I am worried about?" Richard tried to argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the glory of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, your god is now above me, so I can't let you die." Flowing sand is still serious Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha cried and laughed, so seriously said with the same seriousness: "But I have no habit of letting women stop in front of me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the tradition of Archimonde?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is it." A simple question, Richard answered very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the sand did not persist, but released his hand. It was just that Richard had just stepped forward a few steps. Five or six magical techniques fell on him like rain, with shields, magical resistance, long-range defense, detoxification, and continued vitality. For a time, the radiance of the various magical techniques on Li's body continued to shine, and the unspeakable gorgeousness, such a luxurious blessing, he just wanted to die and it was somewhat difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
