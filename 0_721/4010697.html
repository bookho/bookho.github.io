			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville stared at the map for a long time, his fingers suddenly on the map It’s the shortest route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately summoned the generals, ordered the troops to advance at the fastest speed, and must reach the boundary line within two days, then the whole army raided, even if the battle to the last person It is also necessary to kill 30 kilometers from the deep red Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clouds, the black-tailed eagle was drilled again. In its eagle eye, the army on the land was slowly accelerating and rolling toward the boundary line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-tailed eagle screams and flies away, disappearing in the clouds in the blink of an eye. After an hour, the black-tailed eagle flies to the boundary line. Here, the air is hovering over a brain, the black-tailed eagle flies near the brain, passes the information seen to the brain, then turns and flies away, hangs over the brain, constantly and other After the moment, hundreds of different kinds of birds and animals appeared in the sky. If there was a dark cloud, the black pressure rushed toward the direction of the black-tailed eagle, and it was about to reach the summit of Allenville. When the army was in the army, the various birds of this kind were scattered and all the tens of kilometers were monitored. No matter how the division of the slaves below, they would be under their surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville looked up into the sky, sneer, the generals were looking up at the sky, if the first black-tailed eagle It just looked a bit weird, and these strange birds were completely abnormal. A general was sullen and asked: "These things are all released by the Crimson Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Those are the eyes of Richard." Salenwell said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals stunned: "Really, how can we fight this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We grab the time, unless the army of Richard will fly, otherwise, we have a great chance to win." After that, Saranwell waved forward, the army slightly accelerated the speed, straight to the deep red The Principality ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Saranwell’s marching route has been transmitted to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals who assigned the mission at this moment have already led their own, and most of the followers and knights still stay in the blue water oasis city, Richard will Saranwell’s marching route and speed are marked on the magic map, and he stays in the followers of the combat room, and Wing, Sandro, and Clarkton, who have been armed with war, frowned, and Sharonville At the current rate, up to 20 hours can reach the border of the deep red Principality, and Richard can accumulate no more than 5,000 troops in a day, and more troops can take more than a day to arrive. On the battlefield, the question is whether the 5,000 people can guard the attack of 50,000 enemies without any danger and no way to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Saranwell’s empire is elite, and although the troops placed on the border are the elites of the war, but as the strategic maneuvering force, there are very few knights, but the humanoid knight is only two hundred rides. The contrast between the two sides is such a disparity in power that makes the failure of the border forces inevitable. Even the length of time that can be delayed is questionable. When the number of super-precision combat units in the mother’s nest is not enough, it is the case when Richard personally directs. Under the comparison of the military strength of the three, it will also be very difficult. The command of the battle of Salenwell is by no means a weak one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the ability to mobilize 5,000 people is only a theoretical figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the magic map for a while, then drew an X on the map, where is the point where Sharon Will entered the deep red duchy. The assembly point of the border forces of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers are somewhat military literate, and Shalwell is taking a straight line, so many people see the position where Richard draws X. What they don't know is that when drawing X, the orders have been passed through dozens of brains and sent to the border. After a while, the soldiers who have prepared for a team leave. The camp on the border, at full speed to the scheduled location, and a 500-person team stationed at the scheduled location, began to fully expand the original Jianying camp, and built a simple fence around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turbulent land, nearly a thousand birds of different sizes and sizes flew out of the worm nest, gradually spread out and became huge fan-shaped, flying To the Iron Triangle Empire, the more they fly, the more dispersed they are. When they cross many human kingdoms and enter the Iron Triangle Empire from the south, they will form a warning line that stretches for thousands of kilometers and thoroughly scout all the flying land. Behind them, following more than a dozen brains, the situation of reconnaissance can be passed to the rear in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the middle of the turbulent land, two huge nests of up to hundreds of meters are slowly opening, like the tide-like human knights, but they are all I found my own ride, and then arranged neatly in the open space. Every thousand people are a team. Once the collection is completed, they will lead to the turbulent place and the border of the deep red Principality. Two temporary mega-arms were set up, and the equipment from Noland was being transported here. A full 15,000 humanoid knights will be armed here, then go north along the way and attack the iron from the southern border. The triangular empire, in the territory of the empire, meets with the main army of Richard. The commander of this unit will be Anrekara, in fact Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force that Richard himself will lead has already been assembled. After 10 years of development, the Principality of Chonghong has more than 10 million people. Because most of the population is externally moved, the proportion of young and old is very high. If the Principality is fully mobilized In addition, Richard can quickly set up a large army of up to 500,000, but limited to equipment and logistics supply, eventually Richard only mobilized 80,000 prepared soldiers, with 20,000 original regular troops to guard the entire territory of the Principality, Li Inspecting himself will lead the 100,000-strong army expedition to the Iron Triangle Empire, and the number of logistics troops mobilized for this unit will be more than 500,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unprecedented army has been opened to the Iron Triangle Empire, but even if the striker light cavalry is on the road, it will take three days to reach Salen. Will is scheduled to invade the battlefield, and the thousands of people that Richard can assemble on the border are absolutely resistant to less than three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville abandoned all the tricks, marched at full speed, and Richard spent time, indeed grasping the only weakness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, is this really the weakness of Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before standing in front of the magic map, Richard knew that when he painted the X, the war had already begun, and he was not hurrying to turn back. Said to a group of followers: "This war has already begun. Now, you have two hours to go back and organize the equipment. After two hours, gather in the square and set off on time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, we have already prepared, let's go now, why bother for two hours." From the blue water oasis city to the border, the road is far away, and neither the Sanctuary nor the big magician can Long-haul flights, they need to rush to the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and reached for the X mark and said, "Don't worry, we fly over."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, all followers have gathered in the square. In addition to the followers, Richard also summoned the rider of the Hundreds of Horses and the entire 100 Masters of the 10th level, suddenly in the sky. Passing a huge shadow, the star flies over the square and slowly descends. Some followers have become accustomed to the stars, some climbed to the back of the star, and some let the star tentacles roll on the body, ready to hang below. Although the star is huge, there are also different kinds of followers and partners, such as mountains and seas, and tiramisu. Therefore, in addition to the followers, the star 蛹 蛹 hundreds of mages are already full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
