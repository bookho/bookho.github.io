Richard himself needs to think about it, only to think of what it is. This is what he cut from the monster like the big fish, it is a piece of tissue in its cortex, and later Richard was hunted all the way. Most of the collected materials were forced to throw away their escapes, leaving only a few of the most precious things. This monster skin layer is not too big, but it is too light and tough, and it is mixed in the bottom of the pocket without knowing it. The inspection brought back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is cut from a certain monster, as if it is of little value..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Monsters, tell me carefully, what kind of monsters, all the Dakso Das I have studied, but I have never seen this structure." Lawrence put away the slick and became rare serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then carefully said the encounter with the monster and the battle with him, the more serious Lawrence heard, the more time is not to interrogate a few sentences When Licha finished, he took the sample of the cortical tissue, and on the experimental bench, he cut a few pieces that were as thin as a flap, took out dozens of different drugs and dripped it on it, repeated experiments, and studied carefully. For a long time, this dignifiedly said: "It seems that this special structure has superior resistance to the known magical power, and its bone structure is special, with the leather, naturally forming a Can passively absorb the magical power of the array, if the power of the magic is not enough to bombard it, not only can not hurt it, but it may be to add energy to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Really, this guy's magic resistance is surprisingly high, that is, eight levels of magic are difficult to give it a heavy blow." Richard deeply felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he has no life and no magic, but just an ordinary big magister, most of them have been caught up by this strange fish, magic The resistance is so high that it is so outrageous that any magician will feel an unusual headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe this is a new race in Dakosodas." Richard tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, certainly not, at least not the race that was originally there." Lawrence insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the visceral pieces that were soaked in the bottle on the wall shelf, saying: "Daksodas is dominated by chaos and dark forces. The planes are somewhat similar to the abyss and hell, but not as extreme as there. There is no such thing as a magician. Our so-called magical power is more like an innate instinct for them. Even the so-called black magician, in fact, relies on instinct to cast magic, which is fundamentally different from our Nolan's mage. In Dakso Das, only the legendary strongman has the ability to actively learn and master magic. But their spells are also biased towards the power of darkness. The magic of elements and other systems is limited by the environment, and the power is greatly reduced. No one will learn to use it,” Lawrence explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard nodded, indeed, the plane environment determines the magic choice, such as in the plane of the Green Sen, using fire magic is to go with yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, most of the Dakso Das people are born with good magic resistance, because almost all of the strong races have natural innate abilities like magic. However, most of their magical resistance tends to resist the forces of darkness and chaos. The resistance to the elements is much weaker. For the damage of pure magical energy, such as lightning, the resistance is almost zero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, Lawrence pointed to the meat in front of him and said, "But this one is different. It has the ability to resist all magic. This ability should not be "Ksodas appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill came from the back of Richard, he couldn’t help but say: "Is there a new plane to intervene at dusk? "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three main planes are entangled in the extant battlefield. There is no precedent. The seven-color space is such a place before the complete destruction, Noland. And the two main planes hit the seven-color space, and it took less than a hundred years to completely destroy this plane. , There are so called seven-color space, because of all races, colors bathed in the blood of the earth, the world's seven-color dyed gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a new main plane to set foot in the dusk, then the next complicated situation, no one can predict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily, but the situation is definitely not good. You come with me, I have to find a few old guys to discuss, as if we have a big trouble." Lawrence looked solemn, he Carefully wrapped the organization, inspired a communication reel, and took Richard to the top of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Sundial, located on the lower level of the Eternal Dragon Hall, was originally the temple of the main god, and is now used as an indispensable part of the day to discuss important matters. The main hall of the House of Representatives, the entire day is not lost, only a dozen people are eligible to enter this hall, I did not expect Lawrence to have this qualification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication scroll that Lawrence inspired was obviously not simple. When he and Richard came to the gate of the Sundial Temple, they saw the light and shadow in the air, and they were flying to the temple. Come, and in the temple, there is a deep breath, people want to tremble involuntarily, just like a dragon in the depths of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence looked a happy face and said, "Go in, just in time, Marshal Lundstedt is also there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, at the round conference table in the middle of the main hall, nine people of different shapes were seated, and Richard also had a seat, not only because he was the one who brought this important information, but also Because of the identity of the Holy Orthodox Royal Orthodox Architect, the structs are respected everywhere, especially the promising young builders like Richard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bloodthirsty Philippe suddenly attacked the rising sun, the Noble’s army fortress controlled in the dusk land rose to four. Two of them belonged to the Holy Alliance, so in the dusk, the reputation of the Holy Alliance was completely different, completely overwhelming the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire. As a result, all those who have positions in the Holy Alliance are also rising. The royal faculty of the League, Richard’s status is extremely high, and there is no objection to occupying a seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, almost everyone’s eyes fell on the small piece of meat in the center of the conference table, silent for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magnificent space 30 meters high and nearly 100 meters in radius. There is only one conference table in the whole hall, shooting from the top of the temple. The beam of light just happened to shine on the conference table, and the people sitting around the table were placed in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the conference table, sitting on a tall old man, his body is quite straight, just like a javelin, the whole body will always emit a glimpse The momentum, this old man of military temperament, is the Marshal Long De Stet, who guards the capital of the day, sitting next to the marshal, sitting in a middle-aged man who looks plain, but his face is a bit cloudy, but Sitting next to Long Dested, he seemed to be calm and unaffected, and he was not affected by the Marshal's momentum. Obviously, his strength was not as good as that of the Marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else is watching the meat in a concentrated way. Richard is observing those who support the sun and the capital, and can sit on a military fortress. Long Dested is obviously not an ordinary legendary strongman. The people present here are also different from the ordinary strong. It can be seen that apart from St. Lawrence and Richard, they are not legendary, but also a heavenly sanctuary with powerful power. The ordinary sanctuary has no Qualified to enter here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone observed for a while, St. Lawrence told about his research findings, and then Richard briefly described the battle with the monster and answered the people. Some questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master St. Lawrence, you mean." One person asked, and it can be seen that the people in this hall will respect St. Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence also changed the glitz of the weekdays, and said: "Although it is impossible to rule out the possibility of a third main plane, I think this possibility Sex is not big, a more likely situation is that this monster, we will call it the devil fish for the time being, it should be the Dakso Das people specially trained to deal with us."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a person who is present, almost everyone is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of Nowland in the dusk is not very good, even if Philip regains the rising sun in the incomparably strong, there is no To change the overall situation of Noland's weakness, Dakosodas has superpowers. When they enter the dusk, they will at least contain Philip, if Dakso Das can cultivate this kind of The monsters that are active in the battlefields on the ground, then the situation is really bad. All of them are strong murderers. When you listen to the battles that Richard tells, you know the fighting power of this monster. It is slightly inferior to the holy. The domain can restrain the great magician from dying, and the magical power is the strength of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the monster is bred, it is likely to be accompanied by a chilling word: mass production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary of Mass Production, even if it is lower than the Sanctuary, what is the concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the hall was mired in silence, but the darkness outside the light was exceptionally embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the people present, perhaps the owner of the mother's nest is the most aware of the terror of mass production, and now the mother's nest has the eleventh-order elite warrior. The number of fighters at this level is more than that, and the Nolande Sanctuary has to flee. If they are in a situation where they cannot escape, they will be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
