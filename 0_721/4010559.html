As the messengers of the Eternal and Time Dragons, they are naturally superior to the other gods' gods. The status is not from the mouth, but from the easier access to higher-level grace, and greater power and function. More magical techniques, flowing sand all the way to the dark area, just arrived at the realm of the great priest, but she has a lot of magical changes, the power is so great that it is comparable to a whole sect of the gods, and In the war, the tops of the churches of the three goddesses are more than just a quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon of the annihilation plane is terrible to other priests, but it may be just trouble for the great priests of the eternal dragon temple. They are very eager to try. Although this means that it is very likely to confront the demon in the soul field, even directly with his avatar or apostle, but even if you need to take risks, you can cross the 18th level of this key threshold, which One is a strong will and a strong mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlyn’s eyes are down from beginning to end, and the great priests know that she has a special relationship with Richard. Today’s attitude is really strange, so it’s not Anxious to express his position, the hall suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, Vatican finally said: "Richard, as the servant of the Eternal and Time Dragon, our duty is to help the sacrificer to successfully complete the sacrifice. And we ourselves can't sacrifice, so these sacrifices are useless to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only Richard, but also one The priests are all stunned, Vatican said that it is natural, but for many years, this rule has also had countless ways to go around, such as Vatican can specify the option of God's grace distribution, although there must be Loss, but harvesting six or seven percent of God's grace can still be done, compared with the normal sacrifice harvest, this is ten times the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had originally wanted to say that the sacrifice was in your hands, and he could not specify who sacrificed, but this sentence was hard to swallow, he was not stupid. To the point where it will be said in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin raised his hand and pointed forward, and the power of time fluttering around the sacrifices was divided into a large and quaint book in the air. Then said: "The eternal demon god of the eternal dragon hall has been recorded in this book. Richard, do you know the name of the demon who cursed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called Iskara," Richard said affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin nodded and said, "Nolan, check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nolan came up, took off the book floating in the air, began to look through it, looked at it, her face changed a bit, looked up and said: "There are currently 12 known devils, Iss Kara is not inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some movements of the great priests, an unknown demon means the danger of unknown, and the demon gods who annihilate the plane It is an extra danger. They always thought that they had to deal with one of the twelve demon gods. For these devils, the Eternal Dragon Hall has been recorded. It can be targeted at the time, which is why they know that the opponent is annihilating the plane. Devil, I am willing to give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Isakara is actually outside the Twelve Devils, and the situation is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anyone still willing to give it a try?" Vatican asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the great priests were silent, and Richard’s heart gradually sank. He did not expect that he could not change with ten top sacrifices. With the help of the Eternal Dragon Temple, if even Vatican is not optimistic about the results of this time, then it is mostly useless to find someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his teeth and said, "I can come up with twenty top sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Twenty top prizes mean at least 200 million gold coins, meaning that you can arm an army that can flatten a giant, meaning that you can arm hundreds of knights, meaning a legendary mage Life savings, in a nutshell, mean a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have it?" Vatican whispered a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just got it, you don't care how I got it," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin nodded and said, "Well, I will ask again now, is anyone willing to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The priests are silent again, and Richard has no hope. At this moment, Nolan suddenly stood up and said, "I am willing to try."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican had some accidents and looked at Nolan and said, "You know the risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at Richard and gnawed his teeth: "I know very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin suddenly sighed and said, "You don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am very clear." Nolan insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "Are you really clear, then you said, what is clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The pioneers always have to sacrifice." Nolan said the truth in one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you know, in order to get the information in this book, how many big gods and legendary mages have been sacrificed, on average, to each demon, It’s eleven.” When it came to this, Vatican looked up and looked at Richard and said, “You can’t look at the people around you to die. Similarly, I can’t let these priests participate in mortal tasks. Even if they want to go, I will stop it. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil of the annihilation plane is so difficult to deal with." Richard’s face is already Extremely ugly, he knew that the demon god was very powerful, but he did not expect it to be so powerful, even the Eternal Dragon Temple was helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Familiarity is not so difficult to deal with, but familiarity is a huge price, this price, I do not want to pay, the value of the priests, far from the sacrifice Above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded heavily and said that he understood that he did not want to let him die. Similarly, he could not let the officials go to save the gods. Sending to death, not to mention the fact that even if the officers are willing to go, it will not be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go, there must always be someone who is a pioneer, and I will not necessarily die." Nolan said for the third time, this time she looked very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline finally showed the majesty: "No, if you insist, I will temporarily deprive you of your time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the power of time, Nolan can't do anything. Before Vanine's decision, she has no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard looked at Vatican, he suddenly asked: "Is it true that the priests who went this time are mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Vatican's tone of reply But it looked a bit weird, so Richard had a few words in his heart and asked: "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin reached out and outlined a symbol in the air, massive time The force came together and condensed into a bottle of deep red medicine in the air. The medicine bottle was made of crystal, and it was made into three dragons by black gold. It was coiled on the medicine bottle and formed the base of the bottle. As soon as he appeared, Richard felt that a hot breath was blowing in his face, causing his skin to ache. In the hall, there was a scream of desolateness, but he couldn’t hear the dragon or the demon. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the potion of inflammation, made from the heart of the abyss, and taken it, your Akmon blood will be extremely Excite, so that your soul becomes extremely powerful in a short time, even if you face the annihilation of the demon, you can escape once, but after taking it, the growth of blood power may affect your character and soul, you It’s important to think clearly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like the consequences are acceptable, but such a powerful potion can never be without consequences, and the balance is the entire plane system. At the bottom of the law, the acquisition of any powerful force is always accompanied by a variety of risks, so Richard frowned and asked: "What is the worst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The worst possibility is that the will of the fire will be revived by your soul. From then on you will no longer be you, but the carrier of the will of the fire," Vatican said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How likely is it." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure, between one and a half, before you take it, you'd better visit the goddess of luck."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is not taking it, I have a chance to defeat Iscara."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No chance." Vatican replied I have to cut the iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out of the Eternal Dragon Hall, Richard’s mood was more sullen than when he came, and the potion of inflammation was in his arms, and the magic box It was a drug fee, and ten top sacrifices were exchanged for a bottle of potion. It didn’t seem to be a good deal, but Richard later learned that the main ingredient of this bottle of potion is a complete flaming heart. And the power of the sorcerer is still on the ordinary small lord. This bottle of potion is spent by the Lord God of a high-level plane for hundreds of years to refine, and the result is in a plane war. The master god fell, this bottle of potion became a trophy, was dedicated to the eternal and time dragon, and then somehow, was taken by Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
