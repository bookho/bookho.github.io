			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, suddenly one after another, refined, silent, fierce Kemond walked out from all over the place. They broke through the chaotic crowd and headed for Richard. Then they turned and stood up as a barrier in front of the young wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They clenched their arms and silently looked at the opposite person, and the momentum rose like a mountain! Although the number of these Archimondes is far less than the opposite, no one doubts their courage to pull the knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard began to pulsate strongly, and the blood of Akmon was igniting! As long as the opposing mob dares to take another step, he will not hesitate to inspire the ability of 'hot', and then completely bury the ugly black arc composed of thugs with a burst of flames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under limited terrain constraints, the mobs are crowded together. After ten bombardments of 10 consecutive fireballs, Richard believes that although he will be seriously injured, There should be no more than a single digit in standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And himself, no matter how much injury, will stand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two shrine knights were squirted out, each stepping forward and shouting: "We are the knight of the Eternal Dragon Hall! Who dares to Richard Adults use force, which is regarded as an attack on the Eternal Dragon Temple! Not only does this personality kill, but also the family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration of the two knights surprised everyone As the same as attacking the Eternal Dragon Hall? This consequence is even more serious than attacking the emperor emperor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Suya also changed his face and asked: "Impossible! This is a dispute of the secular aristocracy. How can the eternal dragon hall intervene? Who is this decision?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrine knight turned to Suya and asked, "You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suya straightened her chest and said loudly: "I am Baron Suya Archimonde, my father is the Marquis of Sauron Akmond! I need to know who made this decision?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Knight of the Temple was scornful and sneered and said: "A second-class aristocrat, what is the qualification to question the decision of Ferdinand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Suya face ugly, arguing: "But my father is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple interrupted Suya’s words impatiently Said: "I am talking about the Marquis of Sauron! Do you think it is you? A country baron that I have never heard of is simply not inflow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya His face is red and he wants to drop blood. To utter a word. In the eyes of the true giants of the Holy Alliance, the nobles who are not eligible to enter FS have only been second-rate aristocrats. He is young and young, but he also knows that he is offended by the eternal dragon temple. The priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple do not need to do it themselves. As long as they say something, naturally there are a lot of nobles who are willing to destroy the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long years, I have hardly heard of the eternal dragon temple intervening in secular disputes, even in the dispute between the kingdom and the kingdom, the eternal dragon temple Almost no public participation. what is it today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already in a state of war, but he sees the enemy retreating because of the words of the Knights of the Dragon Knight, although this is in his expectation, but Still feeling full of anger and nowhere to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes fell on Suya. After Su Ya’s self-reported door, Richard was keenly aware that there must be a shadow of this guy behind the current situation on the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The son of Sauron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?!" Baron Suya turned his head. Staring at Richard with extreme anger. After being scorned by the Knights of the Temple, this title is particularly harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You roll, leave this floating island, right away," Richard said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?!" Suya squeezed this out of her teeth, and the handsome face had been distorted by extreme anger. The more dull the attitude of Richard, the more serious his humiliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Suya’s eyes and said in a light voice: “No, you can afford all the responsibilities and consequences, now and in the future. You, sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suya has a fire in his eyes and directs the eyes of Richard. However, in Richard's eyes, Suya only saw the deep sea that was bottomless. And this sea, quiet and waveless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides looked at each other for ten minutes, Suya snorted and gloomyly greeted the guards: "Let's go!" The guards looked blank, but they had to follow Su Behind the Asian Baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard passing by, Suya lowered his voice and said evilly: "The days after that are still very long!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha faintly replied: "For me to ask Uncle Sauron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya body slightly shocked, deep After a deep look at Richard, he stopped talking and strode into the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the transfer array, a young and fierce guard behind Suya couldn’t help but say, "Adult, why don’t you just kill Richard? The Eternal Dragon Hall has rules that cannot interfere with the affairs of the aristocracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya finally couldn’t help but anger, slammed, and gave it back. The guards have a loud slap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young guards were beaten in a whirlwind, full of blood, a look of grievances and incomprehensible look at the back of Suya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another older guard sighed and lowered his voice and said to him, "Hey, you stupid! Richard and other sons of Gordon Can it be the same? Those little guys will kill if they kill, but they really want to move Richard, and they can’t be in this kind of occasion. Even if the eternal dragon temple doesn’t intervene, you don’t want to think about the teacher of Richard? If we are reasonable That's it, now it's such a thing... Once I have hurt Richard in the eyes of the public, how can the Highness be able to give up? The Highness, who killed millions of gray dwarfs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young escorts finally stunned: "So that means we have to find a time to take the plunge, or, there can be no witnesses, so that the prince can't find an excuse Dealing with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course! Once the Highness is really hands-on, it is not just to deal with us, even the Marquis of Sauron is hard to escape!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young guards nodded and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little episode outside the floating island was not placed on Richard’s heart. He said to the members of the branch family who are at a loss in front of him: "As for you, if you want to stay, you can leave when you want to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
