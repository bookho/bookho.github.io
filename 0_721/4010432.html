			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the screams of the Daksodars have been faint To the end of the day, at the top of the fortress, a huge burning fireball is rising, hovering in the air, and spreading the sacred light and heat to the whole day. The capital is like a new sun rising in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent glory, its grandeur is like a mountain, you sometimes even forget its existence, but it is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new sun hangs high above the sun, the fortress becomes a dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep darkness, countless Dakosodas' strong men are roaring angrily, almost crazy, as an absolutely antagonistic camp, as The old rivals who have fought each other for nearly a thousand years, the Dakso Das people are not the first to see the glory of the time, but also have experienced the ubiquitous power, but let them be crazy is the source of power for the long-lasting glory . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the interpretation of Noland, the long-lasting radiance of the phalanx is a sacrifice, but from the perspective of Dakso Das, the so-called sacrifice They are all corpses that their compatriots have been cut. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the several regiment fortresses occupied by the Daksodars, there are also several large-scale dark circles that drive the Faction The source of strength is the ** and soul that the Nolans strong have been captured over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war never ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the planes, between the continents, between races, between countries, between the lords, between the neighborhoods, between the brothers and sisters and relatives, you can see To war and battle, this is the eternal theme of the life of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the war is full of Richard’s life, no matter the day or night, there will always be killing, screaming or snoring into Richard’s room. Drilled into his ears, for these sounds, Richard always turned a deaf ear, and did not give attention to fine-grained, because the ability to hear the sound means safe, and the lack of sound is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no, the word danger doesn't seem to be very accurate, but Richard doesn't have time but finds a more accurate definition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment is dusk, Richard is standing in front of the workbench, concentrating on the magic pen, under the thin needle tip, a perfect line is in the matrix Extending upwards, the extracts of several magic materials are driven from the tip of the pen with different mixing ratios driven by Richard Magic, giving the drawn lines various types of power attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most troublesome part of the countless builders, mixing different magic materials in one line, and the proportion has to be corresponding with the extension of the lines. Variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This line has finally come to an end, but Richard suddenly disappeared from the workbench. The next moment he appeared in front of the window, the savage slaughter in his hand was difficult for the naked eye. The high frequency that I saw was shaking and slowly forwarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, there was just a demon who poked his head out and looked carefully into the room, and then all his vision was getting more and more The close blade is completely occupied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brutal slaughter pierced the head of the devil without any hindrance, and then slammed, the part of the devil's entire shoulder was broken, blood And the meat was sprayed with a look at Richard, and it was splashed everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha clenched his teeth, his cheeks were trembling, and apparently had reached the limit, he screamed angrily, looking back, sure enough A large group of blood stains just fell on the unfinished structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the devil has strong magical properties and corrosiveness. Richard does not need to check at all, and knows that this structure is destroyed again. This is already ruined. The fourth life is extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the first time in his life, Richard’s production was a loss, and he lost a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife that just pierced the head of the devil is actually a superposition of eighteen knives, and the cumulative life is too powerful, so that the demons are instantly destroyed. The body, in fact, this knife is surprising, right in the middle, as long as a stack of three or five knives is enough, but Richard is drawing life, the chest is killing when it is boiling, for a while did not control the weight of the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time. Richard’s slashing is always flesh and blood, and then his structure is often smashed. For now, this is also Definitely not the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard snorted, changed a new matrix, and picked up the magic pen. Since he chose the city defense zone as a residence, he would not change his original intention for this little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the anger and killing accumulated in Richard's chest is almost overflowing, and the magic strokes are a stroke, and a killing line is on the paper. When the first line came out, he had already foreseen that this life would be different, so he couldn’t care for the other and bury himself in the world of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pen is generally swept over the substrate, and the magic material piled up around it is gradually consumed, and the killing in the room is getting stronger and stronger. The murderousness of the bottom of the heart is gradually accumulating, and there is a deep sea before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mouse is coming, it is inexplicably divided into two halves, falling in the yard, there is another devil fish, it smells a strong magical atmosphere This is like a cheese attracting a mouse, but it has just swam into the courtyard from the big gap in the courtyard wall. The back of the wall suddenly spurts out the blood spring, the tentacles have already shattered, and there is more blood on the back. Pit, pointing to the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, day and night passed, and Richard’s life will be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a sudden shout from afar, it was a human voice, apparently experiencing unspeakable pain and fear. Will make such a distorted cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the human beings fighting in the sun-drenched capital are all sanctuary strong, that is, there are a few who have not reached the sanctuary or the level of the magister, and also Li Investigating the need to restrain one's own strength, or some talents, if you want to take advantage of the strong points of the sacrifices, what can scare the strong and strong will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart moved, put down the magic pen, went upstairs, pushed open the window and looked out, from his point of view, just outside the wall . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a short distance from the city wall, a human strong man is being stripped of his clothes, his hands and feet are nailed and can’t move, but both ends The mouse demon is applying a dark brown sticky substance to him, which is the seasoning of the Dakosodas, and next to it, there are more than a dozen Dakosodas who have different personal heights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They actually want to add a meal, the object of the meal is the captured human powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the distance is not so close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at it, Richard determined that this must be a trap, and it was a very poor trap, but the long horn of the human strong is When the voice is clear, even if the person who is determined to be determined is facing a desperate situation that is about to be eaten by the students, it may collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his workbench and just thought about it. He leaned over and grabbed the weapon scorpion that had been leaning against the table, in three long The knife smashed, then took out the savage slashing knife and the elf knife, pushed open the door and walked to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the street, Richard unexpectedly saw the white night. The two men looked at each other and said nothing, they naturally walked to the gate, white night In the front, the two-handed knife was slightly behind, protecting her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are out of town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard and White Night returned to the sun-drenched capital. They don’t know how many wounds they have, blood is everywhere, already Can't tell whether it is the enemy or his own blood, but the sanctuary has returned, but it is divided into two, the upper body is in the hands of the white night, the lower body is Richard, and he already has some cockroaches on his body. Traces of food, but after all, they are still back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a small-scale battle that has lasted for one day and two nights at the gate of the city just came to an end, and a small group of human powers regained the gate and put Dak The Soudas were temporarily driven out of the city. They stared at Richard and the White Nights, and stared at the body of the Sanctuary who was almost buried in the belly of the Dakosodas. I dare not believe these two. The individual actually rushed into such a obvious trap, and then not only came back alive, but also robbed the strong, although it was only a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one cheered at the moment, and no one applauded. They thought about the same thing in their minds. White nights were a madman, and now there is another Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two slams, the body of the Sanctuary was thrown into the crowd, and Richard said faintly: "Buy him, It’s quite loud.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of strong people was quite ashamed at the moment, this person was originally one of them, although the impasse was terrible, However, such a screaming voice is somewhat unspeakable, and it is extremely damaging to the morale of the human side. However, he is already dead. The pre-death glory will not be mentioned anymore. His name will remain in the root of the temple. On the pillar of the Spirit, and all the people who responded to the call to defend the dusk, and who died for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
