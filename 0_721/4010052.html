			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first turned around the bottom of the castle and looked at each room Look, then stop in the empty warehouse area, and the line of sight slowly sweeps through every corner of the reservoir area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went to the second floor. The Archimonde, who has been silently behind him, guarding Richard, did not go upstairs, but dispersed himself to the bottom of the castle to serve as a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon left a small number of guards who are now concentrated on the second floor. These still loyal guards guard the most important areas of the castle and are ready to give up life. On the second floor, Richard went into the room of the old butler and saw the old butler who was still in bed and unable to move freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! Richard's clenched hand uploaded the crisp sound of the knuckles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, the old butler forced the body, the whole person was shaking slightly, and he was pleasantly surprised: "Master Li, you are back!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the bed of the old butler and said softly, "I am back, safe and sound, and I am still standing on the other side." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper nodded and said: "The owner has been thinking about you before leaving. But I didn't expect... but you don't have to worry, the master is only in the middle. A small trap will definitely come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently patted the old man’s hand and said, "I know he can’t die. You have a good rest. Since I am back, I will hand it over to me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler suddenly remembered something, took a necklace from the neck, and attached a necklace to the end. Golden key. He handed the key to Richard and said, "At the top of the castle, the owner left you something, and there was a gift from the barbarian mountain and sea hall, which was also placed in the owner's private area. This is Enter the key to that area, but before you use it, you must let it soak your blood. Otherwise, it will trigger an extremely powerful lightning trap, which is also impossible for the sanctuary. I am afraid that those people will rush into the owner. In the restricted area, after putting the things sent from the mountain and the sea to the restricted area, the area was closed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the keys Leave the room of the old butler and continue to patrol the upper level of the castle. After gently closing the door of the old butler, he took a deep breath and slowly spit it out, so there was a sulphur scent in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third floor, Richard saw his brothers and sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington and Winika are good fire guards, and Yan Mei is already an 11th-level curse, only weaker than Richard A line. However, the beauty that Li Cha saw was still weak, and she even raised the neckline intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her frown and reached down to pull down the neckline of her hair, almost revealing her entire chest/skull. Under her collarbone, I can see a shocking bruise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes of Richard’s contraction faintly asked: “Are they invading you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! It's not what you think. Just..." Some of the gaze sighed, and finally sighed, and said helplessly: "Well, I was too careless, sneaked, and sneaked a heavy weight. As for the scar on the shoulder, it just fell and bruised. It was a shame, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where was it beaten?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li reached out and gently pressed there, but although the singer did not say anything, the eyebrows were obviously wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say anything, left the room of Yan Mei and continued to move up. The fourth floor is the exclusive office area of ​​Gotton. The usual core staff and subordinates are accessed by another staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi has been following Richard, and when he arrives here, he will not move forward, shrugging and saying: "The above is not where I should enter, so I Waiting for you here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said to her, "It’s good. I will come down to you later. I think, about the count. Adults, we should have a lot of topics to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth floor is the office area, and Gordon’s study, office and war room are placed on this floor. As before, after every room has been seen, Richard continues to move up. But at the end of the stairs is a locked door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the key and stroked it on his wrist, and the blood suddenly rushed out and was dyed on the key. This key actually inhales the blood of Richard and begins to emit the blood of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee inserts the key into the keyhole on the door, gently twists it, the card clicks, the lock opens, and the door slides silently inward open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting started, Richard saw the ancient animal bones from the mountains and the sea in the awe-inspiring space, and saw the heavy wrapping. Star beast head. Just looking at it, Richard knew that these two are good sacrifices. The ancient beast was bare and exposed, exuding the scent of the years, and the starburst head in the package gave him a strong sense of danger. If this thing is sent to the Eternal Dragon Hall, it will most likely be a highest level of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard has made a decision to sacrifice these two things before returning to the Faro plane. They are the most valuable things in the entire castle, and now, what Richard feels he needs to do is transform everything into something that can bring immediate power. The sacrifices will only reflect the true value when they are sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the huge parcel of gray and recognized the texture of the magic fabric. Richard did not trade and rushed to unravel the rather familiar package, but looked up and down, and surely saw the familiar handwriting left by the magic pen on the side. That is the handwriting left by Su Hailun, just the word ‘caution’. It was just a word, but it made Richard look at it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard came to the cemetery of the Archimonde family. It is still a dark, bloody sky, filled with sulphur, and the crater will always emit smoke from the fire. The dark tombstones stand quietly, silently telling the history of blood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows that this is an independent space, only approved Akmen can enter. Otherwise, you must use pure power to suppress the brand of the owner. At this time, only Richard himself can enter the family cemetery. He looked up and looked up at the volcano, and his sight fell on the top of the cemetery. He still remembers where the mother was scheduled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gordon... This man, if not dead in the opposite, will one day be buried in this layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood quietly, trying to expel Gotton from his heart, and was not prepared to consider everything about him. In the mind of Richard, the Akmon family cemetery originally had nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes swept through every corner of the cemetery, determined to keep this from being disturbed by any mobs and enemies. This has nothing to do with guarding Archimonde, just because it is the place where the mother is scheduled, so it is necessary to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee persuaded himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the family cemetery, Richard has visited every part of the castle. He finally returned to Gordon's war room, standing in front of the big map of Noland, standing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This station is an hour, and no one knows what Richard is thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the night fell, Richard finally moved. He rang the bell that summoned the attendant, and after a moment the two attendants came in. Richard once saw them around Gotton, knowing that these two people are old people who have followed Gotton for many years, and there is no doubt about loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Li, what do you have to order?" asked an elderly attendant. These attendants have a wealth of knowledge and good personal strength, which is actually equivalent to the assistant role of Gordon in handling daily trivia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricardo was indulged and said, "In our exclusive plane, there are now five knights in the station?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master Richard. They are the blood paladin Samma, the boxing fighter Wald..." The attendant said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and interrupted the attendant and said, "Don't tell me who they are, because no one is different. I want to inform them. Let them rush back to the floating island at the fastest speed. I know that each plane has a portal to this place, so there is nothing unexpected, I should be able to see them at this time tomorrow, all!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant should have responded first, then said: "However, Master Li, they still need to guard their respective planes, it may be inconvenient to come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha interrupted the attendant again: "The situation on the floating island is already like this. Why can't they come over? Not to mention coming back. You tell them, the Marquis of Gordon When I didn't come back, everything in the family is now hosted by me. They must come to see me! If this one has not arrived yet at this time tomorrow, then he will not have to come back. Later, I will personally go to the exclusive meeting. Theirs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...not so good? Maybe after some time, like A year or two, may be more appropriate. "Some attendants said with worry. His euphemistic location out of Richard's current strength may not be strong enough. If you want to replace the Gordon guardian of Archimonde, it will be worse. At least it is difficult to shock the generals who don't want to bow to the second person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha heard his words, smiled and said: "It doesn't matter, let's pass the news! Now, at least, if I play the little one, I still don't. Who will be afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant has fulfilled his obligation to persuade, and then passed the message through the plane magic array to the four exclusive planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all planes, the five knights react differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
