			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten boxes of enchantment equipment are all fine, the total market price is roughly 100 Around 10,000 gold coins, but without ordering in advance, it is difficult to find such large-volume, uniform-sized products in such a short period of time. Only the royal family and several big giants can easily take out so many fine equipment from the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This batch of supplies is part of the reward that Richard has exchanged for the six pieces to the royal family. The magical civilization of the Faro plane is at least a few hundred years apart from Noland. The enchanted armies can sell three times the price in the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard’s trip to this plane was a profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal guards left after the inventory was cleared. Richard then adjusted the guards of the two shrines in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Royal Guards left, Richard personally covered the magic box one by one and closed it with magic. Then sit on one of the boxes and let out a sigh of relief. There is a million gold coins sitting under the ass, this feeling is really strange. Just a few years ago, Gordon’s total income from the plane was less than a million coins. But now, Gordon’s one-year gain is sitting under his ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an old saying goes, the constructionist’s fingers are all flowing with gold sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air in the warehouse was slightly cool and slightly damp. In that riot, the constant temperature magic array of the warehouse was destroyed, although it was still usable overall. But occasionally it will stop working. So it becomes a bit like the traditional sigh of breath, and you will feel the heavy and quiet taste when you breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hurry to leave, but sat quietly, recalling some past events. From the bottom of the box below the ass, Richard is already stronger than the same age of Gordon. I don't know what Gotton would think when he saw this and what he would say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, maybe, that man can't see it all again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that he needed a drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he strode out of the storeroom, the sky was slightly dim, and there was still some time left for dinner. When Richard didn't go to the restaurant, he went back to the study and told the butler to send a bottle of brandy and a few pieces of bread. Then he sat at the table and spread out the letter paper, ready to write a letter to Su Hailun and Shan Hai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quill pen was in his hand but could not fall. Faced with blank stationery, Richard, who had painted countless magical arrays, didn't know how to write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back, I will go back soon. That plane is called Faro. It is very safe." This is a letter to Su Helun. After thinking for a long time, Richard did not know how to call her, so she had to leave a blank in the position of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easier to make mountains and seas: “I am coming back. I will go to you before the appointed time.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two letters were written, and Li had a sweat. These two letters are written in a number of times more difficult than drawing a structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully took the two envelopes, called the old butler and handed it to him. The two thin sheets of paper were handed out, and Richard felt that the two stones in his heart had been put down a little and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the old butler left, Richard sat on the edge of the desk, poured a glass of wine for himself, and thought about the matter, while sipping the wine in the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine glass quickly bottomed out, so Richard poured another cup for himself. The spirits are like fire, going down the throat and burning in the stomach. When it was uncomfortable to burn, Richard unconsciously grabbed a piece of bread and swallowed a few mouthfuls, so he felt much better. I poured another glass of wine for myself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the burning wine, Richard’s consciousness gradually drifted away, thinking of a lot. Thinking of the deep blue sigh, I also thought of the agreement to visit the mountains and the sea on the mainland of Calando. Richard is not stupid, and now naturally knows that the identity of the mountains and the sea is extraordinary, and that Calando and Noland have never had a relationship. The trip will not be calm, and it is estimated that there will be a lot of barbarian warriors on the road. And if there is an opportunity, presumably they will never mind killing themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard was thinking, the door knocked and the old housekeeper came in. When he saw Richard, he suddenly saw a moment, and there was an instant loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sharply captured the look of the old butler, and similar expressions appeared on the face of Dragon Master Lina. Then he asked: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper said about him, "The Eternal Dragon Hall sent a message to inform you that you will go to the Dragon Hall tomorrow morning. Sacrifice ceremony. The ceremony will begin at 10 o'clock on time. Another news is that Vatican's great priest wants you to go to the Dragon Hall earlier, and she wants to talk to you privately."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I know. Then, when you saw me, why did you seem to be surprised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler couldn’t get through, just said: “The younger look is very similar to the master.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of it as such an answer. For a moment, he suddenly had a lot of haze in his heart, waving his hand in silence and letting the old housekeeper leave. Sitting on the edge of the desk at the desk, I picked up the glass. Until then, Richard remembered, sitting on the edge of the table, this is a habitual action of Gordon. But the similarities that the old butler said are certainly not the similarity of one or two movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very similar to that man? Really go to him / mom /! Richard groaned in his heart, then his hand jerked and the whole glass of wine went down. A fire like a spring is burning from the throat to the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bastard man, who would have been so naive about the enemy, now does not know which part of the time in the turbulent flow. How can you be like him! Richard thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning wine rushed, like a fire, swallowing Richard’s sobriety. Richard’s body was soft and he fell slowly. Before losing consciousness, he stumbled that the occasional indulgence was actually very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand how I got back to the room and how to lie on the bed. When a ring of bells woke him from sleep, it was already the next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that his headache had to crack, and he had never drunk so much. However, although it is very difficult to get drunk, but in the process of drunk, the feeling of the mood is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a hot towel was handed over, and Richard picked it up and rubbed it on his face for several times, feeling more comfortable. A pair of soft arms behind him sat on him and sat up. Li set his mind and turned his head to see that the person who helped him was actually cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
