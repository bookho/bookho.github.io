			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you understand the principle of capturing stars, the latter things are simple, Li Only need to constantly calculate new orbits, you can accommodate more stars. In theory, when five stars appear, the magic recovery is equivalent to the existing star wells, that is, five stars. In addition, the well of the stars can double the recovery speed of Richard's magic. According to this calculation, when Richard has 80 stars, the speed of magic recovery is equivalent to the consumption of a normal big magister when casting spells. That is to say, if Richard is fighting in the normal rhythm of an ordinary big magister, the magic is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Richard suddenly got excited, but then he realized that he wanted to capture 80 stars. The calculation of the orbit is probably as difficult as the rest. The rule of the nest of the blue plane is completely resolved. It is really necessary to have that level. Richard estimates that he has already gone deep into the legend, and he still has to use the method of the big magic to kill and burn hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the orbital increase is so difficult, then Richard should carefully select the captured stars, but not at random, so as not to waste a valuable track, the best The choice is naturally the origin of all kinds of planes. This kind of energy itself contains rules and has a considerable help to the analytical rules. It is only a very rare source of strength. For a long time, Richard has only got two. The plane is the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the stars found in the meteorite plane are not suitable. In contrast, the energy of the valley is more biased towards pure magic. Richard's help is even greater, and the earth element of the meteorite plane has a limited effect on Richard. In addition to the source of the plane, Richard also needs pure star power, because only Starpower can strengthen both Archimonde and Silver. The blood of the moon elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, the army of the reorganization of the meteorite plane continued, and there were about a hundred or so Archimonde Knights entering the meteorite plane. They served as the middle-ranking officers of the garrison. This constituted the backbone of an army. After repeated thoughts, Richard left Raya as the temporary chief of the guardian plane, waiting for the elf poet Oral to transfer. Later, Raya was able to serve as the deputy of Oral. After a few days of seeing the environment around the base and the location of the iron ore vein, Richard returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, when I returned to Faust, Richard always felt that the atmosphere was a bit strange, but I couldn’t tell what was wrong, interrogated, floating island and floating world. The situation in Denet is normal. There was no major event during the time that Richard left. The news from Nolan is the same. If the news of the secular and the eternal dragon hall is no big deal, then there should be nothing. Richard is so comforting to himself, but his heart is always like a shadow, gray and very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard prepared the griffin on the floating island, Nyris did not know where to get the news. He rushed in. He wore a gorgeous soft armor, but wrapped it in a heavy cloak, even under the cap. With a sterling silver mask to cover the eyes and ears, the dress of the four emperors shocked Richard, and did not understand what new tricks the guy had come up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee, are you going to find the trouble of the Silver Sword family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard nodded and said: "Yes, time is almost up, I am going to join the army. This war must win, so I have to go to the command in person. The silver sword family itself is not enough, but I am hiding. Those guys behind the scenes may have a secret start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris took off the mask and revealed the face of the fairy, asking: "If the guys behind the scenes are not cited by you What to do when you come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then clean up the silver sword, and then cancel Cannan again." Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris frowning asks: "But what reason are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li smiled and said: "There is a clear statement in history. If you want to play, you can do it. The reason is that you don't need it. If you need it, you can find it after you finish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris shrugged and said, "It’s very brilliant, but you have to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought a lot of people I still have some good things. If I still can't win, I won't have to mix it." Li said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerris patted Richard’s shoulder and said, “I will go with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him questioningly and said, "You are so busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a bad mood, by the way, learn how you command." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking, Nyris’s hand has not been put down, it was a normal pat on the shoulder, now it becomes a shoulder, quite awkward Richard snatched Neris's hand in a quiet manner and said, "That's just you, but you can't learn the way you command the battle. You don't have a big strategy, you are no worse than me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neris shook his head. "Don't say so much, are you going to leave, then let's go now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee fixed the bag On the griffin, look back at Nyris, who only mentioned a small bag, and said, "You brought something like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, a little Clothes, everything else is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, today Richard always feels that this topic is a bit strange, so I don’t say more, I turned over. Griffin, fortunately, now Archimonde is also rich and rich, the top grade of the gryphon has a lot of stocks, and it is not too hard to install a Nyris. After a while, the six griffins will take off and fly to the west. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Richard tried to ask: "Why are you in a bad mood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese was silent and did not answer, just boring her head forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Richard and Nyris, who had only had a short break in the middle, caught up with the troops that had previously departed, 50 knights, two hundred The front knight, the one-hundred-throw spear thrower and the 800-hundred Archimonde Knights, this is the pilot force. This pilot force marches at full speed, leaving the follow-up army far behind, leading the leading force. Twilight and Tiramisu, there is also a thinker. This kind of equipment is that Richard can’t come, and it is enough to defeat the Earl of Silver Sword. Now, not only is Richard, but also a Neris. If there is no prejudice against the appearance of Nyris, the Four Emperors are indeed a strong aid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After converging the troops, and then marching for half a day, they arrived at the Earl of Silver Sword. The silver sword family has a long history. There are a large number of aristocrats in the family. Most of the territory is on the western border. They are each other, and they are dotted with each other. They form a system of complete mutual assistance. Most of the new territory of the silver sword is expanded outside the border of the alliance. At the same time, they also block the momentum of expansion of other families in this area. The section boundary line becomes the posture of the inner boundary of the silver sword family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver sword family that got the news has already assembled 7,000 people to "greet" Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Richard’s pilot force to come too fast, the Silver Sword family would be able to assemble tens of thousands of troops, and the Scouts would have sent the news back to the silver sword collar. So when Richard’s squad ran to the border of the silver sword territory, he saw a neat army array that firmly blocked the road through the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard glanced at the rigorous military line opposite and nodded. He said, "It's not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris also said: "Be able to be at the border The old family rooted in the roots is somewhat embossed. How about it, it feels like hitting the iron plate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron plate." Richard just laughs Laugh, then move forward and say, "I don't see where their knights are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris sighed and said: "Now who will be stupid to take the precious knights to your squadrons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "What is necessary is this. The effect." After that, he marched forward and went to the silver sword family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several nobles in the silver sword army arrayed and rushed out to meet Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at a few people and asked, "Finril, why didn't I see him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged aristocrat is slightly in the body and said: "The father has something else, and he is not on the territory at the moment. Now the territorial affairs are temporarily under the responsibility of me, the ferry man."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feng Manjue, the first heir to the silver sword family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is by far the only heir. "Fei male added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a cry, "It seems to be the same for you, take your army away, they block my way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Man’s face was a stagnation, his anger passed away, and then he returned to normal, saying: “This is the territory of the Silver Sword family, my soldiers stand. Where is our freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we passed the way." Richard looked like a harmless smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the face of the silver sword has changed, the detour is passing, the silver sword collar is flat, and the configuration of the Richard Cavalry can be said to come and go freely, bypassing the avenue It also circumvented the assembled army. Wherever Richard wants to go, he can't go there. In case Richard wants to go to the Jianfeng City, the main city of Silver Sword, he is not copying their old nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
