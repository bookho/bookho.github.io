This means that the total area of ​​dark blue is more than ten times that of the ordinary magic tower, which does not include the huge subsidiary buildings. The magic tower of this scale is so costly that it is hard to imagine. There are more than 10,000 people living directly and indirectly around the dark blue. Simple is the size of a small city. But dark blue is like a huge monster, and the amount of material that is swallowed every day is ten times that of a city of the same size. To this scale, the dark blue building itself is already a superb art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the circulation of goods, the deep blue waters of the mountains and seas bring a deep-water port, and more than a dozen berths capable of mooring giant ocean-going seaboats are magically used in hard reefs. The rock was born and opened up. On land, the three main roads are connected to the deep blue from three directions, and at least five or six towns along the road are prosperous because of trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue is located at the apex of the ice floes in the northwestern part of the mainland, and is also the estuary of two large rivers. The area of ​​the ice floes is vast, completely sea. From the southern end of the Xinghui Peninsula to the northern line of the Hengdong Mountains, the straight line is more than 1,500 kilometers. Every winter, the ice floes will enter the freezing period, and only the southernmost coastline will be open to navigation. The deep blue port is located at the end of the ** and belongs to the non-freezing port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the deep blue is very important, the transportation here is convenient, and it also guards one of the three main passages under the ice ocean mainland, fierce polar gray dwarf and Warcraft You can only choose to circumnavigate the sunset canyon in the east. The road should be more than a thousand kilometers away, and you need to face the Thor fortress in the Holy Alliance. However, several battles after the completion of the deep blue made the polar gray dwarfs prefer to attack the Thor's fortress, and they are not willing to try Su Hailun's means. This woman has been juxtaposed with the most horrible evil gods in the legends of many tribes of the polar gray dwarf. When she officially broke through the 20th level and advanced to the legendary mage, Deep Blue became a peaceful land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the gray dwarf, who is known for being fierce and brutal and powerful, is not willing to destroy the peace here. Then gradually, the dark blue became a beautiful and prosperous land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the history of dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrator of this history is a nearly 100-year-old master, his magic is not high, the level of eight is almost Richard in the dark blue The most meaty color I have seen. However, the old mage sold very well, and the voice was swaying. The history of the deep blue is second only to Su Helun. His job is simple, to explain history to the visitors who came to Deep Blue. For a new apprentice like Richard, learning the deep blue glow and glory of the past is the first lesson of his magical career, and its importance even exceeds the magic and talent detection. The latter determines which magician can go further in a complex magical world. The former, Richard did not understand until a long time, but decided whether a magic apprentice can take the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of Richard is different from other magic apprentices. He is a disciple who Su Hailun personally recruits. Therefore, the history of ordinary apprentices has changed into three days. If you want to talk about the history of dark blue for three days, it is indeed a test of the level of the old Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the old Master naturally misses many details and deliberately ignores many key things. However, the history of official writing always has some choices. What can be said, what can only be forgotten, is learning. Being able to piece together a fairly complete picture in my mind, Richard has already thoroughly played out the wisdom and real talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days of brainwashing still has a significant effect. At least when Richard sees Su Hailun again, she will never be regarded as an innocent and white girl, and she has no impulse to bite. A woman who is afraid of even the gray dwarfs and the ice giant behemoths can't be overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this result is definitely not the original intention of the old Master, but he will not know. In the eyes of most people, Richard is a quiet child, quiet to very few extra expressions, never seen him laughing happily, never seeing him being reprimanded or being bullied and crying, let him do anything immediately To do it, and to be meticulous, accurate and impeccable, not like a child who is only ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard, there is no sunshine at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-day history lesson is the next magic talent test. Richard was brought into a special hall, and the alchemy equipment was dazzled by him. There are more than 20 busy masters in the hall. The master of the test is a great magician. When Richard uses the 'real' ability, he sees not a magician at all, but a burning mass. Magic Fireball! This is a great magician of at least seventeenth level. He can be a court mages in any empire, but he is assigned to be his talent test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken off his body clothes, pressed on a cold metal chair, and wrapped around his body with various straps, then the great magician personally put A few crystal needles carefully pierced Richard's body. The whole process was very painful, but Richard silently bit his teeth and endured. Looking at the battle, I know that the detection is not the same, he has never heard of the talent detection will be so big. The detection of the ordinary apprentice, that is, throwing a level 0 magic on the crystal ball. However, these masters treated the ordinary inspection rituals as the most important magical experiments. They were serious and conscientious, and the movements were neat and tidy. All the high-level masters showed their full literacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard didn’t know was that after the magic wall with a single-sided transparency, Su Hailun was leaning comfortably on the sofa, paying attention to everything in the inspection ceremony. . Although she held the notes of the legendary Master of this predecessor, she kept grabbing the fruit snacks and filling them into the mouth. However, the method of the legendary Master is not something that ordinary people can speculate. Even without the eyes and ears, she has hundreds of kinds. The method can monitor everything that happens around you. Under the eyes of Su Hailun, all the Masters did their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Blue has only one master, that is Su Hailun, who is a servant except her. As long as she can make her happy, the treatment of the Masters is likely to increase by 50% immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage came over and put a beaker under Richard's nose, letting him inhale all the mist that floated inside. After a while, Richard’s consciousness gradually became blurred, but he remained awake and vaguely aware of what was happening around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of strange feelings coming from all over the body. After a while, I heard a vague voice saying: "The elemental affinity is high, the flame and the shadow and the sacred aspect are slightly stronger. The talent element, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is all kinds of severe pain. This is the test of Richard's bearing capacity for elemental destruction and the most basic component of magic resistance. After a while, the sound again declared the result of good resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in the consciousness of Richard suddenly seemed to be stabbed into a needle, the pain actually directly affects the soul! Although in the coma, Richard couldn't help but twitch, but his body was firmly bound and unable to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent mentality, close to genius." After hearing this evaluation, Richard finally relaxed, and it was still in the test. And the evaluation that I got seemed to be very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it’s all about the meticulous testing of bodily functions. What Richard doesn’t know is that even the mages of these professions have even tested his male talents. Once again, I got a quick and useful evaluation, which is even higher than his magical talent. The inspection took place for three hours and eventually resulted in a report of more than 20 pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
