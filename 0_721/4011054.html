			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look back, but he also knew the different things of the goshawk, but said faintly: "Nothing, but my responsibility is heavier." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk does not know that every time Richard uses the redemptive ability, he will feel that he has a lot of heavy things, this time redeemed 10,000 Two thousand rushing iron rides, outside the increase of the Elf Wang Lie blade. The soul of the wind, so that Richard always felt a lot heavy, so that there is a footprint on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raytheon brought out by Richard this time has been re-improved according to the reaper technology. The driving force is generated by the power metal, the power is greatly improved, and the range is reached. Amazing 500 meters, this is the killing machine that Noland has never seen before, and it has more or less the style of the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of the Elven Empire, the invincible rushing iron ride, just under the barrage of the massive Raytheon, went to the end of history, the glory of the millennium, at this moment The end of the drama, the end of the whole drama, is so tragic, but it is the inevitable result of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high elves of the Cangqing Continent have been intoxicated for thousands of years in a closed state, like a big dream, but the dream was finally awakened before Richard’s tyrannical iron hoof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Raytheon is not without its shortcomings. Its shortcoming is also that the recoil is too big and the ammunition is too expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thunders use metal shots mixed with a small amount of power metal, so the power is extremely huge. If you change the ordinary projectiles, the power will drop by half immediately, and the range is also It is reduced to one hundred and fifty meters, and the power metal can only be taken from the reaper. It is a little less with a little bit. Therefore, the projectiles are extremely expensive. If it is not for dealing with the famous frosty iron ride, Richard will not use it. Raytheon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Richard expected, even after such a terrible defeat, Elf Wang Ting still refused to talk to Richard about the exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the pragmatic people of Richard and Goshawk, the value of the golden world tree branches is clearly above the footprints of the saints, and now the elf empire is strong, The essence is much weaker than it seems, and there is the ability to travel to the abyss. The footprints of the saints are in the hands of the high elves, and now the power of the elves, not to mention the abyss of Abis, I am afraid that even half of the footprints of the saints Can't finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the Cangqing mainland have been self-enclosed for nearly a thousand years. Their comfortable life has been going on for too long. Although it is said that there are four superpowers, Richard has already handed over to the three superpowers, and they already know them. Strength is at the superpower level, but real combat power is two different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Druid and the Holy Elves in the actual battle of the courage and bravery are far less than the human power, especially the elf emperor, in terms of individual strength The 29th-level sacred king is even higher than the undecided, but Richard can assert that if the two sides really want to die, they can definitely kill the sacred king within an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Saint Druid and the Emperor of the Elf, it was not even half the time. The elf emperor did not know how many years had not been decent. The battle is over. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Noland, human beings not only have to fight against the aliens in the void and the battlefields, but also within the three empires. In the case, let alone the super strong, that is, any legend is also smashed from the hurricane. The whole history of mankind is a part of the history of war, and the strong who survived the war is also truly strong. By. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t say that Noland’s superpower, even if Caledon’s Asa came to the green continent, was invincible, except for the suspected one. Beyond the god of law, she defeated the other three superpowers without any suspense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf empire on the green continent is too weak to imagine, and it is not a problem for Richard to sneak out at the moment. However, Richard is now no interested in pioneering the territory. He only wants the footprints of the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Elf Wang Ting did not want to talk, then Richard only continued to march forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Richard defeated the last elite of Elf Wang Ting, and a full 50,000 high elf warrior died in half a battle, 20,000 were captured, only a few thousand elves escaped Into the surrounding forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this campaign, Richard finally no longer retains his strength. One person is the only one of the three great elves. The Holy Elves are seriously injured and still play. The Holy Elves were severely wounded and injured to death. St. Druid was seriously injured and fled. Only the Emperor of the Elf was slightly injured and barely guarded the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this campaign, the entire Cangqing continent was shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day later, Richard captured the king's court of the Elf Empire: the peak of the Holy White, the golden world tree also fell for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf emperor fled to the western part of the western greenland sent a messenger and finally expressed his willingness to negotiate with Richard, but at the moment, talk about it, nature and Li Chachu’s early days. The mainland is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace talker seems to have received sufficient authorization to make a huge amount of compensation for the lion’s opening, and to ceduce a land with a natural harbor in the northeast of the mainland. Mengde, as well as surrendering three resource planes and other requirements, all agreed, and almost let Richard suspect that he was sitting in front of the real high elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Armistice Agreement was reached soon, although the Elf Emperor did not arrive, but this armistice agreement was signed under the Golden World tree and attached a golden world. The young leaves of the tree, which is equivalent to the guarantee of the golden world tree, even more effective than the signature of the Elf Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the "St. Baifeng Agreement" was signed, this is a strong agreement in the history of Archimonde, and the entire Nolan One of the important agreements in the history of Germany, the signing of this agreement means the complete decline of the Elven Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard and St. Druid signed their names on the agreement, the once-elf empire was gone forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha secretly sighs, there are only two silver moon elves he has ever seen, one is 茜, one is ilani, their names are very the same The strong and determined, Richard believes that if they are in the current situation of the Elf Wang Ting, then they would rather die and never sign such an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they are in charge of their administration, there should be no mistakes such as the elf empire that begins unreasonable arrogance and eventually bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that Richardson took out the heavy chips such as the golden world tree branch to exchange the footprints of the saints, that is, the silver moon elves are also the elves of the elves. Part of it, only though Richard expected that the entire exchange process would not be very smooth, but did not expect that it would not go to this point, Richard started from the sea, all the way to the Elf Wang Ting, this got what he wanted s things. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, the "St. Baifeng Armistice Agreement" was signed, which also means that Richard’s battle in the green continent has come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s harvest was huge. In addition to the footprints of the saints, he also received more than a dozen precious materials handed down from the era of the Elven Empire. These materials are even barely used as the main material of the sixth-order structure. Richard also got the seeds of a golden world tree, plus a basket of golden world tree leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These leaves, although not as varied as the young shoots, are extremely useful for the mother's nest, which can greatly accelerate its ability to the world tree and the tree of life. The progress of the analysis, the basket of leaves, the green capacity of the mother's nest can increase two more per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet is already on the way back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie is sitting in the flagship cabin, right now in front of him, with two silver pages and a long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two pages are the footprints of the saints that record the abyss from the abyss to the Abyss. After getting the footprints of these two pages, Richard realized why the Elf Emperor did not agree to the exchange at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Empire first explored the abyss at great cost, and finally found the path to the Abyss and confirmed the Abyss. The coordinates, and then the power of the country to create the door of the super artifact in July, omitting the steps from the abyss, breaking through countless obstacles, directly into the Abyss abyss, and finally found a passage to the dark side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Abyss abyss is located in the deepest part of the world, so it is so easy to break the space into it, that is, the door of July, only for one round trip, After the success of this trip, the door of July was exhausted and broken. The first and only super artifact in the history of Noland was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are stories that have long been recorded in history, so Richard’s trip is to get the route along the abyss, he doesn’t have that much. Resources will build a door to July, and Richard has two mother nests, and it is a better choice to move along the footsteps of the Holy One. But now Richard understands that the Elf Emperor refused to exchange at first, not only because of the value of the abyss route recorded in the footsteps of the Holy Spirit, not just because This is proof of the peak of the Elf Empire, or because of the two silver pages themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
