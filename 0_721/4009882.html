			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s face is already gloomy as to drip, he reaches out Remove the residual pages of the book that was carried and unfold it. A faint yellow magical spurt erupted from the pages of the ruins, covering most of the bar. Anyone who was within the magical glory of the movement was immediately slowed by three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a level 5 magic, the group is slow. Since the main tone of the trip to the Blue Water Oasis is a transaction, Richard's reserve magic is also replaced with a group battle aid in time, rather than a group war attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is very good, not only the several big men who have come to the action suddenly slow down, even the alcoholic people who want to stand up in the back of the table have presented a weird posture. Obviously at least in this bar, except for Richard, no one can resist the magic of the fifth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the chopper above the head, Richard also turned a blind eye. He believes that Gangde, who has also ignited the power of the earth and the outbreak of power, will not be able to deal with a chopper. Sure enough, Gangde flew directly and slammed on the attacker's face. In a densely cracked bone, the attacker flew over half of the bar and smashed three or four tables before falling to the ground. I saw his body twitching, but did not see him stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde took a bottle and smashed it on the head of the nigger. Although it is an ordinary bottle, the power in the hands of Gangde is quite different. The black ghost swayed and fell to the ground. Then Gangde stepped on his left hand, and the boots slammed hard, and the sound of broken bones came from the bottom of the boot. The screaming of the nigga immediately overwhelmed all the sounds in the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now no one can care for the nigga, the elf poet pulls out the short sword, has thrown into the crowd, and the strange and sturdy swordsmanship is put down. Two big men, and took over an iron rod, and then tried to squat on the back of another big man. Although the lethality of this stick is far less than his short sword, whether it is a muffled sound or a splash of blood, it is much more exciting than a short sword! Moreover, Olal used the power of the whole body when he spoke, and even the mouth was somewhat distorted, so that people saw the dark side of his elegant appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One stick stumbles the brawny, Oral is still unsatisfied, the iron rod is waving like a fly, and a stick sticks his face and falls on his face. On the body of the strong man, the stick is flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he madly vented, his voice suddenly came cold and cold: "Let it open!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral is a chill, instantly awake from the violent state, and quickly retreats. The figure of the girl has passed by where he just stood, and the surrounding brawns stopped as if they had suffered a nine-level magic time, and all the movements were in the same place. Then, at least five or six heads flew into the air, and the blood spattered like rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, almost no one saw when the girl was out. The figure of the water flower is clear for a moment, and the perpetual guide in the hand has already pointed to the alcoholic drink of another table. After the people and the slow magic struggled for a while, they finally stood up. Most of them held weapons in their hands. They also copied a bottle of wine without weapons. Obviously they had to fight, but they had not had time to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls will move forward and the heads of these people will fly to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Splash, don't kill them." Richard's voice came from far away, letting the girl who had already taken a half step stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at the bar, and the other step-riding knight he brought had already knocked down his two opponents, and the hand was directed at the joints. The opponent immediately lost his ability to move and was destined to leave a disability. There are more than a dozen alcoholic drinkers in the bar. Most of them are exposed to fierce light. They are interested in participating in the war. Two or three people are trying to sneak out. It is obvious that they are not in a good situation. They intend to ventilate the news and go to the reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Li Cha said: "Shuihua, if you want to run, cut off your right foot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail of Richard is not falling, the girl has Since the bar wall came back around the circle, the few who were ready to escape ran two more steps, and the right foot suddenly fell off the body. They couldn't help but fall down and get dizzy, then the legs were sorely painful, and they immediately yelled at them. Before waiting for the next order, the girl rushed to the enemies who took up the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a time bar, the broken limb is flying, the left hand takes the weapon's broken left hand, the right hand takes the weapon's broken right hand, the girl's gaze and knife are extremely sharp. Of course, the most unfortunate thing is a big man who picked up his hands and heavy axes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a breathing effort, the girl has done everything, re-flashed the original seat and sat quietly. The director of the eternal sleep does not know when to return to the scabbard. This killing blade will never be stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s movements are too fast, and it’s too late for Richard to stop or change. Although the culprit drinking in this bar has a strength of seven or eight, but in the face of a girl with ‘dark breathing’, they are even more vulnerable than the lamb to be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and suddenly threw out the glass in his hand, and the wine glass that could hold a liter of spirits crossed the bar with a sharp wind, thinking On the face of the bartender who was going to sneak away, a bang broke into countless fragments. Scarlet liquids are flying around, and it is already unclear whether it is wine or blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned over and jumped into the bar, grabbing the bartender’s hair and dragging him back. The resistance that he encountered when he started was so small that he was slightly surprised. The initiator of this bloody case was just an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender screamed with a very sharp voice, constantly saying: "I am a stupid person! If you dare to move me, you will die." Ok! Sidick will grab you all and chop up the dog that feeds him! The two women can live for a while, and there are hundreds of men going to fuck you every day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of words, no wonder it’s just a bartender." Richard took the bartender and pressed him to the bar, then pulled up his left hand and pressed it on the table. Let Gangde come over and hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender was even more screaming, and this time he seemed to feel that things were not so good, struggling, and kept saying: "Stilke adults have The most powerful horse team! If you put me out now, this is the case fornight. Otherwise, Sidick will kill your whole family!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat down on the bar and couldn't help but laugh when he heard the bartender. "If the Stilk adult can find my family, I really have to thank him! Now, let you know about it. Everything in the red Cossack tells me that no word can be missed, and no word can lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the bar has subsided, the body is full of dead bodies And the wounded who are squatting, the blood flows into the river. There are not many people who can still stand still, most of them are waitresses, and there are a few people who are smart enough and quick enough to respond. They left their weapons in time, squatted on the ground, and did not escape, only to escape the knives of the ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard did not make any threats, the bartender was pressed to the left hand that was forced to spread on the bar, and the answer was revealed. The bartender finally trembled and tried to make the final threat: "Stilke adults will not let you go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
