			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman just rushed over and she came into contact with Richard. His eyes turned out to be a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman suddenly screamed: "Go to hell." The double-knife smacked to Richard's throat and stabbed his lower body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s shot yīn is dangerous, but the double-knife is extremely accurate, and the trajectory is clear and smooth. From this point of view, she is actually in the dark area. There are a number of strong people, the mastery of the twisting rules has reached a considerable extent, roughly control the three or four rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this level is nothing in the eyes of Richard. He draws the moonlight and slashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman lost her sè, desperately retracted her double-knife in front of her, but the moonlight passed by, and the double-knife was cut off with her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chawan is floating on the water, passing by with the woman, walking to the big man, Dahan’s eyes were surprised, then became savage, big With a bang, pull out the short-steel spear behind the back, use the spear as a stick, and squat down to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel spear is on the ground, splashing a large spark, the whole spear body is distorted, and the hardness of the wasteland ground actually exceeds the Lafite jīng iron. The big man is crazy, leaving a little white spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel spear squatted on the ground and bounced high. The big man couldn’t hold it anymore, let it fly out, and he stood still. After a while, I finally fell down, and the blood flowed silently from under him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the deep pit again, and those people were still around the pit, excited to keep calling, if the core black liquor could not be touched at random, They have already jumped into the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stepped up and quickly circled behind them, everyone was pierced through the heart and slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took all the belts on their wrists and collected them, and collected the core black liquor in the deep pit, and cleaned up all the materials on the battlefield. Then stood in a mess and sighed softly. In fact, according to the tradition of the dark region, Richard was still the last and most important step, that is, the bodies of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butchers can't eat, and the source of people's food is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha silently launched the power of Isaac’s real name, the extremely light tetrahedron appeared in his body, and several soul light spots emerged from the body. Into the soul of Richard, when Richard was ready to take back the power of his real name, there was a sudden shock around him, and there were countless souls floating slowly out of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked in his heart. When he looked closely, he found that these spots were floating from the butcher’s wreckage. It seems that in the past few years, those The souls eaten by the butcher, the soul has been imprisoned in the butcher's body and can not be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has killed nearly ten butchers, each of which has hundreds of thousands of souls, and more than a thousand souls. They are all the souls of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless spots of light converge into the light river, pouring into Richard's body, constantly impacting his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a click, the ground where Richard stood was suddenly cracked, and his feet were deeply stuck in it. So many powerful souls, so Richard Some are unbearable, and many forces can't control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the absorption of the soul by Richard is limited, but a large number of souls can’t stand the light, and the hovering around Richard is not willing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took seven days for Richard to absorb all the souls and make them part of their real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tetrahedron has been clearly solidified a lot, and when the last soul shines into it, it fades away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his eyes, an invisible force wave rushed into all directions, sweeping a hundred meters, everything in this range quickly Fas è, pale, turned into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the wilderness, only the soul wood and the deep pit under the soul wood are left, but there is no core black liquor oozing out at the bottom of the pit. All the butchers and core black liquor in the vast area have been consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is someone who knows well, it will feel that Richard seems to have changed, but where the change is, no one can say it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard cut down two branches from the soul wood and cut it into usable wood, he walked behind him and walked toward the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Richard returned to the city and went to the courtyard where the white bear lived. The white bear is lying in his room at the moment, doing nothing, in fact, this is The life of most people in the dark area is not lying still, just wandering around, they just want to do something, and there is nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard entered the room, he was angry in the eyes of the white bear and jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Bear, there is something you need to help me." Then, Richard opened a piece of paper and marked it from the city to the beginning. The route map of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the town I passed when I first arrived in the dark area. I hope that you can go there once and bring them something to the past. This is some equipment. And materials that can make people there safer and richer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put a parcel in front of the white bear, which does have a lot of equipment, There are some pure water and food, half of which are obtained from the team that wants to rob Richard, and the other half is taken from the butcher's wreckage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bear saw the package, and there was a trace of greed in his eyes, but he immediately suppressed the greed and began to study the map seriously. After watching it for a while, he shook his head. "No, it's too far. I can't walk that far in the wilderness, and there are butchers in that direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The butcher there has been me Killed, you don't have to worry about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s words almost made the white bear jump. He didn’t think that Richard was lying, so he was even more shocked. When I looked at Richard, I couldn’t help but step back, until I slammed into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing the butcher, at least the white bear has never heard of such a thing, but it is said that some extremely fierce teams that have long been hunted in the wilderness have Kill the butcher's record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha handed the white bear a belt and a small piece of bean-sized black sè grease, saying: "These are for you, with them, you You can go through the wasteland and send things to the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the skin of the beast, and the core black liquor." The white bear can hardly believe his eyes. The belt made of animal skin has stealth and resists the twisting rules. The core black liquor can directly promote the twisting rule. With control, with them, they can indeed cross the wasteland, and these are the rewards that Richard has given him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this small piece of black liquor, the vast majority of people in this city are willing to do anything, let alone small things like crossing the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the town, Richard also put aside his mind. He left the courtyard and walked to the city center. There is also a city inside. The wall, just surrounded by the second layer of order light curtain, the inner city is not big, just like a manor, Li Liang shines the soul wood in his hand, and he is qualified to enter the inner city and meet the city owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city owner is named Simon, who is said to be a super strong person before falling to the dark area. He has been in the dark area for nearly a hundred years, in this city. It was the invincible existence, and he successfully ignited the second pot of time fire decades ago, built a second order light curtain, and gradually built the city that was only slightly larger than the town at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon has its own courtyard and lives in the only four-story building in the city. As the city owner, he also has his own guard, three The ten-man Guard is the strongest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Simon was sitting under the throne at the end of the hall, looking down at the Richard below, and eagerly touching the short hard beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has placed the trimmed soul wood on the ground, and the two piles of soul wood are not particularly large, but there are quite a few, these soul wood It is enough for the order of the whole city to support the light curtain for several years. Even if the forces of Simon want to go out to collect the soul wood, it is impossible to gain something without paying a few lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come up with this, just to take a look at the fire of time." Simon asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have two fires of time here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "If you can look at it, of course it's best, if you can't, look at the old one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
