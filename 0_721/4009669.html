The first thing he woke up was to rush out of the bedroom and look for his mother. When she saw her mother in the study, Richard immediately rushed up and shouted: "Mom, guess what I got in the temple of the goddess of the moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ilanie turned and gently touched Richard’s head and asked: “Let my mother guess that my Richard has always wanted to be a magician, so you must have got the 'element affinity’ ', isn't it?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stunned because he turned to a woman he had never seen before. However, he has his own method of identification. He sucks his nose and sniffs the familiar atmosphere. He hesitates to ask, "Are you a mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "My Richard, this is what my mother would have been. Mother can't look good?" Elanie asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard nodded hard and said: "Mom is the best!" In his mind, mother is the most beautiful woman. What's more, now that Ilane has restored her original appearance? The silver moon elves are beautiful and beautiful, but they are also famous for their magical magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patience of the boy is always limited, and the patience of the teenager is not much increased, so Xiao Lichao is not in a hurry to wait for Erani to guess twice. Busy said: "Mom, I got wisdom and truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" Elanie was surprised, she knew it, but she never heard It has been said that there will be real power in enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Licha frowned and tried to explain with the new wisdom of ascension: "Real is... well, you can understand the world's ability more clearly. It is good." It can be promoted. It is of little use now, but it can make me look farther and hear more clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilanie snorted Supporting Richard's shoulders, he carefully cherishes the ability gained from enlightenment, and remembers the teachings she taught him. Her embarrassment was a bit embarrassing, it took more than an hour to finish, and many words were repeated and repeated, making Little Richard secretly making faces to protest. Xiao Li was originally very clever, with superb memory and improved wisdom. Nothing needs to be said for the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilanie finally found herself too embarrassed, so she smiled and asked, "My Richard, want to meet your father?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and tried hard, but couldn’t think of an answer. When he didn't think clearly, Elani said, "You will see Dad soon. The people he sent should be coming soon. They will take you to see him. You have to obey and remember on the road. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" This is a very unexpected news. Richard didn't know how to react, just nodded and ignorant, then Just think of one thing and ask: "Was that mother, do you go together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Mom doesn't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will not go!" said Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilanie smiled and said, "My Richard is going to go because my mother still has a wish that you need to help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard straightened his chest: "Mom is relieved! I have grown up and will do it! Oh, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilani Looking deeply at Richard, he slowly said: "If one day, my Richard becomes a real big man, then I will bury my mother in my father's family graveyard, the highest level!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard nodded hard. At this time, he still does not understand the true meaning behind this wish and the difficulties it has achieved. But even if he knows, he will not back down. The boys in the mountains will never lack courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of Rutherland Village has always been very quiet and serene, but the tranquility of this morning has been broken. First, the ground of the entire village began to shake inexplicably, and then the vibration became a sharp shake. Even the slowest old man felt that it was wrong, so he walked out of the house and looked at the end of the road outside the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the mountains is still a bit chilly, and when it blows through, even the most brave and strong hunters can't help but chill. They don't feel the temperature is low, but they have an unstoppable chill from the bottom of their hearts, as if there is an irresistible disaster. The earth is still shaking, and all the people in the village of Rutherland walked out of the house and silently stood on the open space at the entrance to the village. From here you can already see the smoke rising in the distance. In the forest, there are still old trees roaring down from time to time. The birds in the forest have already been flying high. They don’t even dare to stay in the nest and fly directly to the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonic heavy armor rides out of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black body is full of more than ten steel thorns on the heavy armor, and the chest is carved with a horrible devil head, and the armpit The horses are extremely strong, half a meter taller than the Mustang kings that the mountain people have seen. The horses are covered with thick horses, and the sharp steel spurs on them show that it is not just for defense. The left side of the horse is hung with a giant sword. The style is a common horse sword. The unusual thing is that it is a whole meter longer than the ordinary Hummer sword, and it is much thicker. The weight of the weapon is at least one hundred kilograms, and the power of waving is almost unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain road with the gravel as the base is squatting under the iron hoof of the horse. The horses are smashing through the iron hooves, the gravel is flying, the soil is splashing, leaving a deep pit, directly exposing the mud under the pedestal. Behind the Cavaliers, there was another team of twenty-five heavy cavalry, followed by nearly one hundred light cavalry. Even the light cavalry is equipped with well-made full-body locks. More than half of the cavalry is equipped with a magical longbow with flashing light. The equipment is extremely well equipped. Such an army is enough to capture the castle of Baron Tucker, but at this moment it is rushing to the small Rutherland Village at full speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the village head, everyone is pale. The hunters are brave, but the brave hunters know that they can't resist the knights who are armed to the teeth. The village chief even saw unusual signs from the extraordinarily tall war of the first knight. The experience of the military has taught him that only a knight can build such a tall horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading knights rushed into the village of Rutherland, slamming the horses, the giant warriors stand up, the front hoofs fall down, and they hang out on the ground Two shallow pits. When the war horse stopped, the hot air spewed from the nose had already rushed to the village chief's chest. The knight picked up the helmet's face and revealed a firm, majestic face. He swept coldly across the villagers in the square and asked, "Who knows where Ilani lives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers face each other, there is no village in Rutherland A woman named Elani. The blacksmith and the village chief remembered something but did not speak. The Cavalier's face became more gloomy. He just wanted to talk. The pharmacy door that was not far away suddenly opened. Elani came out from the inside and asked faintly: "Is it sent to you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight stared at Elani and looked at him. His face suddenly changed. He suddenly jumped from the battle and fell in front of Elannie like a flying iron mountain. He kneel down and took the helmet to reveal the whole face. Half-low head, Shen Sheng said: "I am the former Knight of the Gordon, the Knight of the Order, and come to pick up the wife on the orders of the adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modred had a short red hair with a steel needle. Although he bowed his head in front of Elani, but the momentum was unstoppable, the whole magic pharmacy was trembling under his majesty. In his huge body, it is like a volcano that can erupt at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilani’s dress also fluttered, but she did not retreat, standing in the airflow, nodded and said, “You are there, Then I am relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred grinned and said, "Thank you for your compliment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilanela’s Richard, who put his little hand in the heart of Modred’s hand, said: “He is the one that Gordon wants most. He is called Richard... "A pause, Elani said: "... Richard Akmon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred looked carefully at Little Richard Then he closed his hand and gently shook his hand in Richard's little hand. He smiled and said, "Maudred is willing to help you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight Looking up at Elanyi again, said: "Respected lady, your things have been packed, let's set off. Gordon adults must be very eager to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still need to take something very important, wait for me For a while." After Ilani finished, she walked into the magic pharmacy and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Little Richard is looking at Modred, and this bloodthirsty lion-like knight is watching him, the two face each other, small With a big eyes in his eyes, after a while, Modred smiled again and didn't know what it was for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his smile suddenly froze on his face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames spurted out of every window of the magic pharmacy without any warning, and even opened the roof, and the flame of the spurt rushed directly over a dozen meters. high altitude! The flame was so fierce and sudden that even Modred did not notice it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers roared, a step, and they had already smashed into the pharmacy. The wall made of bluestone was no different from the cheese in front of him, and the raging flame Nor can it cause even the slightest damage to him. When he rushed into the pharmacy, he saw that Elaine was sitting elegantly, the flame was ejecting from every part of her body and burning everything in the room! Modred was stunned. He wanted to save Ilani, but he didn't expect all the fires to erupt from her. She was already burning herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mordred who rushed into the flames, Elanie smiled at him and then completely turned into flames, burning, sublimating, no more Leave any traces in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred stood silently, letting the fire lick his body. Illane’s last smile was deeply imprinted on his mind, the smile was so beautiful, so elegant, and so complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard screamed insanely, kicking and holding his own heavy-loaded knight, wanting to rush into the fire. However, all his efforts were in vain, and the flames were extremely fierce. In a blink of an eye, the entire pharmacy collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
