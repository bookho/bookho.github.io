			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Gul Zaba’s words, Richard’s face is very cold, 丕Ping. The occasional embarrassing attitude of Samson made him feel that the trip was not calm, but he did not expect a light agreement at the beginning, which contained such a heavy content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t imagine what kind of mood the mountain and the sea left in the past. For a long time, the memory of the farewell, the most lively is her sunshine. The smile, the hugs of the mountains, and the wave of no return. However, at this time, the real talent searched for memory in a grid, and finally settled on that silent gaze. The whole world sinks into the eyes, one side is an indescribable expectation, the other side is full of bitter despair, only in the deepest depths, only a little waiting for a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the distance and knew what to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe die..." Richard muttered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the boy who did not understand anything except magic and structure, but he has experienced the cruelty of the plane war and began to understand the use of political means. To weaken and combat the opponent's leader. He is very clear that even if the anger of the mountains and the sea is a constraint, it will not stop some people's adventures. The spoils behind it are too tempting to seduce the deepest greed in the heart. Nothing can stop this greed, maybe glory, but there are still people who will not be glorified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, those barbarian youth who are qualified to have children with mountains and seas do not need to do it themselves, as long as they instruct others to do it. This is a very simple means, the barbarian tribe is more like a star, and politics is also a must-have art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the double-knife and the destiny, carefully adjusting the equipment up and down until the counterweight reached his perfect plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when finishing the equipment, Richard’s heart suddenly floated a picture without warning. It was in the middle of the deep and holy temple, and the mountain and the sea were lying on the ground. On her, a strange barbarian strong is striking her, showing the male instinct in the most ferocious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's face is expressionless, her skin is slightly smooth and satin, but she is so beautiful and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Li’s eyes spurt two dark red fires! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture was just shattered, but the damn wisdom talent remembered every detail! The details are so realistic, so expressive, intuition tells them that they cannot be fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard’s heart sank, and when the picture floated, he determined that he had not activated any ability, and he suddenly appeared in the deepest consciousness. But the analytical talent captures the power of time that is almost impossible to detect. If he had some inexplicable absorption of some time, he could hardly detect the source. The heart of Richard is a heavy jump. Is this picture just like the original pictures, is it a certain piece that will happen in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of Archimonde in Richard’s chest is tumbling again, and the real name that just awakened bursts with a strong golden red glow, an indescribable destructive emotion. Constantly impacting Richard's mind, let him want to completely smash this continent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhausted all his efforts, Richard only controlled the burst inside his heart, and the magma flowing deep in the eyes gradually quieted in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished the equipment with his hands as steady as a rock, and said, "Let’s go, remember, don’t call other after you go back. People are coming. Come and die, I will not guarantee that I will not kill next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulzhaba is ashamed and angry, but he is simply defeated, he There was no qualification for refutation at all, so I screamed on the tyrannosaurus, and the soldiers who led the hurricane tribe whizzed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his left hand and looked at the bracelet of the animal tooth wrapped around his wrist, perceiving the direction, that is, going to the mountains and the sea at an unpleasant and slow pace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still far away from the mountains and the sea, and on this road will continue to encounter the attack of the barbarian youth strong, even stifling. However, Richard is determined to go down. No matter how far he wants to go deep into the mainland, no matter how many strong people need to be defeated, he will go on until he sees the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only wants her to know that she has the ability to look at her now, and on the date of the appointment four years later, she must have the ability to become her appointment. man of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four years is a very long time, with confidence and no confidence, it must be living in two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the mountains and the sea, Richard will immediately turn around and escape, leaving the mainland of Calando until he is promoted to the Magisters. He is not prepared to give the barbarian opponents any chance to use conspiracy. As long as Richard is alive, those who attempt to infect the mountains and the sea will have a thorn in their hearts for the past four years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard started again, in a place thousands of miles away, the girl was flying barefoot on the ground, and every time she fell, it would make the earth Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, a hill-like rhinoceros is running all the way, and the air is constantly ejecting in the nose, and apparently the physical strength is coming to an end. On the back of the rhinoceros, there are stone sticks of mountains and sea. If it is slightly out of direction, or if the speed is slow, the girl will kick a foot and kick the huge rhinoceros off the ground every time and drop it on the right track. Then the behemoth will follow the girl behind and act as a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the rhinoceros was lying on the ground, foaming at the mouth, saying nothing could climb. So the girl picked up the stone stick and continued to fly forward, and soon found a new elephant-like rhinoceros. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this vast expanse of grassland, there are many like rhinoceros, they are giants that even the tyrannosaurus is not willing to provoke, but they have to be regarded as a girl. The beast is used. Like a rhinoceros, the temper is fierce. Even if the girls communicate their consciousness directly through talent, they will not yield if they make clear orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the girls usually go down with three fists and they are served. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not get much quiet time, because behind him, he caught up with a group of knights. Apparently, the location of the 'Top Ten' of the Gurza Baba Youth Brave was not convincing enough to prevent the young warriors who had already set off in the tribe from coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, this time was led by a ‘top three’ warrior and successfully caught up with Richard who deliberately maintained his strength and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard was not polite. After half a minute, the 16-level ‘first three’ warrior left more than a dozen teeth and left in vain. Destiny Gemini is not only capable of increasing the amount of magic, but as a legendary staff, its material hardness is beyond doubt. If the stick handle is broken into the mouth, it is at least a dozen teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ‘first three’ warriors left only half an hour, and the younger generation’s “first warrior” of the treadmill tribe pursued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that these warriors of the Tengfeng tribe got news almost at the same time, only the "top ten" residence was close to the landing point, and it was the first to catch up with Richard. whereabouts. If you calculate in turn, the road behind will be very difficult to walk, and the coming will come one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard had just fought the 'top three' warrior, the 'first warrior' generously said that Richard could rest for an hour, he could even give Lee Provide water and dried meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not waste so much time, went straight to the war, ended the battle in one minute, and discounted the arms of the 'First Samurai'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, finally no longer see the warriors of the stepping tribe. However, an hour later, Richard was stopped by a group of barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is a wind-driven tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until dusk, Richard marched for three hundred kilometers, and battled the wind tribe for seven games, and overturned them from the twentieth to the first seven. Young warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is low, Richard has no rest, no sleep, only to have a few mouthfuls of water, he met the night wind tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the barbarian is still a warrior during the day, then the night wind tribe is the rogue of the barbarian. They are squadrons in the night, and any terrain on the wilderness can be their natural cover. Their weapons include short bows, spears and bone knives. The most deadly weapon is the blowing of arrows. All weapons are smeared with poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night wind tribe's warriors appeared around Richard, there was no young warrior to play the challenge, just a blow of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally sitting on the ground and closed his eyes to raise his spirits. When the arrows flew, he suddenly opened his eyes, and the depths of his pupils were quickly occupied by dark red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up in a word, made a few simple gestures in his left hand, instantly issued a magic shield and a ranged attack protection, in double magic Before the protection, the blow arrows that are known by the haze and not by the attacking force have landed. If the face of Li is cold and frosty, he will catch it and the long knife that has been inserted on the ground will be extinct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little electric light illuminates from the extinction spike, and quickly jumps along the blade to Richard, igniting a few electric lights, and then disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Richard is hidden in the dark. A cluster of spears roared and stabbed in the position where he was standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, a bloody flag suddenly splashed, and several night-earth tribe warriors trembled from the grass, took a few steps, then Go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rushes out of their bodies and is quickly absorbed by the thirsty earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee as a ghost flashes from the night, extinct and bounces a few times, lightly passing over the other few night wind fighters, as if not met Go to any obstacles. The soldiers were suddenly stiff and then trembled, and a large piece of dark red blood was applied to the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
