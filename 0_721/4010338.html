			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a big place on the floating island that the castle suddenly began to be completely renovated. There are not many empty spaces, but it has been taken up by more than 400 horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s magic ride showed unparalleled superiority at this time, they were neatly arranged, one next to each other, That is, they do not move or make a sound. Except for eating, they have no movements, and their digestive abilities are extremely horrible, and the excretions are surprisingly small. More than four hundred magical horses are arranged in a strict square, like an army. Seeing these magic rides, the two Gordons of the Gordon era were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, both of them saw Richard in the magic lab, and now this small laboratory has become Richard’s bedroom and reception room. , offices and laboratories, with many functions in one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are back, very good, we can leave tomorrow, let me see the time..." Richard walked to the map on the wall, the plan After a glimpse of the route from 浮 Shide to the Black Rose Castle, I turned back to a bright smile: "It is just the day before the deadline to arrive at the Black Rose Castle, Asiris, I heard that you are an expert in siege, then this Let me see your means, although I guess it is probably not used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summa and Achilles are both in the plane The basic military common sense of a person on the other side is there. Seeing the route and time outlined by Richard, I can’t help but face each other. It is almost a straight line drawn along the mainland road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of Richard not only did not put the guarding power of the Black Rose Castle and the support forces of Sauron and Goliath in the eyes, and even passed the territory along the way. The aristocratic private army did not look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris is not someone who can’t say anything, and now the road: "Mr. Richard, this road may be a few times." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded: "I know that this is just a few games. I am going to see what kind of standards Noord’s nobles are. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma and Achilles thought of the suffocating knights in the military camp, they stopped saying anything, at this moment, they From the body of Richard, I saw the shadow of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, Richard issued three announcements in succession. One of them was to inform all the lords of the original Gotton to go to the floating island to report to him, and to pledge allegiance to Richard. The deadline is fifteen days. If it is overdue, it will be regarded as a rebellion. Richard promised that as long as he swears allegiance, then everything can be done in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second article is to declare the personnel and branch family responsibilities involved in the looting of the riots during the riots in the floating islands. Richard will return the sacrifices in January, or give The equivalent compensation, otherwise considered a rebellion, will be crusade, any family that dares to accept and shelter these insurgents, as if to declare war with Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it is to declare that the family council is illegal and to be dissolved within a time limit. When Richard arrives under the Black Rose Castle, all the members who have not left the family council, Will be executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the announcement of three incomparable sings, and it’s a lot of time to provoke a lot of buzz. It’s even more hateful. And the two channels of the Royal, three announcements were issued three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of issuing an announcement is as high as 1.8 million gold coins, and Richard has made his voice sound all the way in this typical upstart. Every corner of the Holy Alliance, and people who hate Richard, or can not get the money, can not get the money burned in this stupid way, so their voices can not get their own castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the third announcement, Richard also attached a map showing his marching road map from 浮fer to Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gloomy Iron Throne, the Marquis of Sauron was out of state for the first time, and the angry roar filled the entire hall. On his territory, all the troops immediately began. Mobilization, the stable and low-key Marquis of Sauron, is ready to meet Richard in the strongest posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another dark brown castle, the Earl of Goliath just finished his wrestling with the beloved Earth Dragon and received three announcements from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant, who seems to have muscles in his head, immediately put himself in the big study room and studied the innumerable intelligence and magic maps. One day, then decided to mobilize all the troops in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many of the Earl’s staff who are actually the old people of Archimonde. They are not willing to see Archimonde’s large-scale civil war. At the same time, Sauron’s construction knight on Goliath’s hand is more than On Richard, they have been persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Goliath only said one sentence at the time: "If this little war is won by Richard, it is the next song." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who has been with the count for a long time immediately understands the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden was inherited from the Earl of the Earl, and Gotton had only a small piece of land. When he was young, Gotton sold the land directly to the brother. Leah, who bought a ride, armor and a piece of clothing for herself, became a free Archimonde warrior and began a legendary career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that from the beginning of the Yongye Forest, Gordon is as dazzling as the sun. Compared with Gordon, Avery and Goliath are completely bleak. Light, Alice is able to get quite a lot of attention because she is a young and beautiful woman, and Goliath has become the backdrop for setting up Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always like to say this: "Twenty years ago, Gordon’s brother was the count, but twenty years later, he was still an earl, and the song The great man has already..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golia is still the count, but it does not mean that he is incompetent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the entire Holy Alliance, there are very few people who can stand on the 20th level. At the same time, Goliath does manage the territory well, in the military. The achievements are more reflected in the private position, where Goliath has transformed the occupied land from the count to a kingdom and defeated all the major powers bordering and adjacent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant is actually a calm character. He received the orthodox lord education from an early age. He walked step by step and was very solid. What is rare is that he is also in personal force. There is no ruin. If he does not have a younger brother named Gordon, he can become a hero in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s style is like his horse named “Dark Moon Black”. If there is a storm, he will always be in war, always in the war. Expansion, always creating a miracle, he is full of energy, from the perspective of fatigue or depression, and has not lost confidence in the most difficult circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon also played defeated, and when he was chased and killed, the most words he said to follow the knights was "losing, just not paying back, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the followers thought of going down to the account of His Highness, and all of them were not chilling, and suddenly they were soaring, and it’s not right to look at Gotton’s appearance. The debt is not as calm as it is, or how he always rushes to the front when counterattacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is easy to borrow money from the legendary mage, and not only the song, but the thirteen knights who want to borrow can also borrow, how much can be, really even interest If you still can't, the consequences are not so terrible. They swear by the knight's reputation when they borrow money. They agree with the legendary mage that they can get rid of all the debts as long as they streak around the dark blue on the day of fate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they would rather die in the end than to owe debts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more brilliant Gotton is, the more tragic those who are destined to become backgrounds. All the achievements of Goliath seem to be used only to set off Gordon’s Wei An. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Gotton, who was wandering on the edge of the cliff, lost his foot, and with most of his followers, the Cavaliers lost in the face of Qi Qi, and then Richard returned, this The young and young boy gradually showed amazing talents in the following days, and gradually stabilized the situation until it broke out, but no one thought that Richard would be so shocked once it broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon is gone, but Richard is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemies of Archimonde feel the same headache, and the background inside Archimonde does not want to continue the tragedy of the past, this is the determination of Goliath The origin of the. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midsummer month, Richard led his army to leave Faust and began an expedition to the Black Rose Castle. This so-called legion is actually five Hundreds of people, including one hundred and fifty knights, three hundred elite knights, and followers, priests and mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred iron rides roll south, according to Richard’s announcement of the world’s marching route, straight to the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days of leaving Faust, there was a new camp in front of Richard, and a whole 5,000 elite soldiers were waiting for it, obviously not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
