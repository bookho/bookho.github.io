It is now completely ** state. The infinity is extremely beautiful, and the body is slim and has extra richness. This is a near-perfect proportion of the body, with a regular atmosphere in every inch of skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath is particularly damn tempting for Richard, who is approaching the abyssal lord. Suddenly there was a man's reaction, and the impulse was extremely strong, and it hit the hidden part of the indeterminate leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sent out an extremely pleasing **, and no fixedly opened his eyes, exclaimed: "No, no! Ah!!!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Richard has seen her horrified, and is completely different from the bloody madness of rì. The strong contrast has spurred Richard, and he has rushed forward and has entered deep into the depths of the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No body stiffness, sputum, hands on the back of Richard's back to death, leaving a few bloody wounds. But the pain actually provoked Richard’s fierceness. He firmly held her, and hit her most tender part like a storm. The wild impact made it impossible to bear, and it always sounded from the depths of the throat. Extremely hoarse cry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Richard more excited! The weaker she is, the more she can't stand it. The more she is forced to rush, the more she will resist her last, and the last dignity will be completely crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, if the body is exerted, it is necessary to fly Richard. However, at this time, Richard’s physical strength has recovered a little. When the next sneer, the body suddenly multiplied several times, plopped, and firmly pressed the underside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see how you move again! Move! Move!" Richard is as wild as a beast, and at the same time more hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is like a boat in a storm, suddenly falling and falling, completely unable to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was sprinting, he decided to spur the last strength, and the lower abdomen received a twist, and he wanted to force the weapon of Richard to be twisted down. ! As a result, she only felt that she was twisted on a steel column that was burned red, and she continued to force several times. She couldn’t get the steel column, but it was hit by a few times, completely smashing the last point of condensed physical strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her strangulation was not fruitless, and Richard suddenly made a burst of low screams, suddenly tightened, and the weapon continued to penetrate her body. At the deepest point, the hot torrents then spurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feelings of their moments are all concentrated on each other, and they have not noticed that outside the door of the dormitory, the turbidity is standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity originally wanted to break into the door, but I heard the strange sounds in the hall, especially occasionally there was no way to say whether it was pain or pleasure. The hoarse voice, the turbidity of the originally rushed body stopped in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened for a while, his face suddenly showed a happy and worried expression, and then slowly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the intact building on the entire floating island of the royal family, except for the transmission array, left only the lonely temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone on the floating island has been evacuated, and even the transmission array is unguarded. No one can intervene in the battle between No. and Richard, even if it is close to the battlefield, it is extremely dangerous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not fordefinite and Richard’s conscious use of the extreme force that the plane can withstand when fighting in Noland, this floating island has long been thoroughly Destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity flow took a small step, and at the transfer array, he randomly found a large stone to sit down, and then found a beautiful silver wine from his arms. The pot, open and take a sip. Then I began to sing a little song, a leisurely look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the ray of light in the transmission array, the president of the Royal Masters Association, Tol appeared. He didn't know how many layers of magic protection on his body. He held an ancient staff with his hands crossed and bowed his cat's steps. He was as careful as a mouse that wanted to steal rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Thor just stepped out of the transmission array, he saw the turbidity, and suddenly he almost got into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was clear that it was turbid, Tol patted his chest and glanced at the lonely hall in the distance and asked, "Is the battle over?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity smiled and said: "Of course not! Just that was just the first half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolton was shocked: "There will be a second half?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid stream laughed and said, "Yes! The second half is more intense!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor’s panic: "That, that...this floating island..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing! If the floating island is ruined, Favord can regenerate one. You should go back first, and you will not want other people to watch it when you fight. Go back and tell others that you are not kneeling. Allow, whoever dares to embark on this floating island, killing it!" Turbidity smiled and said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Thor’s face was a little embarrassing at first, but he nodded and left the transmission. He is very clear about the turbidity of the flow, the more he laughs, the more he moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the temple, Richard and he were lying side by side, looking at the ceiling, even though there was nothing to decorate. The ancient dome painting was long destroyed by the aftermath of the battle between the two sides, and the decoration of the four walls was completely erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no two people moving, Richard does not want to move, no decision is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence in silence, I broke the dead silence and said, "Why don't you kill me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiled and said after a while: "Let's do this, let me start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not killing Su Helen’s murderer?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said, “There is a reason for you, but it should not be all, not even the main part.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No turning around, ask: "What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the place where the stone man may appear, see if there is a teacher Clue. No matter what she is... now, I have to see it before I am willing to be willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing for a moment, saying: "I am going with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her and turned to look at her and asked, "Why are you going? In addition, even if you are willing to go, I don't dare to take you. Can't always guard against your sneak attack? Even if you watch out, can you guard it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course There is a reason. That is because I... that, Su Helun... Ah! Do you understand?" Suddenly, it became incoherent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is naturally confused: "I understand? How can I understand this? Wait, you, you should not want to play the teacher's idea?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stunned and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be put to the point of mind, but not to restore a generation of heroes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gathered up purple hair short hair, and struggled to sit up, said slowly: "This is normal. People like us, the most attractive It’s not the appearance, the background, or even the race, but the regular taste of the real strong. Just like you just can’t control yourself, give me the same. Also, for the same reason, I don't hate you either. But I have to say that before you went to me, the excuse for yourself was a bit bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The momentum immediately weakened a few points and said: "I was thinking...that....."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First jiān killing ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard didn't know how to proceed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two met each other and did not say a few words to start playing. Richard originally wanted to ask things clearly, and the results evolved under the spur of murder. Into a life and death battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the edge of life and death, I have been swimming for a long time. Once I relax, I can't control myself. Just like the warriors after the war always want to look for venting. In addition, it is also true that the rules of attraction between the two sides are very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard was speechless, he did not continue on this topic, but sighed and said: "To the stars For men, Shi Nan is the key to evolution. By chance, I got the whereabouts of Shi Nan, but I couldn’t get in that place, I could only tell Su Hailun where the place was. The other creatures were painted. At that time, it was to prevent Blatter....."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened silently and gradually understood the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Su Hailun’s disappearance, he decided to take the risk to go to Shi’s location to see it. As a result, she did not go far, and she encountered several dangers in succession. Seriously injured, had to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back to meet Richard, I was actually destined to die, holding a mentality of dying. It’s just that no one else has thought of it. At the end of the game, it will consume both physical strength and then become a melee. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, when seeing that Richard has both the chaotic, orderly, and neutral power systems, he has no hope of reigniting. The place where Shi Nan lives is both chaotic and orderly. Perhaps only Richard has the ability to explore it in depth. And no one can be attached to Richard, as he goes deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sigh of relief and said, "How did you get the whereabouts of Shi Nan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is also a very intelligent person. When you hear a word, your eyes flash in the cold and say, "You mean...the scholar mages?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "Most of them are them. They have been staring at me and the teacher for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face sè gradually yīn Shen Going down, I resumed the blood-staining and blood-sucking sè, saying: "Then I think they are all tired. I heard that scholars have a lot of ways to reincarnate, it seems necessary to put their whole family. They all kill the light, so I can see how they are reborn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No orientation, Richard looked at it and said, "Isn’t it to cure me? You have been like this. Is it going to come again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
