			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just waved his staff, and Richard suddenly flew a foot, 狠狠Stepping on the belly of the young Druid, kicked him out and almost stopped breathing! Natural shields are naturally dead in the womb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Druid rolled up and madly waved his staff and desperately wanted to put something out. However, Richard’s figure was like a ghost, quietly appearing behind him, pulling his staff and gently pulling it, let him lose balance and fall to the ground. The young Druid instinctively vacated and wanted to turn over, but his body just bounced from the ground, he heard a crack in the bones, and then involuntarily made a scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the young Druid wanted to vacate, Richard simply stepped forward and stepped on his foot. He jumped like this, which is equivalent to twisting his ankle. This will almost completely break the ankle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Druid is still struggling, and he has no idea of ​​escaping when he releases the light burst, but just wants to fight with Richard. However, Richard is a simple and simple action, punching and kicking, pulling and pulling, and can be put down to the ground without a second action. Later, Richard became more and more calm, and his movements were more succinct. He often used a shot to push the teenager out of the meter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard realized that in the eyes of the white nights and others, in the past, his own step-by-step wizards were completely free to abuse. In front of the white night, unless you start to prepare after a distance of a kilometer, otherwise even the most simple magic can not be released, and even want instant magic can not do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instant magic also has a premise, it is impossible to achieve the heart free to move, the magic flow, the most basic release of magic energy gestures, this is a must of. Just like the young Druid who was now tossed in the direction of Richard, the young Druid, who couldn’t tell the direction, couldn’t even do the instant magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the opponent holds a scroll or other magic item, there is no chance to get out. In this case, the only thing that can produce results is passive protection, such as the defensive magic array that was set up in the Master's robe before being hit, or a similarly thought-out configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard also understood why there was such a magical armor. There is a saying in the magical code, that is, the powerful magic, to hit the enemy to have power. And now that Richard feels that he needs to add another sentence, then the powerful magic must first be released to be called magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magical arm is the best choice to enhance the magician's mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Ning Die and not giving up, still struggling with the little Druid, Richard’s heart was filled with mercy. Seeing this boy, for example, seeing his former self. But he finally got out of the green, and now he has no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Druid screams angrily, of course, not a sentence, just an intermittent syllable and a word, to the effect that Richard is not allowed to die. . After such a long time, the language of the indigenous elves is not complicated. Richard has learned some words, and the rest of the spells with a language can be understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager may be mad at him, perhaps his mind is not clear, he even recited a curse, trying to transform himself into a jungle cheetah in front of Richard. Richard shook his head and let him complete the entire deformation movement, which was a step forward and stepped on his tail. The cheetah was struggling to jump forward, but the tail was firmly nailed to the ground, naturally planted on the ground, and fell heavily, unable to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard had dragged the knife, grabbed the cheekah's back neck, lifted it up, and slammed it on the trunk next to it. The cheetah whimpered, shook the ground, and restored the human form. He finally had no strength to get up, he could only stare at Richard, and suddenly laughed a few times and said, "You can't run away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Richard is not flustered at all, calmly said: "You mean the elf warriors who have just passed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile Druid was shocked Richard actually said their language, but his face was still fierce and shouted: "You can't escape it anyway. If you have the ability, you will kill me first, so you still have no loss."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and asked: "If they will come, it will already be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile Drew According to the shock, I lost my voice: "You...what are you doing with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can catch you, how can they run off?" If you don't come back, you can forget it, but who told you to summon them back?" Richard looked at the young Druid, and he seemed to be nailed into his heart. Finally, Richard finally told him the ending of the Elf Warriors: "There are nine back, and now there are two more alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time a few kilometers away, an elf warrior is running at full speed, and the wind that passes by the ear is like a knife. The blood on his body splashed, but I didn't know where it was. But he couldn't take care of the wound, just wanted to run faster, and then faster, so that the devil behind him would be taken off and the news of the companion's fall would be brought back to the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the speed that he has not had in his life, but the dangerous alertness is not scattered, but it is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, the water flower uses the mouth to bite the guide of the eternal sleep, the limbs are on the ground, running like a wolf, the speed is faster than the full speed escaped elf Also, every undulating figure is integrated into the shadow of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly got up and intercepted the escaped elf in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior abandoned the bow and took the knife. The whole person swims like a fish in the water, and comes to the water in the night. However, what he did not think was that the water flower was more suitable for the night and the forest than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pupil of the Elf Warrior, she clearly rushed to him at the last moment, but disappeared from sight in the next moment, only the forest was sparsely dense. Branches and leaves shadows. However, the fierce murder did not dissipate in the slightest, and swept through the void. The guide of the eternal sleep appeared abruptly. On the elf short knife, the elf immediately fell to the ground, and the girl had passed by with the elf warrior. On a branch that is traversing, it seems to have no weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one left." The girl sent a short message in her consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the elf warrior’s stiff body slammed on the ground in the forest, and blood flowed silently from under him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few kilometers away, the twilight is biting behind an elf warrior, although not catching up, but it will not be rid of. The elf warrior heard the scream of the distant young Druid, suddenly the flame flashed, pulled out the short knife at the waist, turned around and threw the long bow aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tall and handsome elf warrior with a navy pattern on his face that adds a bit of fierce charm to him. According to the Norland standard, he is a 13th-level warrior. Although he gave up the usual longbow, his fighting power is not weak in the middle of the night. The opposite twilight is only ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
