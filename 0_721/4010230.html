It's quite huge, even a strong warrior can't afford too much use. So the beast soul necklace is more used as a card or a life-saving means." The introduction of the old man is rare, not too fake. Modification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave Richard a lot of good feelings for him and said, "Okay, I want this necklace. How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man's gaze inadvertently swept through the black crystal iron badge on Richard's chest, his eyes flashed greed, but he immediately suppressed it. With a sincere smile, "200,000 gold coins, young magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly sinks, then nodded and took out two high The pure magic crystal is put down, and then the necklace is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t left yet, his eyes are on the shelf, and then he seems to inadvertently ask: “A lot of things here don’t seem to come from Nolan. The product of Germany."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said: "Your eyes are very accurate. Most of the jewelry on this shelf comes from the mainland of Calando, which is the soul of the barbarian. Their stimuli basically require blood or even the essence of life, which is not a problem for the powerful barbarians, but it is a heavy burden for the people of Noland. But from another perspective, they It is a powerful complement to the Norland style. At the most critical moment, they can be a life-saving means!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is just a faint smile . The old man’s words are somewhat reasonable, but they are biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calando Continental Barbarian Beasts are powerful, but that is based on the barbarians' special physique and cultivation methods. Most of the barbarian warriors are tyrannical and powerful, and can easily afford the consumption of the beast. However, barbarian warriors have also paid a price for this, and this price will take a long time to be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the lost life is lost, so the life expectancy of the barbarians is often much shorter than that of the Nolan. If the Nolander strong uses the Horcrux, the loss of life is even more serious. Therefore, this kind of beast soul device can only be used at the moment of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard did not break through the mystery, his expression has told the elderly a lot. The old man immediately laughed even more humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around the store and said, "I see that a large part of your supply comes from the mainland of Calando. It seems that you are very fond of the mainland of Calando. Familiar?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man immediately said: “How long is it familiar? Our family of the Sultans even has a small territory on the continent of Carando! It is rare to see the whole of Noland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The territories? Barbarians let you occupy their land? Also, how do you maintain two territories? The connection and domination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of Richard’s point is at the key point, the smile of the old man is more intimate, the answer is very detailed, gradually, Sarr The situation and history of the Xun family have surfaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of the Nelson family was born in the sea, and its ancestors were one of the first navigators to discover the continent of Calando. Then in the long years, the family of the Nelson family gradually relied on the secret route to Calando, traded between the two continents, accumulating huge wealth and purchasing territories, and gradually became the nobility of Noland. There is a square, the title has increased with the accumulation of generations. By now, Nelson is already a Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancestor of the family of the Nelson family occasionally saved the life of a barbarian at sea and sent him back to the mainland of Calando. Unexpectedly, the barbarian was noble, and it was a chief of a large tribe. In order to appreciate the salvation of the ancestors of the ancestors, he gave them a small island by the sea. The island is only a dozen kilometers from the mainland, with natural ports and plains. Since then, the Nelson family has built a larger fleet of ships between the two continents, and even established a transmission array on the island! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transmission to the mainland of Calando! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat of Richard’s heartbeat was unstoppable. This transmission array solved his biggest problem, that is, the long journey to Carando. The fleet had to drift to the sea for nearly two months before it could reach Carando. There was no accident. The time on board is almost nothing to do, and the time of Faro or Greenson is accelerating. Richard’s promise was to pick up the mountains and the sea, instead of being hit by the barbarians in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard has been working on the plane battle, raising his strength and power in the ectopic plane with faster time flow, waiting for the canon to step on the Caledon The day of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now there is a transmission to Carando! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t hold himself anymore. He has been to the absolute battlefield, and now there are magical armed forces in his body. The ability to be strong and bloody is not rare in the world. Richard has already had confidence in his own strength, and he has the idea of ​​going to the Calando continent in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, this time you can see the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not reveal the true emotions of his heart, but asked: "The relationship between the Millennium Dynasty and the Calandan barbarian does not seem very good. And your territory and The Millennium dynasty bordered and was not squeezed out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very sharp question, the old man said with a smile: "It’s more crowded? Originally we were Nelson The family was a member of the millennial dynasty, but since the dynasty war hawks were wiped out in the barbarian continent, the millennial dynasty had wanted to requisition our family's transmission array as a bridgehead to attack the Calando continent again. The patriarch finally refused the emperor. The request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very difficult decision." Richard said sympathetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s not tough!" The old man’s face suddenly flashed the perseverance that was inconsistent with the merchant’s breath, and he said categorically: "Our Nelson family has been for generations. They all rely on the communication of the two continents. The territory and transmission array in Calando is the lifeline of the family! The requirements of the emperor will completely sever the roots of our Nelson family in the Calando continent, which will ruin The whole of the Nelson! Let our family be the cornerstone of the personal grievances of the emperor? This thing, every Nelson will refuse! Today's Nelson is wearing a noble coat, but the pirate blood of his ancestors is still in his bones! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very brave decision!" Richard praised again and then asked, "So, did you later rely on the Holy Alliance?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s face was red, and he sighed: “This is also a no-brainer. I played a few times with the dynasty army, although the Nelsons were brave, but There are too many dynasties in the dynasty. However, it is not a trust, because eventually Nelson did not join. The Holy Alliance, but chose to become an independent aristocrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricardo was an accident, saying: "This is very unexpected, why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For freedom!" The old man is full of momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and smiled: "Is it going to survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old man's The face is red again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an essential difference between alliance and vassal. In the situation of the year, if Nelson joined the sacred alliance, then the millennial dynasty will never tolerate, and will do whatever it takes. The price completely wiped out Nelson. At that time, Nelson did not have a strong and powerful ally in the Holy Alliance. Once the war situation escalated, the Holy Alliance may not continue to support the squad at the risk of a full-scale war with the Millennium. Therefore, Nelson was declared an independent aristocrat, and he was neutral to the Holy Alliance and the Millennium. Family trade equality is open to the two empires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of the old man, Richard sighed softly. The wisdom and courage of the Nelson's family in the past was able to bring the Nelson family out of danger. The reason why it was able to successfully preserve the family, in addition to the support of the Holy Alliance, and the battles of the Millennium Empire must have hurt the Emperor, and finally looked at such a special Marquis out of the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man also sighed as if he had returned to the era when blood and fire burned together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing a sigh, the old man looked at Richard with insight into the world and said: "You care so much about the history of the family, it is not only for the sake of Buy a few barbarian soul devices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also laughed and said: "Yes. I want to rent a nobleman's transmission array, go to the card once. Rando Continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the black crystal iron badge on the chest of Richard and asked: "With your net worth, you should not look at Karan. What are the benefits of those specialties on the multi-continent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am going to Calando, just want to meet someone."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems a bit of a story! Is it a beautiful girl?" The old man's eyes were beaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee seriously thought about it, is the mountain and the sea beautiful? He never noticed this problem, but he felt very comfortable when he was with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...beautiful! She made me strong after a few years and went to find her, because if I were going to find her, it was said that all the barbarians The young warriors will come to challenge me. It is still very early in the five years since the appointment, but now I want to try it." Richard recalled, slowly speaking, and said more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s face flashed a strange look, and he was concealed without a trace. He immediately looked good and said, "This way, then I will be welcome. I can make you use the transmission array, the cost per trip is 250,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes!" Richard answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you ready to use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just recently, I am ready I will let you know. However, we need to re-introducing each other now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out to the old man and said, "Richard Ack Mond, temporarily the patriarch of Archimonde, the Holy Alliance Royal Architect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
