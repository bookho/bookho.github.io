			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard is sitting opposite the flowing sand, struggling with a face "I have been to the absolute battlefield and know the nature of the plane war. But I still don't want to have a war, or I don't want to have too many wars, nor right, I don't want unnecessary wars... Why do we always want war? For example, this time the war, I can't see any meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand wrinkled with small eyebrows, from time to time The book raised his head and stared at Richard, saying, "You, do you want to know the answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think!" Nod, not being scared by the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at yourself!" Flowing sand simply pushed the book of time to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the book of Time and found a blank page on the page. But when he looked at it with his heart, there was a line on the page: "You don't hit others, others will come to fight you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence is very rough, but it has a vague truth. But this sentence is the answer given by the book of Time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand reached out and turned the book of time over a page, and a line of words appeared above: "Only the winner is qualified to entangle the necessity of war." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha thinks again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, you have been too busy recently, juvenile!" Liu Sha retracted the book of time, said evilly. There is no meaning in her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat there for a long time, only then suddenly smiled at the sand, said: "A little understanding. However, there are many people who follow me now, I They can't let them lose their confidence. So, these words can only come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream of sand, a stomach suddenly disappeared, disappeared Very inexplicable. She bowed her head and turned hard on the book of time and said, "This is also... nothing. Anything is in the book of Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei stretched out The body, the face regained the sun, smiled and said: "Reassured, I know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the room of the sand, Richard went In the Magic Lab, Qi Qi is concentrating on drawing the composition. When she saw that Richard came in, she repeated the original dialogue with Raymond, but omitted the last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished listening and walked back and forth in the magic lab for a few laps before saying, "This Raymond is a bit interesting. That description about the giant war It sounds quite reasonable, but it is not all as he said. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stood still and looked at Qi Qi and asked: "These words, are you asking for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Qi Qi answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask why she would know what she was struggling with recently. At the end of the battle, I dragged Raymond’s loudly questioning scene, and many close people saw it. So Richard sighed and said, "珞琪, you are too smart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi met with Richard's gaze and said, "I am afraid of two things now. First, I am not smart enough. Second, you no longer believe in me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Li looked into the eyes of Qi Qi, but only saw the softness and perseverance of clear water, no matter how he looked at it, never wavered. In the end, he shook his head and sighed: "I was in the beginning... how did you put you in the bet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you owe me "Qi Qi said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Richard didn't know how to say her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spread a piece of construction material on his workbench, beckoning to call Qiqi, bring up the magic pen, and start drawing one on it. a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Array is a separate functional component, the first magic array is slightly more complicated than Qi Qi can now master, the latter is a More complicated than one. In the last few magical arrays, Richard’s magic surged and occasionally flashed magical light. Not only does the magic output require stability when drawing the structure, but it also requires a certain amount of magic as a basis. The last functional magic array requires fourteen levels of magic as the basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 stood next to him, engrossed in watching every detail of Richard’s drawing of the magical pattern, and he did not dare to miss it. Richard's hands were too stable and stable enough to make her wonder if it was a pair of human hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Qi Qi began to learn to make the structure, she really realized the unfathomable strength of Richard in the construction. For example, every magical array drawn by Richard is at the level of the textbook level and has not been able to pick any flaws. The reason why magic textbooks are extremely expensive is that they can't be bought with money, because the producers must at least reach the level of the great magician, and is a scholar-type master who has been engaged in magic research for many years. The reason why Solomon's Mage Master is famous is because many magic textbooks are from the hands of this pulse mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of twelve magic arrays, the difficulty is from low to high, until the last one is completed, and it is already two hours passed. Seeing that Richard completed the last magical array, Qi Qi’s tight heart finally came loose, and for a moment he was actually black and suddenly sweated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she set the god, she realized that for two hours, Richard had not even made the slightest mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He collected the magic pen and said to Qi Qi: "In the future, you will practice the construction in this order and practice a magical array. Next. Wait until one day you can complete the twelve magical arrays completely and without mistake. This design is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspected a design drawing on the experimental bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 only looked at the design picture, the heartbeat could not help but speed up, lost the voice: "Magic arm!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Learn it, you don't have to worry about how I think about you, because you will have strong self-reliance. Now, you have a chance to observe. I am going to draw again. A magical armed force," Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three days, Richard barely stepped out of the magic lab, only drinking a few times during the period. His whole body and mind are almost all invested in the world of construction, and so is Qi Qi. The sand has quietly come twice, and they have nothing to do. The gods then quietly put down a few bottles of water and left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Richard stood in front of the test bench and slammed his fist hard, making a roar that had been suppressed for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is another magical armed! And it is all in one go, no mistakes! The completion of this magical weapon means that since then, most of the third-order construction has no longer challenged Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the joy of Li, suddenly heard a plop, and it turned out that Qi Qi had already fallen to the ground, and it fainted. Richard checked and found that she was only physically exhausted, and she collapsed, so she let go of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took her to the bed and put it in, poured a bottle of vitality into her, and watched her fall asleep, leaving the magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out of the lab, the oncoming strong sunlight stabbed Richard and could barely open his eyes. It was already noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the thunderous roar of the ogre suddenly appeared in the military camp, almost half of the blue water oasis city. The roar of the ogre was originally big, and the sound of tiramisu was twice as loud as the ordinary ogre, because he was two mouths at the same time screaming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tiramisu, three-point cooked! You shut me up!" Richard, who was close at hand, was dizzy with huge volume and had to be angry. Roaring, and using magical amplification, finally pressed the voice of the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, sorry!" Tiramisu smirked his head apologetically, then sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little newborn’s head snorted and said, “It’s the most noisy you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu is furious: "It is your first call!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!!" Richard had to scream again. Only let the ogre quiet down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second head grows out, Tiramisu insists on calling him a three-pointer, and Richard has no objection to it, but he is sentimental in his heart. a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second head immediately accepted the name of the three-point cooked, and as it has grown for decades, it seems that wisdom is no worse than tiramisu . Richard knows that the two-headed ogres have only one soul, and the two heads represent different personalities. The ogre who really has two souls is the peerless powerhouse of the ogre, or a rare tyrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a double-headed ogre, the body of tiramisu began to grow again, now more than three and a half meters. He has to sit on the ground to have a smooth conversation with Richard. The reason why Tiramisu is so excited is the magical arm in the hands of Richard. At this time, the three eyes of the ogre's two heads are all staring at the structure of Richard's hand. The two sensitive noses have already smelled the power of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre seems to be awkward, actually because of appearance and habits. In fact, their wisdom is no longer human, such as the double-headed cannibal magician like Tiramisu, intelligence can be said to be smart according to human standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu stretched out his hand and carefully took the dress from Richard’s hand, opened his mouth, and smirked a few times, saying: “Head Child, with this thing, the guy from Gangde has only been able to detour since I saw it. If he wants to fight one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Immediately interface: "Surely he is like a rabbit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
