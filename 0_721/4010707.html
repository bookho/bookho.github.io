			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small episode in the war, Richard stood alone In the brain, flying too far, the result was seized by the imperial might, and the six towns of the country attacked and raided. As a result, a fierce battle in the air, six towns and strongmen died in battle, Richard No injury, and returned to the brain, calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu discovered that it is deeper than the strong ones of Tiramisu, Shuihua, Twilight, and Gangde, which make the Empire talk. Red Dagong Richard is the hardest one to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the gods of the mountain pass finally came to an end, the result of this battle is beyond the boldest imagination of all, the 400,000 army of the Iron Triangle Empire is completely defeated, and the defeat can no longer be more Thoroughly, hundreds of thousands of troops have been blasted out of the mountain of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole war, Richard spent a total of 500,000 explosive arrows, the price of each is more than one hundred gold coins, the main force of the imperial country, It is equal to the 50 million gold coins for the students to launch the Gods Cry Valley, 200,000 dead and wounded soldiers, each can share less than three hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army came out, Saranwell suddenly turned back and stared at the soaking mountain pass made up of two cliffs, only to feel the incomparable bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the voice just now is the end of the old era and the beginning of a new era. The former iron triangle empire is already the past, even if it is Faro. It will sooner or later become a thing of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew the messy hair of Salenwell and infused the cold into his blood and bone marrow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking the crying mountain pass, Richard gave Saranwell a 10,000-Principal warrior to guard the captives, so that he could complete the recruitment of the emperor as soon as possible. The various weapons and armor materials that were destroyed by the gods in the Shenqiu Yamaguchi were piled up in the mountains, and Richard was left to the disposal of Saranwell, so that he could freely use them to rearm the 35,000 imperial soldiers who surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard himself led the 15,000 cavalry, and once again took a break to start again, chasing the remnants of Li Shilongtu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu is an imperial star, constantly gathering the remnants in the process of rapid retreat, and sending people to summon the broken army, the preset assembly movement in the rear. In Richard's consciousness, after a few hours, I saw that the slightly larger squadron began to turn, and dozens of squadrons were moving in the same direction. There must be a preset assembly point. Out of the map of the Empire, I saw that there is a small town located there, the new assembly point is not far from the ice ice fortress, you can always get the support of the fortress guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when Richard measured the distance between the assembly point and the Shenqiu Mountain Pass, the corner of his mouth showed a sneer: "It’s only 85 kilometers, Li Shilongtu, you can’t afford to see yourself too much.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately placed a new order, not far behind him, the thinker wrapped in the black robe was received by Richard’s command, and after a moment he made a sharp sorghum The sound of the human ear is completely inaudible, and this sound can only be heard by the elite combat unit of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Richard began to accelerate slowly. After a while, he entered the state of high-speed Mercedes-Benz. The speed of the magic ride is far from being comparable to that of ordinary horses. The only disadvantage is that the natural life is too short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the army led by Richard is all equipped with magic riding, so there is amazing power, this machine power even exceeds Li Shilongtu's imagination limit, so an hour later, Richard caught up with Li Shilongtu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lichao cavalry appeared on the horizon, Li Shilongtu almost fell from the horse immediately. He took the opportunity to make a statement and said: "All infantrymen are blocking the battle on the spot. The rest of the cavalry and the mobile army regiment withdrew from me and went to the assembly point at full speed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu has 80,000 troops, more than half of the regular army infantry, they got military orders There is no indication of resistance or dissatisfaction, but immediately on the spot, preparing for desperate resistance, while Li Shilongtu leaves with full speed with a mobile force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Triangle Empire has four main army groups. Although it is an infantry, each soldier is equipped with a war horse. Unlike the regular knights, they are equipped with horses. Weight-bearing and endurance are known. This is the Mobile Army Corps. It is completely superior in the imperial concubine. Its status is second only to the only one of the reloading knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu’s decision is like a lizard tailing, sacrificing the second-line corps, to fight for the time and opportunity to escape, this is a very cruel decision, also Li Shilong The style of the picture is always on the real battlefield. The old marshal only has victory in his eyes. The vivid soldiers in his eyes are just cold figures in his eyes, but relying on this cold and ruthless, Li Shilongtu does not know in his life. How many talents were overpowered by him until he met Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand cavalry and mobile corps gathered in Li Shilong’s rush to escape, and the old marshal also ran wildly in the battle, when there was a whistling in the air, a town The country’s strong man flew by and fell to Li Shilongtu’s side. The town’s strongman was the marshal’s adjutant. He was left to see the next move of Li, and Li Shilong’s picture was not Richard’s. The flying beasts acted as eyes and ears, and wanted to monitor the movements of Richard. Now they can only rely on the figures of the township strongman. In the case of flying a large number of feather snakes in the air, the ordinary reconnaissance cavalry no matter how much it is thrown out. It is equivalent to feeding the feather snake food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people have been chased by Richard?" Li Shilong asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't send someone to come, I saw it with my own eyes, he used all the troops to attack the troops we left behind, and then, Li The followers of the investigation discovered me, I can't stay any more." The town's strongman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the generals, including Li Shilongtu, were relieved and were bombarded by the gods and rabbits like the rabbits, but in fact everyone’s heart They were full of unspeakable fears. The generals unconsciously slowed down some of their pace, and the marching speed of the surrounding army slowed down. When the extreme tension dissipated, everyone felt exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 40,000 troops left behind, and Richard has only 15,000 cavalry. The well-equipped heavy infantry is intensively held. How to fear the cavalry shock, and want to swallow the 40,000 people, Richard has to spend a lot of time, and at that time, Li Shilongtu should have gathered a group of remnants at the assembly point, and then withdraw to the ice fortress. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice Fortress is small in scale, has limited military capacity, and has not been built and expanded for decades. The empire that has always advocated offense does not like to Valuable military expenses are wasted on things like fortresses, so after a cold break in the ice fortress, Li Shilongtu is ready to withdraw to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Capital has not migrated since the founding of the People's Republic of China, bathing the glory of the Iron Triangle family to the crown of the country, the majestic city from the very beginning It was built according to the mode of the fortress. It has once rejected countless enemies from the high walls of the city. However, after seeing the power of the explosive arrows, Li Shilongtu suddenly lacked confidence in the defense of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Richard stood on the brain and looked down on the battlefield below. The 40,000 emperors were discharged into a dense formation, as if they were curled up. Hedgehog, however, this powerful and intensive defensive formation of the past has lost its effectiveness today. The blade of the knight is made toughly cut through and cut through, and this time the knight is followed by thousands of knights who will The bleeding wound cut by the knight was torn and expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are constantly striking the emperor’s array, cutting thousands of warriors every time they cut the cheese, and then the humanoid knights behind them Oblivion, Richard really only brought 15,000 knights, but these knights were made up of 11,000 human knights, 4, 12-level knights, and 200 strong knights and more than 10 powerful followers. Composition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
