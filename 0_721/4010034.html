			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield was quickly cleared and the spoils were counted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second-class caravan transports cloud iron ore, which is slightly worse than Lafite, but is also a good choice for weapons and armor. In particular, the weapons used to make them are very good for the magical load. From the perspective of cost performance, they are one of the preferred materials for enchanting equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cars and iron ore, although they don’t look much, will sell 150,000 gold coins to the human kingdom. Now it’s natural. The spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, war horses, recycled armor weapons are also worth tens of thousands of gold coins. The leather that was peeled off from the black wing caused Richard's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a leather armor made of dark dragon skin, with natural physical defense and shadow resistance. And three magic effects are added to the leather armor, including defense, concealment and powerful anti-magic. Among them, the powerful anti-magic is equivalent to two enchanting effects, and even in Noland, there are not many magicians who can attach this attribute to the armor. With four enchantments, this armor can be called sophisticated, even close to epic levels. Of course, the Sinclair double-knife has six enchanting effects, including the extremely rare enchanting weapons of ‘annihilation’ and ‘extinction’, which is the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked this piece of leather over and over again and had a general understanding of its value. The dragon dragon cortex is naturally strong, and the later tanning treatment method is also very good. It is not damaged in the continuous fireball of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this leather arm, Richard himself couldn’t help but feel lucky. If it weren't for him that he added a spell-penetrating structure to himself, the fireballs brought by boiling would not be able to leave the black wings so crisply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Richard called Olar and handed the leather to his hand and said, "This is for you, go back." I’ll be familiar with it later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf poet is also a good appraisal expert. The leather armor is very aware of it. After observing the perception, it is even more shocking. "No! Master, no! This leather is too precious, I can't. My identity is humble, it is not worth using such precious equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard intensified his hand and stuffed the leather arm into the hands of Oral. He said in a commanding tone: "Receive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... , Master." When Oral took over the leather armor, his hands were a little trembling. With the strong defense and magic resistance of this leather armor, he is equal to one more life on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, although you signed a magic slavery contract with me, but in my heart, I see you as a follower. So, hold with peace of mind. Said Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral was very surprised and could not help but look at Li. Followers are not a noun that can be used casually. In Noland, the term spit out from the aristocratic seal has a clear definition, accompanied by a series of rigorous and complete rights and obligations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the 13th Cavaliers are the followers of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the captives were also counted and held. Most of the more than 100 prisoners were caravans, and less than 20 people were still alive. . The killers under the Black Wings were also caught six times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These killers were surrounded by heavy-duty warriors, and there were cavalrymen with hunting guns on the periphery. They knew that there was no possibility of escape, so they had weak will and chose to surrender. Perhaps because of the fact that there are too many harvesting lives, the killer will of the killers is not comparable to the caravans of the caravans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what about this group of people?" Gangde asked the killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly in front of the six killers, and his cold eyes swept across each of them. In the eyes of these killers, Richard saw jealousy, fear and nervousness. But in addition to these, Richard also saw something else, it is a huge figure, a three-pointed shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard said: "They still use..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killers immediately loosened In a tone, I thanked Richard for his grace and swears that he will swear to play for Richard and must be loyal forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at them and said faintly: "You really have other uses, but not what you think. Sandru!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undead Master screamed out, staring at the six killers with turbid eyes, said gloomyly: "Six materials, but not good."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer's familiarity with the magician may be better than the warrior, one of them suddenly screamed: "The Necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The killers were all stunned, and then they struggled desperately, desperately trying to escape, and even wanted to die with the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the Undead Master is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the killer who has studied all kinds of magicians knows that being converted into undead creatures will not weaken or even The big opportunity is enhanced, but for the convertee, this process is extremely painful. It is the pain that the soul needs to bear directly. It is difficult to describe it in words. Compared with this kind of torture, it is the best ending to be able to die, although their souls are destined to be free from liberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gangde slammed all the killers by slamming a punch and kick. Then a team of barbarians carried the killers and followed Sandru. In the middle of the night, they will all become little pets of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Head, what about other people?" Gangde asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the rest of the prisoners, but wanted to kill him all, but he still hesitated, so he changed his mouth and said: "I am willing to surrender and become a slave. The surrender was put to death on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a dozen unruly guys were pulled out of the queue, and the sandman cut the skull with a machete. They all cursed Richard when they were dying, and vowed that the red Cossacks would come back to avenge them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sandman’s scimitar fell, more than a dozen heads rolled and flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this scene, Liu Sha sighed and said: "Is there these people, can the red Cossacks develop to today's scale?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark also sighed, and the wrinkles on his face became deeper: "Every organization that can survive in the blood-stained place has a soul. Soul, It’s such a person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the emotions of the two oracles, Richard is much colder, and he wants to repress his hatred. Can not call Shand back. Otherwise, according to his idea of ​​being a three-pointed corpse, all members of the red Cossacks should be thrown from the leader to the bottom of a porter, whether they are dead or alive, thrown at Sandru and let the Necromancer take them. The soul refines the energy of the undead spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
