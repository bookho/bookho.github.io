			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty Knights of the Temple have already settled in the floating island, so the overall situation has been fixed The semi-mandatory soldiers who belonged to the branch family no longer dared to pick up new waves. Their biggest patron, the Shuya Baron, left the floating island in vain. What else can they do? The agent of Count of Goliath still stayed on the floating island. As always, he did not show any attitude, nor did he intervene in any business, just watching everything quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Elvin was brought into the study, the three young boys and girls of Yan Mei stood on the left side of Richard, and Faschi stood on the right side. Richard sat quietly, gazing at the information in his hand. Elvin's face was pale, but there was a sigh of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Richard put down the information in his hand and asked seriously: "Irvine, the Marquis of Gordon has a place that can't help you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Archimonde family unable to hold you? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I haven’t waited for Richard to ask the third The problem, Elvin suddenly broke out: "I know you want to ask why! No reason, if you must say the reason, then it should be me to ask why! Why wealth, status, power and beautiful women are concentrated in you Hands? Why do I have to sell you life, go to the battlefield to fight? You gave me training, weapons and armor, but these are not all for me to go to the battlefield for you? I am no more noble than you. Master is strong! For example, if your old man is Gotton, why are you sitting here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled and shook his head. He pointed to three fingers and said: "You see, their Laozi is also Gotton, but now I can only stand here, and only I am sitting in this position... forget it, tell you this truth, too. I don't understand, or say, even if you understand it, you won't admit it. You, someone who thinks that others have something, you should have it, but never think about whether it should belong to you. Okay, Now, let's take a look at this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the information in front of him and read it line by line: "Sama, forty-nine years old, The title of the Cavaliers, the territory of the wormwood manor, covers an area of ​​0.2 square kilometers, with a population of 300. Ms. Lanney, forty-two years old, father is the Knight of Endo Archimonde, far from the Akmon family, but this There were no bloody awakenings in the two hundred years. The Sama Knight had three children, the eldest son, Irvine, 22 years old. The eldest daughter Lisa, 17 years old, the second daughter, 16 years old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?!" Elvin suddenly screamed, desperately trying to rush to Richard! However, the two guards had already been on alert, and immediately shot him and pressed him to the ground. Elvin struggled with desperation, his bloodshot eyes staring at Richard, groaning: "If you dare to touch the hair of my family, I will never let you go!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not express any emotions about the threat, and said faintly: "You can’t see it, you are very family-oriented. But you never thought about it. When every family in Noland has dealt with the first evil of the rebellion, there is always only one punishment, the genocide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare!" Break. He suddenly burst into anger and wanted to jump from the ground, but a guard immediately stepped on Elvin's lower back and stepped him to the ground. The guard stepped down and immediately broke Elvin’s vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two little knights, it is twice as much. You said, what am I afraid of?" Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin suddenly vented his breath and said in a low voice: "Richard, you killed me, let go of my loved ones!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s counter-inquiry made Elvin pale, he struggled, his throat A beast-like squeak. Elvin knows that the next step is to pronounce a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the information in his hand and said, "But, the genocide is too cheap for you. Your parents are still very healthy, so I will put They are sent to the bottom of the mine, mining and dig to death. And your two sisters, um, there are still portraits on it, it looks good, killing is also a waste. I want to turn them into slaves, then Sell ​​to a slave trader, how do you see it? Your other relatives are not in trouble, just kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mouth of Elvin’s mouth Grit your teeth, blood flowing from your mouth! He is very clear about what it would be like if his two sisters became slaves, and how cruel the mine’s underground black pit was. The slaves who were thrown there have rarely been able to live for a year. The disposal of Richard is even more ruthless than the genocide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irvine, the masters behind you, it seems that you are not going to save you. If you have the chance, if you cherish them, you fall in your In your hand, you will be more cruel! I have always pursued the principle of double retaliation, and now it is at most reciprocal. You should be thankful. Now, what else do you have to say?" ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irvine struggled to say: "Those sacrifices have been sold, I can give back all the money I got! Let go of my family, I will Tell those who are behind me and tell me! They are the real damn, they should be punished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "No need I already know who they are. This is no secret. I can't pick them up now, but they can't move me either. I can't fight with them right away. Are you disappointed? As for the sacrifices. If I guess it is correct, the one you grab will have to be sold to your masters. Otherwise, they will kill you like a slaughter dog. Well, time is precious. And the reason why I am willing to waste so much time on you is because you are vicious and hateful enough. I don't hate those behind you, because it is a normal conspiracy and struggle, although it is often the end of your life and death. But you are different, Do you know why? Because accomplices and traitors will always be more inferior than intruders. Remnant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood up, picked up a short sword on the table, paced back and forth in the study, his tone turned pale, saying: "Reassured I won't kill you, nor will I kill your family. Because death is just a moment of pain, I have not been tolerant to this point. I will torture you forever, let your soul struggle all the time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard made a gesture, a guard opened the side door of the study and pushed the cocoa in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco saw the scene in the study, an exclamation, grabbed his mouth, and his face turned pale. When Elvin saw cocoa, he began to struggle fiercely, and his mouth was still ambiguously groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly said to Irvine: "From now on, you will swear me another word, I will cut a knife in your family. Believe me Memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin glanced at him with a gaze, but he dared not spit out a swearing word. But obviously, he has cursed in the bottom of his heart, and I don’t know how many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Coco, and under his gaze, the delicate and weak girl shivered involuntarily, arms around her body. She subconsciously avoided Richard's gaze, and her eyes were filled with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and said: "Remember that Charles the Great, the founding father of the Holy Alliance, once said such a sentence, 'I can forgive mistakes, but never tolerate betrayal. '.Look at this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a piece of paper handed over by Richard, Coco found that the information written on his family and family. She had to think about it before she understood the meaning of the paper. The small face was pale and the hands began to shake. The trembling said: "Lecha! I... I have not betrayed you! Really! I am still yours, you Can... can check..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard looked up unexpectedly and glanced at Cocoa and said, "So, it is not a complete betrayal. When I am leaving, I intend to leave enough opportunities for you. If you really know how to abide by your obligations, you should not meet him privately. In this case, maybe I will see your contribution and sincerity. On, I will give you freedom again. But unfortunately, you didn't let me see the quality I hoped from you. On this floating island, there are eyes everywhere, ears everywhere, you can't do anything. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry for..." Cocoa lowered his head and said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Wasting time is a waste of grace. Now, it’s time to end!" Richard stopped and threw the dagger in El In front of the text, I said coldly: "Your crime will be said later, but first of all, I am tired of you and cocoa and relationship. If you want your family to be alive, pick up this sword and cut the following things yourself. It’s dirty!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa is also an exclamation, but under Richard’s sword-like look, I have to put the following words Swallowed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards who stepped on Irvine loosened their feet. Elvin was pale and slowly got up and picked up the shorts. He stared at Richard and asked, "Is it done according to what you said, my family will not have anything? Can I live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said: "Which is so cheap? I will turn your family into slaves on the charge of rebellion, but not mine slaves and prostitutes. They will live the life of ordinary slaves, tired and hard, but just work hard. You can maintain your life. And you need to fight for me. Every war, you have to rush to the front, retreat to the end, the most dangerous and difficult task, I will be the first to send you! As long as your desperately makes me satisfied, I will make your family feel a little more comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvin silently nodded, biting his teeth, turning his back and starting to undress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! Turn around, in front of everyone! And you, cocoa, look up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irvine’s hand is shaking and his body is shaking. He thought he was poisonous enough, but when it was over, it was really difficult to start. In his heart, two thoughts continue to struggle, one is to pounce on cocoa, a sword stabbed this woman who let himself faint. And Coco just wanted to let Richard check! Another idea is to do what Richard said, at least to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the second idea took the upper hand and the short sword fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
