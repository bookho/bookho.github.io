			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear melt burst disappeared in the depths of the passage, and the next moment, Richard stepped on the foot The hull suddenly slammed outward, and a flaming pillar was ejected from the gap, straight to hundreds of meters high. Under the violent power, the battleship shook sharply and the hull teared open a huge gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha jīng is shocked, in the closed space, the power of nuclear bursting has doubled, and the impact of its explosion is more than the high temperature Effective, Richard instantly calculated it based on the existing data, and found that the ship was torn apart from the three or four nuclear bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nuclear fire bursts were thrown into the depths of the hull, and after the continuous and violent shock, the reaper’s battleship finally could not bear this. The heavy blow, in the continuous roar, broke into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of a sparse cheer on the battlefield, and Richard focused on the battle with this huge ship, and the soldiers he had left were now very heavy casualties. Every Archimonde has killed dozens of enemies, but the problem is that there are too many reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just breathed a sigh of relief and is ready to support the fighting in other areas, but he is just about to leave, suddenly a large, high-energy beam on the side, moment Booming on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing roared, flashing a hundred meters, forcibly detached from the high-energy beam, but only a blow, blasted one-tenth of Richard Magic, such a powerful attack, comes from the main gun of the battleship. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warship was intercepted by Richard, but both sections were floating in the air, and they were all fighting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main gun of the battleship and some high-energy beams continue to bombard Richard, most of the sub-cannons are sweeping the ground, even if it is a 16th-level dark night, also There were several bombardments of the warship's auxiliary guns, and on this warship, the auxiliary guns had exceeded a thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard has sunk, and he appears again on the surface of the battleship with a teleport. First, he smashes the main gun of the battleship with a sword and then begins. The sub-cannons on the surface of the battleship were cleaned up one by one, and occasionally a nuclear burst was thrown into the depths of the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface of the battleship, Richard's figure flashed, and the place where it went would stir up layers of roar, and the sub-cannons within a few tens of meters were swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very clumsy and laborious method, but it is also the only way to destroy this warship. If you let it continue to attack, then it will take less than half an hour. All the people on the position will be killed by it. Except for Richard and the faceless, even the legendary strong will be seriously injured by its main shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten minutes, Richard finally cut the entire surface of the battleship. Now the ship has completely turned into a pitted metal pillar. There is no ability to attack, but even so, it is still floating in the sky, never falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has dozens of large and small wounds on his body. Throughout the process, he has to set fire with dozens or even hundreds of high-energy beams. Go to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard didn’t even have time to heal the wounds. He moved a few moments and rushed into a group of medium-sized fighters, using the power of the King of Metals to make them The maneuver was delayed for a moment, then the holy sword waved and destroyed all the medium-sized fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These medium-sized fighters are about to gather a small group of dark nights under the fire. If they let them successfully pour firepower, Druid’s protective cover is very It may be blasted, and then, Richard has also knocked down ten medium-sized fighters that are besieging the knights, and then, a group of medium-sized fighters besieging two sacred strongs<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the battle seems to never end. On the battlefield, there are all parts of the rescue that need to be rescued. There are soldiers everywhere who are in a precarious situation and are likely to fall at any time. Looking at the current level of wisdom talent, there is no way to judge priorities, but instinctively rush to the nearest and fastest goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds on his body are more and more, the burning feelings are all over the body, and even the consciousness of Richard is beginning to become groggy, and most of the attacks he has suffered From warships, as well as large and medium-sized fighters, their attacks are accompanied by terrible toxicities, and they accumulate much. Even Richard’s strong constitution is difficult to recover on his own, and his combat power is slowly declining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, he was completely instincted in dodge, in battle, in the rush, do not know how many reaper fighters and marine units were destroyed in the hands of Richard, I don't know how many reapers have hurt Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into the air, the sky, the earth, and the fighters and warriors of the reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war seems to never end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been unable to move the holy sword. This two-meter-long swordsman is unparalleled in dealing with the big man like the Reaper. Advantage, but every wave of it needs to use the power of Midarun, which is a heavy burden for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don’t know when Richard has thrown the sword on the battlefield, and pulls out the moonlight to continue the battle. As for the ruling, it hates the ability to kill and kills the soul. The power of this has no advantage in dealing with the icy machinery of the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Richard felt that the medium-sized fighter was not so good to find. Many times he had to find a group of small fighters to make a transition. Later, It seems that there are not many small fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard swept a knife and knocked five miniature fighters into a pile of burning parts at the same time, he suddenly found that there were no enemies around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Richard only reacted from the stun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hardly believe that the battle ended like this, but when I look at it, the whole earth is already full of viscera, within tens of thousands of meters, everywhere The darkened land, the accumulated bodies, and the wreckage of the reapers are still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, there are more than a dozen people floating in the air, that is the surviving strong, but on the land, but not much A figure that can stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, one after another climbed out of the ruins and struggled to stand up, which added a little anger to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still unbelievable that Richard’s battlefield adds up to nearly 100,000 troops, leaving only a few people who can stand, There are only two thousand people, except for the knights, the rest are the arms of the two mothers, and there are not many living creatures of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sensed the No. 2 position, where there was no response except for the individual strong. The No. 2 position was the first to be broken. Then the Reaper army rushed to the No. 1 position, and the two reapers joined forces. At the scene, so the battle is extraordinarily hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a somewhat blurred vision at the moment, his thinking has become very slow, and his accumulated toxicities have reached an alarming level, and now all begin to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his body, the heart of the big lord begins to pulsate, sending powerful energy to all parts of the body, fighting with poisonous dying, if not The energy supply of the heart of the big lord is endless. Only by the original three hearts, Richard has been poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the news came from the Cold Iron Throne and the Blue Water Oasis City. The specific content of Richard has been inaudible, but it is a good thing to have a message. Explain that they also won there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard became more and more vague, and suddenly he planted it on the ground, and in the confusion, Richard felt as if he had a hand to catch himself. At this moment, he had an inexplicable familiar feeling, but now he has no time to think about where this familiar feeling comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard’s consciousness fell into deep darkness, in the darkness, as if there were countless people who kept talking in Richard’s ear, noisy He is very irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Richard suddenly thought of a very important thing, and the reapers of those reapers were not refining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted and suddenly sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dimly lit room, the furnishings are very simple, there is no extra decoration, there is a girl in the corner of the room, it is the water, she She wrapped her blanket and slept with her sword. She was so tired that she couldn't wake her up with a loud scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed down from the bed, the cold sweat had drenched his clothes, it was wet and cold, he moved a little bit of magic and dried his clothes. I walked to the table with a light hand and took the magic clock and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still good, Richard only woke up for a day and woke up, but at this moment he was still sore and sore, and there was a strange feeling of emptiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
