			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a strange armor with a sword streak And traces of repairs. There are also large pieces of dark purple traces that have been corroded. According to Richard, only some powerful creatures such as the big devil will cause such effects. Only from this costume, we can see that she did not know how many battles she had experienced, and she was completely a horror from the sea of ​​blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young, beautiful woman, the whole body can not feel a trace of vitality, and some are murderous and dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, stood a tall, bald man, wrapped in a cloak, showing only a shiny bald head. He has a bronzed, radiant skin, and even his legs are wrapped around his muscles. He was also expressionless, his lips almost straight down, his eyes staring coldly at Richard. The man's pupil is an almond-shaped erect like a beast, and the depth of the pupil is dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of vindictiveness and has reached the 19th level. But standing at the woman's side, it is almost invisible. It’s not that he is not strong enough, but it’s the short-haired woman who is too sturdy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood there as if she had taken the light of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked in front of Richard and stood. The woman seemed to be able to sit still and was surprised to see her gaze, so the arrogant eyes softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door of the study suddenly opened and Faschi rushed in. She danced long and violently, and she held a short sword in her hands. As soon as she rushed into the study, she shouted: "Richard! You are okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi’s cry stopped, because the woman already Turning her head, her eyes fell on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Night!" Faschi exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman named White Night is slightly wrinkled, and it is obviously not clear who is Faschi. But the bald-headed man around him immediately leaned forward and said to her respectfully: "Faschi, a 19th-level sword dancer, is a personal assistant of Earl of Alice, Archimonde."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"19...The level is still right." White night said. This is the first time she spoke, and the voice also contained the meaning of killing and slaughtering, like the singer of countless swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s face passed a touch of blush, and the white night’s words were extremely arrogant and rude. The level is still right, isn't it just saying that her actual combat power is not good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she forced the huge humiliation that rushed in the moment, and did not act rashly, but took a step back. In a flash, Faschi remembered many legends about the white night. White nights are never arrogant or rude, she only tells the truth. Because in her opinion, there is no need to lie and deceive to achieve the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Faschi also remembered the identity of the white night. If you want to kill Richard in the white night, it is the two Faschi that can't stop it. Don't say white night, it is the bald man around her, and Faschi is not his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the recognition of the white night, Faschi naturally knows the identity of the bald man. Fire Dragon Grand Warlock Consica Orfidi, 19th level, has the same level of combat power as White Night. His combat power comes from the real form. Just like his professional name, Consica Orfidi is not a human being, but a fire dragon. A dragon that has been able to perform deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the ordinary people, the white night is silent, but in a certain circle, such as the strong people above the sanctuary, the reputation of the white night is widely circulated. Therefore, Richard did not know who the white night was, and Fasqi understood that he also realized that the two men did not want to see Richard's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Fasqi’s retreat, she stopped paying attention to her in the night, but went to Richard and said, “Agamemnon recommended to me. "You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agamemnon? Then you are..." When he heard the familiar name, Richard relaxed. At least know that the other party will not be completely malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is White Night, the sister who has no interest in the little guy." White night said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha unconsciously frowned, not because of the content of the white night, but every time she said a word, murderous will spit out, like a needle On Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in addition, Richard is no longer affected by others. In Faro, being chased by Sharon Will and fighting with Sinclair, it was a bloody career, and Richard had already honed a hard heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "Is useless little guy? How do I remember that Neris said that most people can't beat him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not an ordinary person." The white night's answer was straightforward and there was no modification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a smile and said seriously: "Well, no kidding. I don't know what Agamemnon recommended me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white night stood tall, and the height of nearly one meter nine allowed her to look down on Richard. Her light-colored eyes turned, and the Fire Dragon Warlock took a drawing from her arms and handed it to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put it." White night said in a commanding tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened it, it turned out to be a complete assembly drawing, which means that all the elements that make up the structure are marked, as long as the builder Levels and talents are enough to draw as you like. Richard was taken aback. In addition to the standard structure, the special structure that represents the creativity and inspiration of the various builders is almost without drawings. The general access is only inherited and exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has fixed his mind and looked at it carefully. This frame is attached to the arms, and the effect is to extract the vitality of the subject, which greatly increases the attack speed, and there is a small chance to attack the additional 'tearing' 'blood' 'necrosis' 'blood burst' and other effects . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can almost imagine that once this effect is launched, the enemies on the opposite side will flesh and blood!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is so fierce, there is also a name that matches the special effect, "Life is absolutely ruined." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it for ten minutes before he grew a sigh of relief, looked up and looked straight into the eyes of the white night, faintly asked: "This is the third-order structure. Pack, why come to me? Luno is a big builder, you should find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night said with a lifeless voice: "He can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also..." Richard thought about it and swallowed the words that had already come to his lips. Don't let the eyes look at the white night's eyes. Looking at the night with the white night, every second is suffering, but Richard is not afraid: "What good is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some fluctuations in the depths of the night in the night, and Shen Sheng said: "One day, if you set foot on the battlefield, I will keep you from dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, but you have to wait." Richard said simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very patient." After that, the white night took the Fire Dragon Warlock and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She disappeared when she left the door. Richard knew that she was leaving the window of the corridor, but did not know how to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the white night went for a long time, Faschi took a sigh of relief, then looked at Richard, and really admired and said: "You can actually make fun of her. It’s really admirable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking about the white night just now and asked: “Where is the battlefield?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a plane, a plane dedicated to war. In that plane, we have to fight with enemies from other planes. The battlefield is only The place of the strong. The people who can come out from there are mad." The tone of Faschi’s speech still has a faint ember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that similar to the plane war?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi immediately said: "No, not the same! On the battlefield, the enemies encountered are also from the main plane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again opened the drawing of 'Life is extinct'. From this structure, he saw the endless bloody hurricane and the destruction of countless lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress has a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three months, the time lighthouse of the Blue Water Oasis lights up again. When Richard walks out of the plane, the first thing is deep. Take a breath of hot air. This is the unique taste of the blood-stained land. It smells again and it is really fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been fighting on this land for nearly a year, from nothing to a foundation that has begun to take shape, Richard has already had a deep understanding of this land. feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are finally back!" The voice of the mother's nest first rang in the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of discomfort for Richard’s words at the mother’s nest. Later, I remembered that although it was only a few days in Noland, the Faro plane was already near. Three months have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, how, what's the matter?" Richard responded in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to swept the blood-stained land!" The mother's nest issued a declaration of murderous battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... seems to be a little early." Richard never thought that the mother's nest would say this. It is no longer like a summoner. In fact, from the time of hatching, the mother's nest is just one year old, but now the feeling of Richard, its wisdom is no less than anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not early! I need more food, and I have been staying in the fifth stage for too long!" The mother's nest conveyed a clear and strong desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
