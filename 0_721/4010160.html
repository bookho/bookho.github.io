Is this the result of letting them develop their personality? He sighed in his heart and quickly flipped through the information transmitted by his mother's nest, and asked: "Is the blood of the Holy Spirit not only having anything to do with flying?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have already indicated in the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too much information in the nest, and Richard has looked through the whole Five minutes later, I found a piece related to the blood of the Holy Spirit. Now the upper limit of the divine storage of the mother's nest is raised from fifty to seventy, which is the first benefit of the blood of the Holy Spirit. The more devotion the mother's nest stores, the stronger the power of its body. But the blood of the Holy Spirit is very powerful, and the analysis takes a few months. So far, the mother's nest is only one-fifth of the resolution. This is the blood left by Zuka when he was still alive, and how many times he was purer than the blood of the unicorn that was faintly seen by the Viscount of Hem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the parsing section, Richard suddenly saw the contents of the unicorn blood. It turns out that the blood of the unicorn of Himself is a sacred unicorn, but it is actually incomplete. After the mother's nest is parsed, the part of the broken part is filled with divinity, and the holy unicorn of Richard is the one. But even so, with regard to the blood power, Richard's mount is far from the true sacred unicorn. However, the mother's nest mentioned that after waiting for the blood of more unicorns in the future, and even capturing the true sacred unicorn, it can analyze and develop the blood of the unicorn more fully. The more samples you have, the stronger your blood will develop. In the end, the unicorn created by the mother's nest will be even stronger than the real unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in addition to bringing a sacred unicorn to Richard, the unicorn blood can also add anti-magic attributes to the combat unit, allowing them to receive Reduces all spell damage by 20%. Of course, the more various attributes are attached, the more expensive the manufacturing costs are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s sacred unicorn has the potential to continue to upgrade because it consumes as much as 30 points of divinity. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after getting the latest batch of supplements, the mother's nest has stored 30 units of divinity, which is enough for promotion to the seventh order. However, it has not been promoted to the sixth stage for a long time. It has not evolved completely in this stage. It will take at least a few months to stabilize, plus five hundred magic crystals to re-advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard is relieved. Five hundred magic crystals, equivalent to 200,000 gold coins, was an astronomical figure for him a few months ago, but now it is not a burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected harvest is the fifty human-shaped knights guarding the mother's nest, which gained additional evolutionary potential because they swallowed the nest of the mother's nest. These fighters will evolve with battle and killing and will eventually be promoted to level 14. Richard immediately decided to equip them with weapons made from forged black Yao iron. Better equipment means more chances of survival, and the potential is only alive to become a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dealing with the affairs of the hen's nest, Richard let the hens continue to wander in the turbulent land, while foraging, creating more humanoid knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Faro was quiet for a while, and three months passed without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night after three months, Richard is deeply meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His consciousness struggled hard in the void, chasing a blue band of light ahead. This is the fourth-order form of the star, and in the past three months, Richard has only seen it for the second time. The first capture failed without suspense. As for the fifth-order illusion star, it only happened once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the light belt seems to have no trajectory to follow, but Richard's wisdom and real talent simulate a set of formulas for its forward movement. However, it requires a huge amount of calculations, and it is difficult for Richard Wisdom talent to bear such a huge calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, the blue light flashed a bit and disappeared. Li sighed and let go of his disappointment and began to calculate a purple third-order starburst that was not far away. This is also a good thing, it will appear once in a day or two. Originally, Richard would never let go, but suddenly there was a fourth-order star band, and Richard only let go of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a intense chase, Richard finally captured the third-order starburst and pulled it into his body. Throughout the meditation process, not only does the magic power grow, but Richard discovers that his spiritual strength and computing power are also tempered and slowly progressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inheritance, the Dark Blue series of meditation is much more efficient than the average magician's meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard once again captured a second-order starburst, the whole body suddenly shocked, and the magic level slowly overflowed a certain watershed. Richard knows that he is already thirteen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen levels means that you can cast seven levels of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the seventh level, each level of magic is a big or small watershed. The power of attack magic is getting bigger and bigger, almost increasing in geometric progression, and more and more optional tactics. It is no longer uncommon for a magic to reverse the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seven levels of magic, there is a possibility of causing a death-death death, the soul rebukes such spells, there are also phase gates that can transmit in short distances, and The summoning technique that summons life to cause great damage can reflect the spell reversal of the low-level magic attack, etc., and the powerful lightning storm, bursting fireball, iridescent jet, and finally, the sword of green flame and darkness in the seven magics. The weapon formed by the sword and other magic, the power is still above the fine weapon. However, compared with the deified weapon of the same level, the magic weapon is a whole grade regardless of its power, range and duration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current increase in magic is four to five times faster than the average mage. The original dark blue meditation efficiency is only double that of ordinary meditation, but Richard is in wisdom. With the help of two talents, the ability to capture the stars is far above the mage who practiced the deep blue meditation, and the enhancement of the blood of the elf magic star, so that the level of such metamorphosis is achieved. As the level of Richard and the ability of blood vessels increase, higher-order starbursts will appear more and more, and the speed of cultivation will be faster and faster. This is the source of Richard’s confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already at the thirteenth level, Richard is not prepared to continue to meditate, but to activities and calm down the excitement. He walked out of the meditation room and walked to the magic lab. On the workbench, a new architectural design is nearing completion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, both the state of mind and the power of the soul have improved. When you see this structure, the inspiration is instantly surging, and several final fine links Difficulties, being overcome one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the front of the frame design, Richard is happy and very satisfied with his work. In several places to solve the final details, Richard has already solved the problem with ultra-high-precision drawing. In the space where the big builder can only draw four lines, Richard actually draws six lines! This structure, even if the design is published, there is no way to copy it. Because accuracy can be said to be the unique advantage of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
