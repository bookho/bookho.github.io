			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron’s gaze suddenly fell to the ground on a pile of rocks, and then smashed Going down and observing it carefully, this pile of stones looks no different from other rock piles in the wilderness, but in fact it is a way for Dakso Das to pass information, through the position of the stones, corresponding A series of numbers that can convey extremely complex information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior Warrior carefully distinguished the information, but suddenly there was a soft voice coming from around: "What is written in this pile of stones."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand, but the Warrior Warrior knows that it is Nolan German, but turned around, but saw a young Nolander standing just a few meters away from him. The place is also staring at the pile of stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior immediately clenched the weapon, but did not immediately attack. The young man was weak in his eyes and dressed in a very common mage robe. I didn't even feel any magical fluctuations. It was just an ordinary robes. According to the common sense of the warriors, the heavy gun in his hand waved, so that the guy could kill ten or eight. However, his intuition was strong. Screaming, reminding him of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary Nolander, how can he come to such a close distance without being noticed, he can stand here and be able to The weapon will be detected when it is inserted into the body of the Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of the warrior, Richard realized his mistake, not all Dax Sodas know Nolan, so he tears After opening a small scroll and blessing a special language for himself, he asked: "What is written in this pile of stones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior immediately roared Road: "This is the secret of our Dakso Das people, it is impossible to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed: "I am sorry, I originally thought Let go of you, in addition, you wasted my scroll, this scroll is very expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior warriors say nothing, suddenly a heavy gun狠狠 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李 李This gun is equivalent to using their natural ability to strike with weapons, more hidden and quick, there have been several Noland strong Under this move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dazzling electro-optic light on Li, and a snake-like arc appeared everywhere. There were even a few electric balls flying around him. At this moment, the momentum of Richard completely changed. He pulled out the barbaric slaughter and greeted the people. The soldiers' heavy guns, the swords and guns intersected, and the Richards were shocked. The whole body was shocked and snorted. There was blood flowing down the corners of the mouth. However, the full-strength of the horse-man warriors who surpassed the foothills was actually caught by Richard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei revealed a satisfactory smile, and used the force to open the heavy guns of the Warrior, and then stared at the horror to the horror of the horse warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Encore people are born with great strength. This young horse warrior is also an outstanding generation of the family. This attack is equivalent to the saint warrior who specializes in strengthening the human race. Although Richard is extremely difficult to stop, and at most two or three defenses will collapse, but he still blocked the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed his hand at the Warrior Warrior and said, "Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the effect of the advanced language scroll is not available, the Warrior can also understand the provocative gesture of the full-faced general. Although the blow was just held by Richard, the Warrior has already noticed that Richard’s power is still inferior to himself. A few more times, Richard must be unable to eat, it seems that this is a sly man, originally a warrior, but it is necessary to wear a magician's skin to lead him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha greeted the knife again, but this time it was no longer hard, but the pressure of the belt, the horseman’s heavy gun lost direction, heavy When he broke into the ground, Richard did not attack the situation. Instead, he took a few steps back and opened the distance. However, under the eyes of the warrior, he was able to bless himself with various state magic, and he was quick and powerful. , magic shield, alert response... seven or eight magics in a row, seeing the people and soldiers stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back." Richard again hooked his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior screamed and rushed, heavy guns, like squally showers, went to Richard, stabbed, even the shock of the talent ability was used. However, Richard was able to move forward and retreat in the air, and the electric light in the whole body was unsettled. The brutal slaughter in his hands seduce and seduce all the attacks one by one. The Warrior Warrior only felt that all the attacks were not realized, and the power of the whole body was fundamental. I can't use it. It's really awkward. In the past battles, he has also encountered strong people who are skilled in the art, but there is no such thing as Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of storms did not have the slightest effect. The Warrior had to jump out of the battle circle and stare at Richard. He kept breathing heavily, sweating all over the body, wetting long hair, only a few minutes of attack. It consumes his little half of the vindictiveness, but the opposite Richard is a good one, not tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not attack immediately, but waited for a few minutes, waiting for the horse soldier to breathe a little evenly, and then hooked his finger and said: "Re Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior roared and rushed to the gun. Before the fierce battle, he suddenly felt like a fool. The result of the battle verified the Warrior’s The idea, Richard has solved all his attacks with incomparable combat skills. At this time, the Warrior Warrior is stupid and understands. The art of Richard's battle is terrible. Now it is obviously taking him to hone something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the red eyes, staring at Richard, constantly squirting out the nostrils, when Richard checked his fingers again. The horse warrior roared with an earth-shattering, then turned and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, he immediately laughed and chased it. The Encore people are a race known for their speed. But when they talk about long-distance pursuits, they are not human. The magician's opponent, and Richard, the magician who is armed with magic, is the speed of short-distance sprint far beyond him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has once again squirted a large piece of electric fire, pulling out the residual image of the film, like a meteor, chasing after the desperate horseman, behind Li, The piece of electric fire fell on the ground, turned into a myriad of electro-optic spiders, crawling around, and then gradually disappeared after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Richard has been running alongside the Warriors, and the Warriors are angered and suddenly stopped, shooting a shot at Richard. This shot is destined to have no results. Richard took a step, and the long knife stabbed and received only a residual image in the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy gun of the Warrior Warrior only pierced the afterimage of Richard, he suddenly stiffened in place, slowly bowed his head and looked at his body side, where the weight A has been cut open, revealing a wound that is more than one meter long. The wound is very shallow, less than an inch deep. This makes the horse warrior feel a little relieved, but his heart jumps faster and faster, instinctively feels big. The difficulty has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, not deep wound suddenly rips on its own, the flesh and blood are all bursting, the blood spray is like a red rain, a huge The heart fell to the ground and rolled to the front of the Warrior. It was still pulsating strongly. The Warrior stared at it for a few seconds before suddenly thinking that it was his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood far more than ten meters away, watching the men and horses slowly fall down, secretly sighed, this is a good opponent, let Richard have more experience in the use of magical armed forces, improved magical armed When the output power is too fierce, it is somewhat difficult to control. Richard’s already mature and sophisticated combat skills should be re-trained to fit this new structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard went to the sun and the moon, and it wasn’t long before a magical man with a long chain of chains appeared in Richard’s field of vision. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the fierce, slowly approaching the demon, Richard reached out and hooked his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, when Richard stepped into the capital of the day in a few days, he carried a small parcel behind him, compared with when he left. The day has not recovered, but it is completely incomparable with the heyday of the year. In the last war, the losers were too heavy, which caused many people to be strongly dissatisfied with Marshal Lundstedt. Indignantly left the Legion Fortress, although there are many strong people coming, but the number is not even half of the day, the Marshal is still in the League of Justice for trial, which is destined to be a protracted lawsuit, has been tried It has been a long time and is destined to continue for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now three legendary towns in the capital of the day to ensure that the fortress is not lost. One of the legends is from the Millennium Empire, dedicated to assisting the sacred Hastings is still in the league's defensive day, but it is clear that Richard has no interest in meeting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence’s shop is still the same, the inside is cold and clear, and there is no guest. In fact, since Richard knew the old man, I didn't see any customers in his shop who had visited it. Some people didn't use it. There was nothing in his store that could be sold. Most of the people who came here were seriously injured and wanted to ask him to heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the store, he heard the familiar buzz, and the old man still fell asleep behind the counter, even in his sleep, he also Showing a wretched smile, apparently not doing a good dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked close to Lawrence’s ear and shouted: "Old man, wake up, I am coming to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp Lawrence suddenly fell to the ground and shouted: "Who is here, baby, is your husband coming back, hell, let me go to the closet to hide."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
