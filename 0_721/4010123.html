			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard really laughed and sighed and said, "Yes. You can't die, but you will be scared to death! The children of this big aristocrat, do you think they are very scared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the owner also be a big aristocrat?" Br?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Of course I don’t count, I grew up in a small mountain village." Richard’s voice had a hint of vagueness, apparently remembering his childhood. However, he did not notice that the success was turned off by the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is a bit surprised that Twilight can command elite bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly found out that an elite bat was flying fast and flew at full speed to the turbulent land. This is unusual. Without his command, how can the elite bat suddenly leave? Look at its route, like returning to the nest. Richard made several orders to the bat in succession, but the elite bat did not respond at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat unit will lose control? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is very gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, what's going on, why is there an elite bat that doesn't listen to orders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a moment, the consciousness of the mother's nest was connected with Richard, and then said: "This is a defective product, I have found its problem, so forced to summon the return, in order to recycle After re-creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao feels that things are not so simple, this bat seems to be the bat that bite Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the next sentence of the mother's nest immediately puts Richard in doubt: "Master, I have completed evolution, and now it is sixth." Now, you need to decide on the new evolutionary direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the mother's nest has been successfully promoted to the sixth stage, Richard's consciousness is immediately transmitted by the mother's nest. The message is filled. In fact, after the sixth-grade promotion, the ability of the mother's nest to increase is not much more than the fifth level. The main evolutionary options are the original ones. The most special is that the mother nest can also have an independent second consciousness. In addition, in the choice of the creation of the arms, there are more options for riding. There are many choices for the ride, not only the common creatures such as the lion, tiger, wolf and horse, but also the special form of the ant spider. And in the top of the top ride, there are actually more options for the lion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the mother’s nest can only create ten creatures at the highest level. All the lions are also young, almost the same size as ordinary lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same amount of content, the level of detail of the message is ten times more than in the past. So that Richard has an illusion, is the mother's nest also depends on the number of words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the lion was strong, after Richard saw the relevant instructions, he immediately vetoed this item. The cost of the lion is too high, and the price/performance ratio is surprisingly poor. Every two days, the mother's nest can make a lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has repeatedly tested a variety of combinations, and finally determined the humanoid knight, with the horse form of the knight. Under this scheme, the mother's nest can create three knights a day, with a comprehensive strength of ten. If you match the enchantment equipment that Richard brought back from Noland, you can single out the eleventh-level knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after receiving the plan selected by Richard, the mother's nest immediately replied: "Master, I have a better plan, you should consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After receiving the proposal from the mother's nest, Richard suddenly laughed and laughed. That is not an original scheme at all, it is simply a centaur! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularity of the Centaur program is indeed very high, and the maternal nest can create four heads and a half people on a premise that the strength does not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, how do you think of creating a centaur?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in turmoil In the depths of the land, a centaur tribe was found, all of which was destroyed by me, and then the centaur plan was resolved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pondered for a moment, said "No, it was created according to the original plan. It is difficult for the centaur to integrate into the human kingdom. I don't want to explain it to the nobles or the priests. It is already very troublesome to throw the soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered something and asked: "The mother's nest, is it that you have swallowed any race? What kind of race can you create?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all, it depends on the difficulty of the analysis. In fact, I can only parse a small number of races now. The more The harder it is to resolve higher races."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accordance with my plan, the full transformation of the humanoid knight. In addition, regarding your ontological evolution, you can use the remaining gods. Sex Of a second consciousness. "Richard quickly set the sixth-order evolutionary scheme of the hive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is finally six steps! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that every month, Richard will receive nearly 100 powerful fighters who are equivalent to the Cavaliers. Now, time is completely on the side of Richard. However, in excitement, Richard forgot the out-of-control elite bat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just half a day, the elite bat flew to the turbulent land, hovering around, and looking for a direction, swooping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a clearing of the forest, the mother's nest is lying on the ground, the abdomen stretches and shrinks, and the thick acid mist is continuously ejected from the ventral respiratory hole. Its body shape has not become larger, but it has shrunk slightly. The insects are darker, but they are faintly transparent. From the depths of the insects, you can see that the faint light golden brilliance is flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite bat swooped down from the sky, hovering in front of the nest, then opened his mouth and dripped a little from two long, hollow, blood-sucking teeth. Blood. As soon as the blood left the blood-sucking teeth, it was pulled by an invisible force and floated into the mouthparts of the mother's nest. After the elite bat spit out the blood, he planted it on the ground and twitched it a few times before he moved again. The breathing rhythm of the mother's nest was significantly accelerated, and dozens of compound eyes were unclear, apparently analyzing what was at full speed. Moreover, it is full of vitality, and this analysis is actually driven by the absorbed divinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day and one night, the twinkling of the hen’s complex eyes stopped, and it suddenly flashed a seven-color brilliance, suddenly and faintly, and then dimmed after an integer number of hours. Go on. At this time, the mother's nest struggled to prop up the huge body, slowly climbed a few steps to the front, and then fell to the ground, appearing weak. Behind the mother's nest, leave a white follicle that is twice as large as a normal egg. After a while, the egg shell broke, and a silver-white pony was drilled from inside! This silver pony is very incomparable, and even more surprising is the fact that there is a milky white horn on the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pony screamed, and after a few laps in place, he jumped up and rushed to the direction of the blood-stained land, and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Richard just finished a dress, stretched out and looked out the window, seeing the sky, I don’t smile. A hard night, but there are gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a clear horsehair suddenly sounded in the courtyard, and the voice contained a force that penetrated the magical power, which made Richard’s heart tight. He rushed to the window and looked down. He saw a silver-haired horse in the courtyard, which seemed to be the ultimate. However, Richard's gaze immediately fell on the silver horn of the silver horse's forehead, and lost his voice: "Unicorn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nest is in Richard In the consciousness: "Master, I created a special unit with extra divinity. But this time there is no other choice, only this form. This is a holy unicorn, although in its infancy, it can be constantly Grow. But its blood is not very pure, so the talent is far from the true sacred unicorn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really a unicorn ?" Richard is still in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a move and asked coldly: " Where did you get the unicorn blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The birth of any special unit is irregular, master. Why the orc's divinity will condense Out of a unicorn, I can't figure it out, I can only say that this is God's will." The mother's nest will put the responsibility in a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and no longer struggled with the matter. In any case, being able to have a legendary unicorn as a mount is a complete bonus. The two characteristics of the unicorn's demon and magic increase make them the best mounts for the magician. Only the various planes, the unicorns are few and far between, and the number is not even comparable to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Richard had a unicorn as a mount, and it spread throughout the Blue Water Oasis City. This is the legendary beast, but it has become the mount of Richard. People who know it are incredible. But it is not surprising to think of the legendary mage behind Richard and the mysterious new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when the Viscount sees this unicorn, his face is wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganization of the army is still in progress, a team of mysterious people entered the Oasis City. That night, in the residence of Richard, the Duke of the Wolf appeared with Palin. The duke hand-held a magic box, and then slowly opened in front of Richard and the sand surface. Inside the magic box, it is actually a small black jade bust, and the whole body flows with faint brilliance. In the moment when the magic box opened, Richard seemed to hear a roar of anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the ancestor statue of the Count of Juno. The ancestor of Count Juno was once a legendary strongman. It has been more than a thousand years now. It is from this ancestor that the Juno family became a ancestor worship. I think this statue should meet the requirements of the quicksand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cang The Duke of the Wolf said very plainly, but Richard knew how powerful the family of the legendary strong had ever been. Even if it is only an earl, it is definitely the first class of strength. Seeing the entanglement of this ancestor statue, part of the soul of Juno's ancestors must be inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and Richard looked at each other and said, "This statue is enough to hold a sacrifice, and it should be able to obtain the eternal and timeless dragon. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
