			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need to run for yourself, use the magic newsletter to say If you can't say it, those old guys, hey, now you can use it, you are all selfish, I hope that your research project can be seen by you, so you can get your support." Heijin does not hesitate Old friends who have been selling for many years, in his view, Richard directly funded these big magician and the big alchemists, and did not help much to improve the financial situation of Deep Blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the research on rock-fired combustion improver?" Richard went to the dark blue with Black Gold and asked about the project he was most concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two more weeks, no way, the old elf stinks again, and he looks at a young elf beauty, now It takes a few hours every day to write a love poem for her, and there is not much thought in research.” Black Gold said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf does not understand how a woman’s charm may compare with gold coins, why would someone put a lot of gold coins not to earn, but to please a A woman, no matter if the woman is an elf or a human being, even if she is a female dragon, as long as there is a gold coin, it is not how many heads there are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is the leading alchemist in the dark blue, and this project is only the most suitable for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and was very fond of the elf master, so he said: "I can study it in two weeks, Black Gold Master You can arrange it for me. I want to talk to all the masters alone. I have some doubts about the promotion of the big magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This arrangement is not very difficult. I can give you the old guys in the dark blue... Wait, what you just said, who is going to be promoted to the big magister, is it you?" To jump up, he kept turning around the circle around Richard, as if he was watching a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible, how old you are, this is going to become a big magician, isn’t it like me, of course, our grey dwarfs are not Known by magic, this is just my own little hobby, but Xiao Licha, you have twenty, actually you have to become a big magician, it’s a hell, let the old guy’s face put However, your potential in the past is only excellent, on the other hand, it is considered to be excellent, and soon... Oh, I have nothing to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Richard looked suspiciously at Black Gold. He could hear from the words of the Grey Dwarf. He must have concealed something, and it was related to his talent evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how much Richard asks, Black Gold has a look that is not willing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha will not let him go so easily, until he enters the Black Gold office, Richard is asking a question repeatedly, if you don’t answer, don’t Do the other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold panted and jumped on his desk, sat down on the knees, thought about it, and finally revealed some of the content related to the Richard Jindae Magister . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original dark blue qualification test of Richard, the comprehensive assessment is only excellent, plus the blood, it is only a little stronger than the excellent, there is no To reach the minimum standards of Su Hailun students, above the excellent, and genius, and then after the excellence, legend and only, standing on top of everything, is Su Hailun himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Richard, the worst evaluation of Su Hailun’s students was also a genius. The rest were excellent and even had a legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower the magical talent detected, the slower the speed is not only when the magic is raised, but also the ability to get powerful power when you are a great magister. But this is not absolute. After all, the experience of countless powerful people seems to prove that luck is the most important factor in the process of promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Noland, there are too many things that can only be resorted to luck, so in the native of Noland, the lucky god will become the most powerful. One of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole morning, Richard and Thirteen of the 17 Dark Magisters in Deep Blue had an in-depth exchange. In the following afternoon, Richard I locked myself in the library and flipped through the various magical classics until the serving apprentices sent the dinner in. Richard noticed that the whole afternoon had passed without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is placed in the tableware made of Lafite iron, which is the most familiar style of Richard, which makes him feel like he has returned to the past five In the days of the year, while eating dinner, Richard was as if he was in the dark blue school. For a time, his thoughts on Su Helun were unprecedentedly strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard hurriedly cleaned all the food in the dish and left the library to go to the exclusive area of ​​the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard successfully entered the legendary Master’s bedroom and saw Su Helun who was lying on the jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still so beautiful and beautiful, sleeping posture is a bit sultry, but it makes people feel that there is no indecent place, only feel The girl in front of her is very pure and lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard knows that the legendary mage is just like her appearance because of her special ethnicity. She is just an adult, even, perhaps far from the real There is still a short distance in adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Helun is not yet an adult, then her race is really terrible, even if the dragon does not need such a long time to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of the Yutai, sat down, and looked at Su Hailun’s face with certainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage’s golden hair was erected on the forehead, demonstrating to Richard, and then lazily swaying, even Richard The gesture of gently touching Su Hailun’s blond hair was turned a blind eye. After seeing it from the last time, Richard’s attitude towards Richard was much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special feature of bullying and shattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the sleeping Su Helun, Richard didn’t even know how to call her, teacher, or anything else, thinking of that passion and crazy One night that made him feel overwhelmed, Richard did not know how to face her, and thought of the joy of Su Hailun, which was not able to be measured by gold coins. The numbers listed in the items are like their subjects, meaning Her deep joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to be a big magician soon. Now I am only twenty years old, I have not lost your face..." Richard said that here, some say It won't go any longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened his hands together and became more and more forceful. He finally saw Su Hailun, and finally had some achievements worthy of pride, but now, In front of her, but somehow, it is very difficult to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Su Hailun, all the glory and glory are so bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t say it, Richard doesn’t say anything, but quietly flips through the memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the legendary Master’s racial and adult problems, Richard suddenly had a very strange idea, and that night would be a momentary impulse during her early adulthood. It may even be an impulsive impulse, just like a wayward girl, must get something that is loved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought of that night, I remembered the promise of that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled up Su Hailun’s hand and pulled the sleeves up, revealing a white and soft arm, but at that night Su Hailun's body is full of blue lines, and the same is true of the arms. The unspeakable beauty is like a sigh in the depths of the endless face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the legendary sixth-order structure ‘dark blue sigh’ is deeply hidden under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue sigh... Richard has not yet reached the realm of the Magister, and it is difficult to make a fourth-order construction. Deep blue sighs, I don't know how long it will take, and the secret of the deep blue sigh can only be found in other planes, and the strength of Richard's present is as bad as the distance of the unknown plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard sitting here is struggling with great contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve the strength, he needs to climb the threshold of the Magister as soon as possible, so that he can make a fourth-order structure, but on the other hand, the most powerful individual The consideration of the situation, but must try to suppress the realm under the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the conversations with the dark blue multi-magic mentors, as well as a large amount of relevant information, it shows that the ability and blood power to get the big magician is close. Relationships, in general, the more powerful the blood is, the stronger the ability can be, although not absolutely, but as long as it is mostly, it is worth adjusting the direction of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if Richard wants to tap his maximum potential, he needs to first develop the blood force to the extreme, and then step on the steps of the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
