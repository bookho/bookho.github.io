			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is stunned. He once saw a description of this phenomenon in Deep Blue. Generally, there are super strong people who use powerful skills that need to extract the source of the plane. At this time, the phenomenon that the whole plane trembles will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What superpower is fighting? Richard quickly flashed this thought, but people immediately became alert and fearful. He may not be afraid of ordinary The strong leader of Kesodas, but not arrogant, thinks that he can insert a foot in the battle of this super strong, even if it is affected by the aftermath of the battle, most of his life is not guaranteed, although he is not afraid of ordinary The sanctuary, but the beginning and the illusion made him realize that on the powerful road, there is still too much to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard suddenly found a black-grey pointer on the compass in front of the magical force, and suddenly turned black and turned gray. Richard was shocked. This small change meant a truly significant event: that is, a military fortress is in a fierce attack and defense, and it will change hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission Fortress, that is the supreme fortress that controls the surrounding area. Each of the regiment’s fortresses does not know how many strong people gather, the town, and the performance of the compass It seems that I don't know which Nolan's superpower entered the extremist battlefield and launched an attack on the Duke Sodas's regiment fortress, and it seems that he is about to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the direction of the fortress’s fortress, tens of thousands of kilometers away, and of course Richard could not see anything, but as a floating island of the Holy Alliance The wealthy, the information of the dusk land can be obtained unconditionally. Richard knows that the fortress of the army is called the rising sun, and is the first legion-level fortress established by the Holy Alliance on the battlefield. However, it follows Noland was gradually inferior in the dusk, and this fortress fell into the hands of the Daksodars several decades ago. This is the most shameful moment of Noland, especially the Holy Alliance in the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, it seems that the shame of the past is about to be washed away. I don’t know which one, or which superpowers are dispatched, have this brilliant record, for a time. Richard actually had a feeling of being famous and exuberant, but he was very clear that he was still in the stage of seeking survival in the twilight, and he was not involved in the war that only belonged to the superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Noland has achieved a brilliant victory, but Richard knows that the next time is the real hardship, Dakso Das People will not be willing to fail, and will launch a crazy counterattack. At that time, it will be the power of several fortresses to jointly attack the 'Rise of the Rising Sun'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard condensed and became more cautious, and continued to rush to the sun and the land. This time his luck was not good or bad. He even failed to meet a Dakso Das for several days. Let Richard have some regrets. Several rat meats hanging around the waist have already been laid, so Richard has been starving for the past two days. The meat of the mouse is not only extremely high in energy, but also has a slight improvement in physical fitness. Richard now began to regret that he was wasting so much mouse meat, and there was no life in the dusk, and it was almost impossible to find anything in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the cracked ground, Richard is running at a slower pace with the most energy-saving state, and covering himself with all the terrain, his hands are always holding The short knife of the barbaric slaughter will occasionally falter or slash a knife, then frown and shake his head and move on. For a few days, Richard does not know how many basic swaying and slashing exercises have been practiced. Practice has almost become instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard jumped over a shallow, wide crevice, he jumped a little higher, at this point the change suddenly occurred, a full The sharp barbed tentacles suddenly swayed from the sand and slammed into Richard! This attack was so sudden that even Richard could not detect that there was an enemy ambushing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a power, and the short knife immediately slammed into the tentacles, but the tentacles were so powerful that Richard’s full force only opened half of the tentacles, short knife Was taken away by the tentacle, and the tentacles of the tentacles were only slightly off. From the side of Richard's leg, Richard was sullen, and the blood was splashing in the air, but he volleyed through the impact. As far as ten meters away, Richard just landed, and immediately stared at the waving tentacle, slowly placed the knife on the ground, the knife touched the ground, and immediately put the three long knives inside. All popped up and inserted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle waved a few laps in the air, finally reached the position of Richard, screaming, and stabbed to Richard like lightning, Richard did not think, The backhand grabbed the long knife of the barbaric slaughter, and roared, the electric light was lingering in the body, and the arms were full of bloody colors. The barbaric massacre suddenly pulled out countless afterimages and greeted the tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嚓嚓嚓嚓, after all the close rubbing sounds, the front section of the tentacle was cut into dozens and fell to the ground, and the vitality of the tentacle was extremely tenacious. Each section is still on the ground, but the barbaric massacre is a quasi-legendary weapon, and the power is greatly increased under the dual driving of the magical armed forces and the life-stricken, and the whole first half of the tentacles is shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly there was a painful roar in the sand. An elephant-like monster rushed out from the ground. Four blood-red eyes stared at Richard, huge and almost one-third of the body’s mouth. , a screaming scream, a life that Richard has never seen before, looking like a gray fish, its head is unusually large, almost half of the body, that Zhang Jukou is also particularly scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a tentacle on top of it, it’s the murderer who sneaked into Richard and almost succeeded, but now, the tentacle has been cut in half. The size of the monster looks huge, but it is very small compared to the ten-meter-long tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of unprecedented opponents, Richard first had some mistakes, and then carefully began to retreat, refused to approach the opponent, encountered in the field battlefield Any enemy can be a sanctuary or even a legendary strongman. In the face of an unknown opponent, no matter how cautious it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster took the tentacles back, and stared at Richard, constantly threateningly roaring, but not willing to attack easily, apparently the tentacles were destroyed, It is also a minor injury to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like a beast and slowly lowers his body and becomes a half-squatting posture. In the calculation of the second consciousness, this is currently the most suitable. The fighting posture, although somewhat weird, can explode at the maximum speed in an instant. The injury on the thigh reminds Richard that the attack speed of this unknown monster is so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one beast are so squatting and moving slowly between each other, no one will take the lead in launching an attack. After a while, Richard’s eyes shine for the second time. The resolving power is restarted, but this time it only looks at the structure of the monster skin. This is a very strange animal. The skin is extremely thick, and the skin and the skin are all solid bones, so that Richard The analytical power is also inseparable from such a thick skin, seeing its internal structure, and there is no energy flowing in the monster's cortex and bones, just like ordinary beasts, so Richard can't predict its ability and attack. opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one beast are wounded, but the wound on Richard's thigh is already closed, and the ability of the Hydra lizard appears to be precious at this moment, Richard Suddenly remembered the trip to Calando, perhaps the Hydra camel that moved from the mountains and the sea was not casual. Maybe she was for the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
