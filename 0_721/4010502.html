The Snow Mountain Temple is built at an altitude of 10,000 meters. The harsh climate is that the strong barbarian warriors will be hard to resist. Jiklama is even more chilly. If you don’t go to the sanctuary or you are a strong and powerful person, you can’t stop on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker town is already very lively, full of young barbarian warriors who come to the Holy Scriptures, only a small part of them are eligible to participate in the battle for the Holy Scriptures Most people come to see the excitement. Most of the front of the battle for the Holy Scriptures will be held on the platform of the snow-sand half-waist. It is possible to see the battle of many powerful players. It is definitely a very useful experience for the young barbarian warriors. Therefore, many tribes are led by the elders, bringing young people with potential and promising futures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker town is not crowded with tens of thousands of people, most people are looking for an open space outside the town, tied up the tent overnight, In a barbarian costume, Richard was in the crowd and was immediately overwhelmed. He turned around in the town, bought a tent of the barbarians, and learned how everyone had spent the night in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard went to the snowy mountain with the brigade’s people. This road is quite long, and it takes a day to climb the platform at normal speed. At that time, Richard can of course fly directly, but it is too eye-catching, and it is not conducive to his adjustment of the mood at the moment, so he presses his mind and walks step by step, which is also a kind of war. Grinding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Temple is ready to build a large number of separate small camps on the platform. This is a campsite for those who participate in the Holy Scriptures. The barbarian can only camp on a farther place. In the corner of the platform, there is a tall totem pole. The bloody streamers are flying in the air. It is the place where the ceremonial battle is registered. The totem column has been lined up for a long time. The team, followed by the registration team slowly progressed, more than an hour passed, and finally finally arrived. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few warriors in the temple under the totem column looked at Richard, seemingly disdainful for his thin and weak body, a strong The samurai said: "What is your name, which tribe comes from, and who has the recommendation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard handed over a dark iron medal. The back of the iron card was a tyrannosaurus, and the front was engraved with the name and position of Cangyang Zhuoma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the holy temple warrior immediately became much more kind, saying: "It turned out to be the recommendation of Cangyang Zhuoma, your name."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"李察."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lee, the strange name, it is a bit like the Norand." The warrior said, but did not ask much, but used a knife to engrave the name of Richard on an iron plate, handed the iron card to Richard, and said: "The above is your entry number, tomorrow will call Come to your competition, don't make a mistake, take a rest tonight, don't mess around with the girl, huh, huh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the platform lit up a clump The sounds of the bonfire, the drums, the horns and the harpsichords are in harmony with each other. What is more outstanding is the singular and singular song of the barbarians. Young or old barbarians sing and dance around the bonfire, and Richard is also at the fire. Silently roasting the dried meat, tearing it away, thinking about things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians’ lyrics are mostly stories of struggles with hardships, many of which have heroes who have sacrificed their own way to eradicate the powerful World of Warcraft. Only for the tribal people to open up a new piece of living space, it is the heroes of generations to open up the territory by bloodshed, only to have the prosperity of the Karando tribe today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in these lyrics, Richard has heard many different things. The biggest problem in the Calando continent is poverty, which is caused by water shortage. The climate here is dry and rainless. Although there are few large deserts, most of them are grasslands and wilderness. If there is not enough food, it will be difficult to increase the population and food problems. Noland has already solved the problem through plane development. And Calando seems to be quite backward in this respect. This situation should be caused by the beast god and the dragon of eternal and time. The beast god seems to be more intensive in combat, and in the aspect of guiding and exploiting, the dragon of eternal and time. It has long been a fairly complete system, and I don’t know how to take out dozens of streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland and Calando believe in different power systems, Noland is undoubtedly a magical world, and Calondo is more adoring the original power. In Noland, the big and small lords are used to using the power of magic to change the environment and improve the output of various products, so you can see the green carpet-like paddy fields and forests everywhere in Noland. And the mines roared by the alchemy machinery, but in Calando, nothing can be seen. There are some big rivers on this continent, the rivers are even tens of kilometers, but in the hundreds of kilometers from the river, Li However, he only saw a piece of dry land that relied on the rain. If the water in the river was led, the output of those fields could at least double, but hundreds of years or even thousands of years passed. Those dry fields are still the same. Changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, Richard saw about a hundred tribes. You are welcome to say that if you remove the factors of the strong, then the troops scattered in the face of each other can be gathered up, at least two or thirty tribes can be swept away. It is the gap between Noland and Calando. If it is not a sea block, perhaps Noland has already leveled Calando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the strong is a factor on the other hand, the Karando mainland is hiding in the dragon, at least in the top of the strong is not inferior to Noland, which is also The key to maintaining the balance of the two continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is thinking about it, suddenly there is a woman’s voice next to him: “Do not eat thirsty like this.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around and saw that it was a young woman of twenty or so. She was quite beautiful. She had the unique British spirit of a barbarian woman. She had a pair of bright eyes, and she was not blind at the moment. Looking at Richard, seeing Li turned around, she handed over a cowhide water bag and said, "This is the wine we brewed in our tribe. It tastes good and is not very strong. It is just used to quench your thirst." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Richard took the water bag and drank a big sip. He only felt a pungent straight down the abdomen, and he coughed a few times. The barbarian 'is not very strong' wine, but it is too hotter than the spirits he has ever drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a big laugh behind the two men: "Where is the little sheep, drink the wine and smash it like this, this is the man you see, Nothing can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young woman is furious and replies without saying back: "Ban bear, this is not your business, if you dissatisfaction, we Come and fight one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior named Wild Bear seems to be quite afraid of the young woman, snorted and said: "This kid must be Don't play on the court, otherwise, hey, let him know that I am amazing tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao sipped his drink and looked at the burning fire The path is self-conceived. The words of the bear are not in his ears. The young woman saw this look like Li, but he sighed and said, "You don't have to be afraid of him. He doesn't dare to do it, you... It looks very good, not like a tribe, it looks a lot like a person, and it looks better than him. My name is Gesang. My camp is there. You can come to me at night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she left the fire and walked to her camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wine bag." Richard waved her cowhide bag to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to you." Gesang did not say back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are whispers in the side, mostly disdain for the seemingly weak performance of Richard. The barbarians are the most dignified and martial, and Richard is silent in this way. The move has made most people look down on it, and it has made Gesang quite disappointing, but Richard does not care about this. He cares about eating and drinking. At this moment, his three consciousnesses are thoughtful, and the main consciousness is going to be all The war skills and magic that have been experienced, seen and even heard are reviewed one by one. The second consciousness is still studying the sacred fighting techniques. The level of reaching the Russian and Russian can only be said to be the second level. The third level, as for the third consciousness, simulates the volley once and for all, and each knife must be equally good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three senses have their own divisions, and Richard has shown a absent-minded look. After eating and drinking, he returned to the camp and slept on his own. The invitation was left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the preliminaries of the festival began formally, and the entire platform was divided into dozens of areas, each of which was held at the same time, as long as the area was played. It is also lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1908, Richard, Richard." A voice sounded, and Richard sang out of the warriors who participated in the competition. For a while, in the ordinary barbarian two meters, Richard is indeed short and thin, and Richard's opponent is a warrior who is two meters long and grows like a bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, the beast is on, it turns out that you are a coward who hasn't planted. Ok, I don't bully you, let me smoke two. Even if you slap in the face, you won, and tonight, Gesang’s camp is mine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the bear immediately provoked the onlookers’ screams The tradition of barbarians, the hero who wins is the right to have a girl's camp, unless the girl wins him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, and for many days forced to press the murderous murderous and eager to move, the wild bear made him think of many traditions of the barbarian, but also think of the holy code Meaning, and the picture of the mountain and the sea in memory reappears, let him drive away, and refuse to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly retracted his hands into his sleeves, because his fingertips were already red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
