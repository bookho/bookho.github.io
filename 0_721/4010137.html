			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard soon found a beautifully beautifully arranged altar The small hall, where the Zuka statue was also destroyed, reveals a cracked wall behind the statue. From the perspective of broken cracks, you can see that there is still a secret storage space inside. After detecting no energy and magic fluctuations, Richard carefully opened the door of the closet. There is a small space behind the secret door, which is filled with a tightly sealed copper bottle. The copper bottle constantly overflows with a strong life. This life is full of violent and powerful taste. A few trolls carved on the copper bottle, Richard, recognized it: the blood of the Holy Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the Holy Spirit? Is it the blood of Zuka? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surprised and happy. This powerful blood has too many uses, and it is simply a treasure that can be encountered. If you wish, you can also sacrifice to the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly rushed to the sand, carefully observed the copper bottle for a while, tested it with the power of time, and finally rummaged through the book of time. For a long time, I was sure to say: "The blood of the Holy Spirit here should be the blood of Zuka. This should be the second holy device of the Troll Empire! In the era of the Troll Empire, the Great Sacrifice will take the blood of the Holy Spirit. Only able to communicate with the Holy Spirit and possess some of the power of the Holy Spirit. We are fortunate that Zuka is obviously an extremely powerful existence, its body may have died, but these blood is still energetic."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of the creation of his unicorn, and immediately lowered his voice and said to the flowing sand: "This bottle of the Holy Spirit is not good for the mother nest."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainbow nodded and said: "It is true that the evolution of the hen's nest requires a lot of powerful creatures. I don't know what level of life is Zuka, but like this kind of wisdom, you can absorb the faith. The Holy Spirit should not be worse than the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood Holy Spirit a good income. Although this trip to Jubwar took a huge risk, especially the gun of the Warlord’s soul almost killed his life, but in the end it was shocking and rewarding. The best maple scent amber is a huge fortune, and the two sacred objects cannot be measured in gold. Although Richard lost nearly 20 elite-level fighters, it was worth the money. Twenty elites, the mother nest was produced in ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Li’s mind was still unfinished, and he suddenly remembered that there was a third piece of holy device. But all the warriors turned the temple over to the sky and couldn't find anything of value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand was checked in the book of Time for a long time, and then the stone monument was repeatedly studied, and it was found that the third piece of the holy device may be related to the great sacrifice. It is said that it is an artifact that can carry the Zuka gods and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing to say, go to the sacrifice area!" Richard immediately decided. The three saints have already got two pieces, and they have never let go of the third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The festival area is on the lower level of the right side of the temple. The terrain here is even a few meters higher than the Emirates. At the innermost level of the stone temple where the Great Sacrifice is living, there is a stone table dedicated to artifacts. There was a strange huge parchment on the top, and something was written on the paper with blood. It is only because of the long-term relationship that the blood on this parchment has turned into deep purple, close to black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw this piece of parchment, Richard immediately exclaimed: "The book of the bearer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This piece of parchment has a very familiar atmosphere, and is resonating with the two books in his arms. No need to find it, Richard knows that the page of this book is the third holy device of the troll empire! He strode to the stone table and picked up the residual pages of the book, and wanted to merge directly with the existing pages in his hand. However, when Richard thought about it, he called the quicksand and asked her to see what the trolls had written on this residual page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand took a few minutes to interpret the contents of the residual page. That is the shrine of Zuka, and a message from the last generation of trolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The translation of Zuka’s gods is as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The river of life will dry up, The troll capital will be turned into ruins. Jubval will die in the dryness and dust, until the river of life re-flows, will recover. The source of chaos is in the pale highlands."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Troll Grand Sacrifice left a post similar to a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven rivers of life have disappeared six times. The last wave of the river was flooding a month ago. We can only look at the cracked riverbed now. Prayer. But Zuka has disappeared for a long time, has it abandoned us, or entered the pale highlands to find the source of chaos? There are dwarf kingdoms, these small ones are very difficult to deal with. But all life The rivers originated in the pale highlands, and they had to cross the dwarf's kingdom to figure out why they dried up. But the stubborn little men refused to give way, so I decided to put them on the spears for our warriors. Edible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water level in the water well of Zhubwal is rapidly declining, and we will soon be drinking water. It is imperative to fight with the dwarf!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the contents on the residual page, Richard finally saw the old days. A scene of the demise of the troll empire. All the rivers dried up and the wells dried up, and Jubwar immediately became a dead zone. The trolls had to evacuate the dead land, and they might have gone to other places, perhaps to death on the pale highlands. In the end, Zhu Buval was dusty and turned into ruins under the erosion of years. The troll capital has also become a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still many puzzles in this place, such as why Zuka would predict the arrival of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is recorded in the book of Time on the page of the time, and then Richard puts the page with the remaining pages in his hand. After a strong surge of energy, the book of bearing in the hands of Richard suddenly gave off a strong radiance, so that everyone could not open their eyes for a moment. When the light dissipated, the three residual pages in the hands of Richard were merged into one book of ordinary size. The book cover was cast from bronze, engraved with complicated patterns, and a row of flowing sand was also unrecognizable. God. The book seems to have more than a hundred pages, but Richard can only flip through three pages no matter how it is turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third residual page is merged to provide an extra magical space for the book to be stored. The five books with the highest level of seven can now be stored in the book. But all the magic has to be injected by Richard himself to take effect. The current book of hosting, in terms of attributes, can completely reverse the outcome of a magic matchup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed in Zhubula for two days and searched the troll capital thoroughly, but did not find more valuable things. If the mother's nest is here, the altar can be swallowed up. Richard was quite tempted by this idea and decided to take time to bring the nest to Zhubwal after the completion of the line plan, and then clean up the troll capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
