			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think that the volcano in the center of the floating island was the family cemetery of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Gordon out of the back door of the castle, as soon as he stepped on the volcano, Richard immediately noticed a slight fluctuation in the surrounding space. Without any signs, the lush, condensed forest turns into a world of red and black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh, warm air has disappeared and replaced with a strong scent. The sky is no longer blue, but densely covered with red clouds in the lead. The surrounding area is extremely hot, and the pleasant temperature on the floating island seems to be heated instantly. The high temperature seems to condense into a flame at the next moment, igniting the hair and skin, making Richard feel unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcano consists of dark volcanic rocks with an irregular path leading to the crater. At this time, the volcano is no longer just a gentle appearance of the smoke, but the entire mountain is shaking from time to time. Looking at it, you can see the fire and smoke from the crater squirting. The sky is blended with the dense clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main body of the volcano is no longer the height of 50 meters that was once seen, but it is pulled up to nearly a kilometer high, and lava will emerge from the crater from time to time. The lava flows over the edge of the crater, like the flowing river of fire, slowly slamming down and gradually solidifying on the way, turning it into part of the entire volcanic mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that the volcano is constantly shaking, the lava is always pouring, but except for the fire, the smoke, the lava river is dynamic, the rest of the mountain has never changed. Even the stones are not loose, and the cracked rocks are not seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly searches for memories, is this the equipment with space attributes that the teacher said in the magic equipment class! With this in mind, Richard couldn't help but have a moment of sorrow. According to the books he read, the biggest thing is just “lost paradise”. The space after the expansion is equivalent to a large laboratory in Deep Blue. The volcano, which is nearly a kilometer high in front of it, can't imagine how it was built. Look at the size and duration of this eruption. It must be connected to the fire element plane. It may directly accommodate a half-plane, perhaps this is Another miracle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the path, there are undulating volcanic mountains. On the dark black rocks, there are erected tombstones of different sizes. But the shape of these tombs is very strange. There are only standing tombstones, and there are no tombs under the usual semicircular protrusions. Moreover, the number of tombstones is not too large. Looking at it, it is sparse and there are hundreds of tombstones on the entire volcano. In addition, Richard also noticed that the closer to the crater, the fewer the number of tombstones. Archimonde's history is not long, but it has been passed down for hundreds of years. There should be at least tens of thousands of tombstones on the family cemetery. And with the scale of this volcano, even hundreds of thousands of tombstones can be squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon went all the way up, and Richard followed silently. He found that the volcano is actually divided into five levels. The upper one level, the less the number of tombstones, but the material is better, and the inscriptions are gradually extended from a simple name to a brief introduction to a life story. Soon, Richard and Gordon stood on the edge of the crater, the lava solidified ten meters away, and the hot air flow came over, almost making it difficult for Richard to open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard knows that the place where he stands now is the highest level of the Akmon family cemetery, and is also the place mentioned by his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest level of the entire family cemetery, but there are only six tombstones inside. The monument is cut from dark black solidified lava, without any decoration and redundant carvings, like a piece of original square rock. On this level, there is no major life story on the tombstone. Each tombstone has only a name, an unusual name, and is written in a language that Richard has never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as he saw those names, Richard immediately read them out gently, just like the ability brought from the blood, and he knew this text by nature. And while reading them, Richard only felt that every drop of blood in his body was shaking with a syllable. Every name seems to contain incredible power, and let Richard feel that there is something sleeping in the depths of his body that is about to wake up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a magical one to read the names on the six tombstones before he woke up from his dreams. When Gordon saw this scene, he nodded and said, "Yes! Your blood is very pure. It is very likely that you will rest here in the future and return to the land of the ancestors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard still has not recovered from the shock, the ear still echoes the bleak and distant roar, like an ancient existence is constantly shouting, penetrate the time space, seems to be within reach. He glanced at the six tombstones, but never dared to read the names on the tombstones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The six strongest Akmons are buried here. They all understand some secrets in the depths of the blood and awaken the true blood heritage. So they have their own real names. They are very talented, and they have the genius of real names when they are still weak. But half of them are strong people who don’t have the talent but get the real name in the battle of blood and fire!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon paused for a moment before continuing: "The real name is the biggest secret of every Archimonde and the source of our strength. You should have just experienced it." Every real name has a powerful power, and it is different. With the real name, we actually touched the most basic rule of the plane. Although it may be small and undetectable, it is the power of the rule and the final result. The only way to understand the rules. The real name brings us strength and is our biggest secret. Once someone has mastered our real name, it means that she has mastered our life and death. She only needs to read our real name. We will know the message she wants to pass to us. And if that person reads our real name and gives the most vicious curse, even an ordinary person without power will let us immediately go from the plane.湮 !!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart trembled and asked: “If this is the case, then why should let others know the real name?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon caressed the short beard, smiled low and said: "Bad boy! One day, maybe you will meet such a person, let you tell her willingly. Real name, in fact, only to be able to know when she misses you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is silent again, he seems to remember his mother at a very young age As mentioned, his father has a long and long name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks around the highest floor of the cemetery. Although there are only six solitary tombstones, he feels that each tombstone has some invisible and huge pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some hard questions: "Only the only real name of Archimonde will be buried here"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorton calmly looked at Richard, his gaze once again made Richard feel a panic, as all the secrets were known. Just as Richard began to sweat constantly, Gordon finally said: "Only Archimonde can be buried here. After I die, there will be a seventh tombstone here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are people outside of Archimonde"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon said meaningfully: "That needs to be all Archimonde's consent includes me. Richard, your body is also filled with the blood of Archimonde. After you die, here will be your belonging. So you should know how to get it. The consent of the grammonds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
