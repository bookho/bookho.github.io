			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as he entered the backyard, Richard suddenly felt a strange feeling, so Quietly standing, the strength of the hand also changed, stabilize the momentum of the hospital door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backyard is large, but it was originally the place where the sundries and horses were piled up, so it looked disorganized. Under the thick night, there is a ghostly white figure fluttering back and forth, the night is thick like water, gently sliding on both sides of her body, and gathered together behind her. Therefore, the white underwear that should have been extremely eye-catching has also become blurred, and if a gray lightning is coming and going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a splash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li quietly stood by the door, not to alarm her. The girl did not seem to know anyone, but she kept rushing in the backyard, and the messy courtyard did not bother her. Her speed is lightning fast, silent and silent, as if it is integrated with the night and the surrounding environment. Looking at the speed, Richard knows that the girl has successfully advanced, and this speed should be the special ability she got when she was in the promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the girl seemed to be a little tired at first, so she flashed in, appeared in front of Richard, raised her face and stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her carefully and asked, "Are you promoted? What is the new ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The girl snorted, slowly and screamingly said: "Ten. The new ability... can call it popular, just that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl's The eyes are pure and wild, but there are a few other things in the depths. She is still a short haircut that is cut out by her own guide. The sturdy tone of oysters means that she rarely talks to others, even after she has followed Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few words, Richard knew that he had overlooked the soul guard too much in the past. She is like a lone wolf, always careful to avoid the crowd, but she did not take the initiative to approach her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and said, "Fashion? It looks like a very powerful ability. I will come back to you after a few days. See if it can give you more What kind of structure is there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes flashed a trace of glory, but did not say anything, just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the wine has just retreated, the headaches began to burst, and the pain was unusual, just like something is tearing his consciousness. Richard snorted low, glared at his forehead, waved at the girl, and walked upstairs to his room. The Orc's wine tastes bad, but the intensity and stamina are absolutely strong enough. Richard resisted the severe headache and returned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the room, Richard habitually glanced at the entire room. This is the habit he developed when he followed Naa to learn the art of the dark world in the dark blue. No matter who, if every other day or two will be sneaked in various ways when entering any room, it will develop such a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a habit. After a glance, Richard was ready to throw himself into the bed. But suddenly, his body suddenly stiffened, and all the cold hair was rooted up, even the breath stopped! His line of sight was slow, one meter and one meter, and swept the entire room from left to right. All the data that is usually ignored in the field of view becomes clear and deliberately enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard finally determined that the abnormal light was light, and the bedroom was darker than normal. The room was open with a window. Although the haze covered the moon and the stars outside, there was still some night light, and the room should not be so dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-adjusted his vision, this time focusing on the distribution of light and shadow, so the rows of data outline a cloud of shadows, from The end of the room slowly floated toward Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally slowly spit a little, his right foot traversed, and the whole person slowly moved to the right. Just two meters away, the nameless long knife is leaning against the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow seems to have noticed Richard’s change and suddenly stopped, so a very strong sense of danger hits Richard’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of him, the shadows began to converge in one place, condensing together, and a creature like a female tiger appeared in the room. It is made up of solid shadows, but it gives a strangely smooth black feel. In the eyes of the eyes, there are two faint red lights, staring at Richard coldly. From these eyes, Richard felt only cold and desolation, no mood fluctuations, and no deterrence and intimidation common to hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind those two reds, nothing but emptiness and coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it stopped and formed a short burst of time, Richard also seized the opportunity to move two steps, holding the handle of the long knife. The heart immediately settled down. He has now identified the creature, and lightning has flashed information about it in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Leopard, a type of low-level shadow creature, known for its speed and blackmail. Although it is the lowest class of shadow creatures, it is also a true shadow creature. The entire group of shadow creatures wanders between the various planes. Most of the time, they live in the void outside the plane where only the violent energy exists, so it is a very powerful and mysterious race for the creatures in the plane. Even the lowest-level shadow leopard has the equivalent of 11th and 2nd level of combat power, and it has the wisdom far beyond ordinary beasts. The intermediate shadow creatures are no worse than the wise men and the big magician in humans. The wisdom of high-order shadow creatures can even surpass the legend and go straight to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the leopard in front of Richard began to crouch, this is the sign that the beast is going to launch a fight. However, just as its hind paws began to collapse, Richard suddenly burst into a strong scent of fire, while the silvery moon on the top of the head flashed away, and the long blade edge had been stained with a silvery moon force. Suddenly flew up, from the bottom up to the front of the shadow leopard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbreak, Moon Sword, for a moment, Richard has used all the cards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow leopard has already been saved, but in a mid-air position, however, it maintains a slowly crouching posture, making people feel very awkward. However, it was like this, but it just happened to hit Richard's blade, just like sending himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frosty moon, the spiral corridor, as long as the enemy is exposed, the ensuing attack will follow the pattern, until the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade cut into the shadow of the leopard's body, but the other party does not seem to want to get out, but the adhesion comes out from all directions, wrapping the blade. The nameless long knife suddenly fell into a swamp, and it became very difficult to go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee does not think about it, holding the knife in both hands, screaming, the whole body is bursting, the fourth month of the blue sky is again on the top of the head, and the monthly force on the blade is also Silver turns blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
