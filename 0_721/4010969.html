			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently nodded and thought about the action plan again and again. Several times, consciously without any loopholes, with the end of the undirected trip, the eternal vortex of one of the most dangerous dangers in the void is known to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half-rì, Richard and Wu did not arrive at the scheduled position. Only when I saw the eternal vortex with my own eyes, Richard really felt the greatness and wonder of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where the order and chaos are intertwined, and the huge vortex occupies the entire field of vision. It may be that the diameter is measured in terms of billion kilometers. Richard is sending it all at once, and I am afraid it will take several years to fly out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him, the purple mist that represents the power of chaos, intertwined with the crystals of the stars that represent the order, slowly rotate around the center, see Going up is like a huge and colorful river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the order collides with chaos, there is occasional blazing flame, which is by no means a flame in the general sense. This kind of flame, which is said to reach the limit of several million degrees, can survive without any life. Even if the super strong is close, it will be immediately turned into nothingness, and even the ashes will remain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this time of travel, Richard already knows that in the void, any smashing color means terrible danger, so the more beautiful the scene, the more The more you should be careful to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he agreed to take the decision. Because only the indefinite has tried to penetrate the eternal vortex, to explore the habitat of the stone man. Seeing the eternal vortex at the moment, Richard was glad that he was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the vastness of the eternal vortex, no one guides, even if he spends his life here, he would not find the habitat of Shiman, but would like to find it. A clue related to Su Hailun. And there is no limit, saying that without her, she is dead and will not tell Richard how to enter the eternal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to him, "How should we go in? Wouldn't it fly like this? I am afraid that ten years will not be reached."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Nothing to say, she volleyed a little to the front, fingertips out a few lines of purple sè, and in the end it extended to a very far place, then there was a flash of purple, actually There is a small stone platform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many natural transfer points here that can save us a lot of effort. You see, there is one there."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha once again felt the magic of creation, with a dozen consecutive transmissions, came to the stone platform. The stone platform is not big, only a few hundred square meters. Above the stone platform, there is a group of deep purple sè that the fog is slowly spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a natural space passage, but I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shitai has traces of artificial construction, each with a bronze terracotta brazier. Three of the brazier represent space and one represents time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brazier uses the magic crystal as the combustion medium. When someone ignites the four braziers, it forms a complete set of time coordinates, which can be in a certain range of voids. Guide the explorer to this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone has been here?" Richard inspected the four braziers, some asked with dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few purple light bands in the hands, and they are busy to stabilize the natural passage, saying: "The more dangerous place, the opportunity The bigger the number. Every decade, there will be some fools who want to come here to find opportunities. These fires of time and space are prepared for the legendary level of idiots. Here is the danger that the superpowers have great degeneration. Most of the waste that is only legendary is one to die. But here the legend can lead to the dark side of the world, so in theory, there will be some treasures that can make life evolve to a higher level. It is one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is like that, and Richard is quiet. Gradually, a magnificent picture was unfolded in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past thousands of years, generations of generations have continued to explore the eternal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come from different races and come from different planes, but the goal of exploring the unknown and finding the ultimate meaning is the same. Most of them are legendary, and they simply do not have the ability to transmit thousands of kilometers like Richard. And for legends, there are so many factors that can threaten their lives. They are so cautiously moving forward and deepening. Sometimes it takes hundreds of years to go back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the discovery of these natural transmission points, they found a shortcut. But these natural transmission channels are not necessarily shortcuts, and sometimes they are fatal traps. To find out the direction of each natural transfer point, it is also necessary for the strong to build up with life and flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first place to find the natural transfer point is a super strong person in the Ahn'Qiraj plane. It does not hide its own discovery, but its coordinates. Opened, and built a time lighthouse that can guide the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This superpower finally chose to explore the center of the eternal vortex, and there is no news ever since. Since then, natural transmission points have been discovered, in order to commemorate the Ahn'Qiraj superpower, and to facilitate future generations, anyone who finds a natural transmission point will set up various types of time coordinates next to it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, generations of generations are step by step, gradually moving toward the depths of the eternal vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard is such a natural transmission point, but this natural transmission point is dominated by chaotic power, and the other end of the channel must not be a safe environment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the road finally stabilized, and said to Richard: "Let's go! Be careful, the other end of the passage is completely the area of ​​chaotic power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and uttered a chaotic word: "Guardian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few deep purple sè light belts came out from the body of Richard, and quickly weaved several auras, enclosing Richard inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the pure chaotic power in the aura, the infinite eyes flashed and then calmed down. She also burned the purple flames around her body, protected herself with the power of chaos, and then jumped into the channel of the purple sè, and Richard followed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spatial transmission based on chaotic power is quite different from the transmission of Richard's past. Within the passage, Richard lost all the time and space that could be used as relative coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are chaotic energies of purple sè everywhere, and Richard’s own perception is completely chaotic. He feels that he is still and will feel himself for a while. It is spinning at a rapid speed. However, because there is no coordinate that can be referenced, Richard does not know the state he is in now, nor does he know whether his perception is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the transmission channel was re-established, and the moment of perception was re-established. Richard was almost happy to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the channel, he was looking at him with a smile, and it was obvious that Richard’s reaction was not unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was a little angry and was about to fly to nowhere. As a result, he suddenly turned a few signs and ran to a few kilometers. When Richard was on the spur of the moment, he discovered that his body had not completely recovered from the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally learned this time, first to release the perception, use the special ability of his space lord to firmly anchor the time and space, and then monitor each body Instinctive reaction, this is only a steady flight to no fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing flashes the surprise sè, says: "It’s really good. From this chaotic channel, you can adjust it so quickly, you still see me. The first one. Others have adjusted a lot of things all day long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You choose this channel, not to toss me Let's?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not. In fact, this channel is nothing at all. If you are in a foreign domain, you will often encounter an area that is completely composed of chaotic rules. It will be in such a state, unless you move to control the chaotic rules, otherwise you will not be able to survive. It will take a long time before you will be crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard now has a deep understanding. He was so sad when he stayed in the channel for a while, but he could not survive for decades in a similar environment outside the domain! These years, I really don't know how she came over. If it wasn't for her madness that pushed all emotions to the extreme, she couldn't hold on to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate madness and the ultimate in reason, have a very strong will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and there was a smoky black smoke everywhere. He reached out and took a group of purple and black mists and observed them carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real world, the energy and rule changes in the fog gradually appear. In fact, it has no entity at all, just the realization of chaotic energy. Purple gas is pure chaotic power, while black smoke is the impure energy that chaotic power is gradually eroded by order and other ruled forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
