If you think that this unit has insufficient combat power, it is a big mistake. There are already several powerful barbarians. The tribes ate a big loss in their hands, and even some tribes were completely annihilated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the team, two servants of the servant were riding The old man on the left hand side is old, the wrinkles on his face are as deep as the knife, and the other side is the middle-aged mage, but his face is covered with some abnormal black-black,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men are Clark, one is Sandru, a combination of a powerful priest and a necromancer, it is a bit strange, but they are now seventeen, in Faro, this is already A daunting level, and in this army, there are hundreds of 10th-level humanoid knights, and this fearlessly dead nesting unit has become a barbarian's nightmare,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the march, Sandro suddenly looked, side Listening to what he listened to, then said to Clark: "The master is calling the followers, we all need to return to the blue water oasis within a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Shande Lu had received a briefing from Richard to let him deal with an insider/rape. Because he needed the man’s body to accept public executions, he had to use the “soul imprisonment” to get rid of the inner and traitor’s soul before it happened. Uncontrollable accidents, but when Richard knew that both Sandro and Clark were thousands of miles away, and they were about to reach the next target, let them continue. After the war ended, go back and deal with it. /奸,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, I received a call for the order, or for all the followers. Obviously, the situation in the blue water oasis has changed. Clark hesitated, but nodded,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a thousand kilometers ahead, they will reach the true core of the Zuyuan Highlands, the last temple of the Highland God of War, and the current pope are there, to capture the temple, the high gods are in the world The foundation is equal to being completely cut off. Clark’s hatred in his life will be relieved, and the foundation of faith on the human world will be lost. The reawakened highland god of war will fall from weak power to endangered power. After a while, his god The country will also be shaken, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark does not know whether Richard has the ability to break into the gods of the gods, but as long as the Highland God of War is pushed further toward the fallen abyss, as For a mortal, it is a brilliant victory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal is now in front, but to return, for Clark, it is a tough Decide, After he smiled a bit, he said: "Since this is the official convening order of Richard, we certainly have to go back, but what about the troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land of the gods, when we get there, we are not too late to rush to the blue water oasis, anyway, the time limit is one month.” Shandru said,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark Nodded and said, "Well, you think that this time, Richard suddenly summoned us for what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru pondered for a moment and said: "Maybe, it’s a new war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark sinks: "Do you need such a large-scale call, even the ancestral highlands are put aside? If it is a war of this size, I am afraid that the target is not the Iron Triangle Empire, or the war with a certain god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru said: "Zuyuan The barbarians in the highlands were killed when the sands were still there. Now we have only time to clean up, and it’s no big deal for the time being. Clarke frowned and shook his head: "I'm afraid it's not that simple. Look at the highland gods behind the barbarians. We have twice thought that our church will be completely scrapped." As a result, it rebuilt the Great Temple in a new place, and every time the priests and priests we met did not significantly degrade. The reunion and collection speed of this belief is very abnormal, in the ancestral highlands. In the deepest part, the place called the initial city always makes me feel the vague fear. I always feel that there is something hidden there. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru looked at Clark unexpectedly and said, "I can make you feel the fear too. You are a great priest. The emotion that you shouldn't have when facing the pagan god is fear, but it doesn't matter, the master has returned. After all, Faro’s level is no less than Noland. Even if there is something hidden there, we can’t deal with it. The owner will always find a way.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark’s mind is slightly stable Some of them began to issue orders. The army of 5,000 people turned around and turned back to a camp. At this time, Sandru suddenly received another order and said to Clark: "The master asked me to return to Lanshui Oasis City immediately. The soul of the important prisoner is dealt with first, and the star who picks me up is already on the road, for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will arrive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark nodded, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra was a follower of Richard, signed a magic contract, harsh and powerful magic The contract also brings some benefits, that is, it is far apart and can pass The soul keeps in touch, although there are still distance and time restrictions, but both Richard and Sander have more than 16 levels, and they are also magicians. They have the basis of magic communication, so it is easy to achieve two-way communication. Clark has always followed the sand, and there is no direct affiliation with Richard itself, so there is no direct contact, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of their gods is the ancestors A large-scale emerging city on the source highland, its position is the original highland God of War, which was led by Richard and found the last mark,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God of War After the war, the temple was transformed into a new eternal dragon temple, but the true eternal dragon temple was not built by the void, but was relics scattered in various planes of the world, and then people built various forms on the altar relics. The majestic and magnificent exterior building becomes the eternal dragon temple. The core part of the eternal dragon temple is the altar. Like this altar that has not survived in the original ruins, it is completely new and the eternal dragon temple can only be sent. Part of the effect of the real eternal dragon temple, you need to have a strong priest to preside, in order to improve,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When building this eternal dragon temple, the sand is still there, she The Book of Time replaces the altar and presides the sacrifice. Therefore, although the effect of this dragon temple is not as good as that of the eternal dragon temple of Faust, it is also considered to be in the front of the non-fixed dragon temple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the construction of the Eternal Dragon Hall, with its core, the Three Goddess also built the temple here, and re-planned and built the city, began to migrate the population, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the city's establishment, it was identified as the strategic base of the deep red Principality in the ancestral highland. Therefore, a large number of clergy and military are concentrated here, and the number of church personnel and soldiers is even higher than that of civilians. The city is named as the land of the gods, to show the three goddess and the dragon of the eternal rule, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the establishment of the land of the gods, in fact, let the three goddesses I was flattered, although they signed the alliance treaty at the beginning, but as time went on, they began to fear the powerful god who secretly claimed the name,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, the theory of quicksand, now only accepts the belief is a dragon of the servant god before the real god, but the three goddesses can reach the power of time and the power of the dragon of time by their priests, the level of power Far beyond their imagination, the three goddesses don’t even dare to use their own divine power to touch the power of the dragon of eternal and time. The gap between the two sides is too big, if the two gods produce Alliance, the dragon of eternal and time can be forced to convert the three goddesses into the position of their own servant gods, so to what extent is the true god behind the eternal and time dragon, I am afraid that self-built gods can be, <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the land of the gods, light can be seen from the name, the dragon of eternal and time has no intention to rule on this land, and is willing to share teaching with the three goddesses Right, of course, let the eternal and time dragon succumb to the three goddesses in status, that is absolutely impossible,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to vain the person in vain The true God, only the eternal and the dragon of time is the existence that the three goddesses cannot understand. They never thought that there would be a god in the Faro that controls such a mysterious and powerful rule, and even more difficult to understand why the eternal and time dragons are on the parish, The believers and the power of faith are not interested. The two eternal dragon temples built by them are not the collection place of the power of faith, but more like a simple indication of their existence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard knows the three goddesses Confused, perhaps quoting what the big magi in the dark blue once said, the old dragon is taking two paw prints here,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When flowing sand After departing for the dark area, Io and Naiyou also left with her, and the eternal dragon temple of the land of the gods was replaced by Clark. The sacrifice function of this dragon temple is almost abandoned, and it can still be used here. Sacrifice, sacrifice can still get the grace of God, but the proportion of the grace of God is low, so in the case of the subordinates to receive sacrifices, Richard will choose to sacrifice in the vassal, two eternal dragon temples, It became a place to train the priests, but there was no distribution of the grace of the gods. The growth of the priests of the eternal dragon temple became very slow, similar to the priests of the three goddesses,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
