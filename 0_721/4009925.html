			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman, really only fifteen?" A serious face asked the big magician beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My magic doesn't lie, it's only fifteen!" The Great Sorcerer also replied solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great magician is still very young, almost the same age as Jarenville, and in the future is almost destined to become a big magician. Therefore, when Saranwell is respectful, he is also very clear that he will not go to the battlefield. Unless the war situation can reach the point of controlling everything, such a forward-looking, young and light-hearted guy will generally not be in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magician threw out a bunch of auxiliary magic at the beginning of the battle, completely fulfilling his obligation to follow the army, blameless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past battles of Salenville, there is absolutely no shortage of battles to achieve absolute control. Don't say a battle, it is a battle consisting of a series of battles, basically from the beginning to the end under his control, and according to his scheduled script evolution. Even with a small accident, the powerful reserve team that Saranwell used to keep was enough to smooth out all the accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of his ‘war artist’ was not blown out, but was laid by dozens of wars, big and small. In terms of leading the battle, he was only under the Li Shilongtu in the Iron Triangle Empire because of his young and senior reasons. At least, Sharonville himself and his men think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the past reputation, Salenville was selected to become the commander of this coalition. Otherwise, according to normal customs, how can it be the Sequoia Kingdom? The general is the highest commander. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this time, the Sequoia kingdom and the big lords who were still behind the front line were all secretly glad that the command did not reach their own hands. on. That is, Saranwell can maintain this battle in front of him, and change them. I am afraid that the tactical assault that has been smashed by the opposite female devil has shredded the line of defense and fell into complete defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butwells seems to be only a little longer than the time they support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the command area of ​​the city of Sarenville, the battlefield is a battlefield with thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thousand elites of the coalition have almost all entered the battle, and even hundreds of knights who are not counted in the two thousand figures have been put into the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least there are at least a hundred people in the vicinity of Allenville, but that are the guards of the nobles, belonging to dozens of nobles, There is no critical moment to be slain, and no one wants to be able to mobilize this group of people. Just like the fifty guards who are accompanied by Salenwell, they will not enter the battlefield. They belong to the Royal Knights and their duties are limited to protecting the safety of Saranwell himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition forces face up to 6,000 miscellaneous soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in this army, from fierce gangsters to ordinary men who only wave their weapons. However, on a one-on-one basis, the average man in the blood-stained area is stronger than the average kingdom soldier. The weak person does not have room to survive on this chaotic land. Therefore, the front line is staggered, and the two sides are mixed together in a chaotic situation. Naturally, it is advantageous for the number of people who are dominant and whose individual combat power is not at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the professional army on the battlefield lies in organization, discipline, and coordination. After the individual combat power is assembled into the strength of the army, it is not a simple accumulation, but a superposition. The well-trained battlefield can exert one and a half times the lethality of the year-on-year, and the morale will remain longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the front line of the battlefield did not see this advantage at all, the coalition forces could not maintain the formation, and which line under the command of Allenville Just a little neatly, the bears of the town will fall down like an indiscriminate hammer and crush all the resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black armor pierced the defense of the stubborn enemy, he would return to the square and re-arrange for the next order, and also get rest. Then they rushed to swallow up the chaotic front, and they were the servants of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great magicians of the Schumpeter family did not add auxiliary magic to the warriors. All their energy was on the other strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic showdown, there are already four 10th-level coalition magicians killed by squally magic, and there are three 12-level The priests became their victims. This shows the gap between the magical civilization between Noland and Faro. In the Faro plane, two great magicians of the same level face the most difficult wins when confronting these enemies, and it is impossible to destroy them like this. A little bit of bombing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sinclair is even more horrible, she always looks awkward, but at any time there will be hysterical outbreaks. The battlefield of the melee did not bother her, and wherever she went, and the ability to move similarly to the moment was so terrifying that she could always appear silently beside the target and then kill the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands, feet, knees and elbows, and even parts of the body can become weapons, and the dull, double-knife is sharp and terrifying. In front of the blade, the reloading plate of the Imperial Knight is just like the paper paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair did not attack a lot, but every time he reversed the local situation. The 16th-level priest, the 14th-level great magician, and the 16th-level sacred knight have died in her hands. And it is on the battlefield! Only the sacred knight's counterattack before the death let her spit a blood, it is black blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion is quietly crouching, and its huge figure of ten meters is itself an indescribable deterrent. Its combat power has not yet fully shown, it seems that it is only responsible for guarding her when Sinclair stays alone. Once there was a team of elite knights who broke through the miscellaneous soldiers and rushed to the lion lion. As a result, they were shrouded in a poisonous mist ejected from the tail needle, and they all died in half a minute. The lions that sprayed the poisonous mist also looked a little wilful, but after Sinclair fed the heart one by one, it regained its temper. No one dares to approach the ten-meter around the lion, and even the town bear knight is not willing to approach it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an elite division facing thousands of rabble, Saranwell originally thought it would be a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disadvantage of quantity is only superficial. He once commanded the experience of the Red Cossack Guard, letting him know that the real combat power of the nearly three thousand elite professional forces is actually Multiply more than the opponent. Not to mention the impact of the battle damage on the miscellaneous soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the war did not follow his expectations at all. The devilish girl also showed a keen sense of the battlefield. The strong fulcrum of the battlefield was one by one. Pulled out, the stable front was crushed and shattered by the town bear knight, and the battle finally turned into a melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
