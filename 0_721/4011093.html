			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stalemate, Richard flew backwards. This time, he was flying a kilometer, and the blood spurted out in the air to pull out a string of shining red beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stood still and did not move, and saw that Li Fei was far away, and this snorted, spewing a cloud of blood from the breathing hole of the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it hard to stop the post-flying trend, coughing a few times, and then coughing up a few mouthfuls of blood, which took a deep breath and looked Moonlight in the hands. On the blade of the moonlight, there was a small gap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha face sinking, looking up at the man in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight has an irresistible artifact attribute, but the so-called immutable damage is of course also limited, meaning that under the rules of the world, it is difficult to have the power Damage it. However, of course, this limit cannot truly reach the limits of the world rules, and can only be infinitely close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even the moonlight has been damaged, which only shows that the man is also an artifact with irremovable attributes, and his power is infinitely close to the rules of the world. The limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Li’s heart suddenly had an incredible idea. Isn’t he not infinitely close, but really reached the limit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shocking guess! Even Richard himself did not really reach the limit in power. Other attributes are actually the same, and they are only infinitely close to the limits of world rules. Before this confrontation, he once thought that the limits of the world rules would follow ordinary rules, that is, infinite proximity could not be equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the man is also watching the giant sword in his hand. There is also a gap in the sword of the Great Sword, which is significantly larger than the moonlight. It seems that the quality of this giant sword is still not as good as that of Richard in the hands of Richard, but the difference is extremely limited. If the two weapons are not in their hands, then this mutual damage cannot happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled a few times and said to Richard: "The kid! You are really tender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? The strength is a little worse than you, is it tender?" I don't know why, Richard wanted to refute the man, and he did the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's almost bad! The ultimate peak and infinite proximity are two different things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a strong and calm statement: "That can only show that we are taking different paths. You are at the pinnacle of strength, and I am just infinitely close. But I am infinitely close to the world's ultimate in any respect, you? I don't believe that in addition to strength, you can stand in other ways as well. On the peak of the extreme!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at Richard and said, "Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said calmly: "If this is the case, then you have been unable to stay in this world! There is no perfection in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly laughed, then raised a giant sword and said: "Less nonsense! Do you know if you have played it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察脸There was also a smile on the top, saying: "Also!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure disappeared suddenly and appeared behind the man, month The rate has exceeded people perceive to capture the range, the moment the knife to cut thousands of men! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each knife falls, leaving a crack in the space. In the twinkling of an eye, there are thousands of space cracks around men. But for men or Richard, these space cracks can be ignored, really deadly, or the blade of the moonlight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword also seems to have its own life, flying in the air. It is wide open, and every sniper is like a mountain, and it’s a thousand times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cross between the Great Sword and the Moonlight, most of the time is just staggered, but that's it, the gap on the Great Sword is more and more. It can be imagined that the blade of the moonlight must not be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the two people separated without warning, and stood opposite each other. The distance of 100 meters is very far away for ordinary people, but for Richard and this man, even if it is tens of thousands of meters, it is instantaneously available, there is no difference at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, a circle of invisible cockroaches is centered on the two and spreads around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaks of the mountains, which stretched like no end, suddenly disappeared silently, turning into stucco and being pushed into the distance. The earth continued to sink down and there was a crater hundreds of meters deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of this battle has spread to hundreds of kilometers. Except for the floating world, everything is destroyed!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the aftermath passed, the whole floating world was suddenly rising and falling, and some of the bottom floating islands disappeared silently. The followers on the floating world were pale, and from time to time some people ooze blood in their noses. The night elves in the floating world are dead in pieces. Although they have the strength to approach the sanctuary, there is no room for resistance in the battle of the true peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man glanced at his giant sword. The sword was full of gaps everywhere. It was so miserable that it had changed from a rare artifact to a big saw. The moonlight in the hands of Richard is not good enough. Although each gap is not large, but there are more than a dozen gaps on the blade that was not long, and it seems to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the next full blow, these two artifacts with irreducible attributes will be completely destroyed, and have since become the nouns that will appear in history books. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not care, swiping a powerful sword, and gradually spreading the magma around him, expanding in the void like a solid place, saying: "Kids! Come on, the last blow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Richard first held the moonlight with both hands, and the body appeared huge Tetrahedron, countless faces are being destroyed. That is the myriad soul that binds itself to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and slowly lowered the moonlight to his chest. Suddenly, a huge round of the blue sky appeared on his head, and Richard has merged with the moonlight, turned into light, turned into electricity, turned into destruction, and rushed to the opponent, never going forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife, no reservations, this knife, no defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ultimate destruction, not only to destroy the opponent, but also to destroy yourself. The elf secret sword, the bursting of the blue moon, finally reappeared its highest realm at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man seems to have bowed, and there is an undetectable hesitation when the sword is swung. However, in this peak matchup, even a little mistake will be infinitely magnified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard crossed the interception of the giant sword and appeared in front of the man in an instant. The moonlight fell into the chest and passed through the back of the armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge impulse caused two people to fall into the earth, and in the roar, added a new horrible wound to the earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge pit with a diameter of several kilometers. In the depths of the pit, Richard’s hands are firmly holding the moonlight, still stable, but his face is It is constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original expected loss has not occurred, but has become such a victory. Richard is trying to use the stronger defense and resilience of the body to compete for a glimmer of life, and then use the power of the real name to recover. But all the plans are not needed now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man below suddenly smiled and said, "It’s exactly the same as that day..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His laughter was replaced by a severe cough in a blink of an eye. This time his words are no longer the symbols of the abyss rules, but true and true. That is, Noland's human lingua franca! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this voice, Richard’s face suddenly faded, he didn’t even find his left hand let go of the moonlight, hurriedly stretched over and pushed up the man The visor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a majestic, but endlessly angry face, with a faint charm in the rough. This person, this face, once reminded Richard for a long time, and then had to bury it in the deepest part of his heart, and discharged it with his mother, and was afraid to turn it up again with the vortex of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s hand began to tremble, but he never dared to pull out the moonlight. Only Richard himself knows how powerful the ruin is, and that is the ultimate destruction. No matter what is stabbed, it will be completely annihilated. The power of this knife is enough to destroy a country of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight has been completely destroyed, and the broken holy knife can no longer carry the destructive power of the Blue Sword. Even the moonlight is broken, so what about people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, are you?" Richard finally said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I woke up, I was already one with the will of the abyss. I am the abyss, and the abyss is me. My natural duty is to guard this place and maintain the most basic order of the world. I, you can't walk from here. But you are very good! It is the son of my Gotton!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you say, the more spiritual, haha Laughed a few times, and took a heavy shot of Richard's shoulder, continued to praise: "Good boy! Really have you, actually brought the floating world here! I can do more than your father, haha, haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard looked at the man who was still flying like a flame, and moved his lips, but could not make a sound. His vision slowly blurred, his eyes were a bit stinging, and then the tears fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already gathered a pure ball of light in his palm, which is the purest force of life, and even resurrects those who have just died. However, Richard’s hand was lifted and lowered, but he did not dare to release this power. He was afraid that under the impact of life force, Gotton would immediately annihilate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard knows that it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand is holding, but there is no handle in the palm of his hand. The moonlight has already gone away, and Gordon is intact, and his chest can't even see the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon took another shot of Richard’s shoulder and said, "Boy! You, I’m already dead, I’m going to run to this damn place. I still can't see you! Don't be mother-in-law's mother, we Archimonde often bleeds, I have seen tears!? Right, if you have the heart, then help me pay the debts owed. I have been thinking about this matter. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and nodded to the left hand of the powerful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes stayed on Richard’s face, and the voice gradually turned lighter: “It’s like... Hey, I really want to take another look. ....Beautiful girl..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of Richard’s eyes, the vision is still a blur of clarity, only the face of Gordon It was getting weaker and lighter, and when it was a breeze, he turned into a piece of flying sand and went with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha maintains a hand with a slight hand and a slight lift, as if it has solidified into an emerald magic iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
