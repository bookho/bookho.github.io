			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final battle is unfolding outside the harbor of the fjord. The retreating Schumpeter family gathered all the remaining forces on the ground, and began a bloody battle with the devil and the devil. However, under the attack of the three small lords, they ended up losing both losses. There are only a hundred warriors left in the devil and the devil, and more than ten of them have successfully advanced. The Xiepide family army died more than half of the war, and the remnants of the army retreated into the port, ready to defend according to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schumpeter family has some defending forces in other territories, still waiting for orders, and the fierce debate on whether or not to increase troops has been It lasted for several days and no final conclusion has been reached. However, the war came to an abrupt end, and the three lords who completed the invasion mission returned to their respective planes with the big devil and the big devil. The abandoned soldiers will continue to rogue in Noland and will soon be wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gordon, at the moment, a few kilometers away from the horse, seeing that the two portals disappeared slowly, only waved the knights with their men to turn around and return to the family territory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the port city, the Marquis of Ryan is standing under the highest watchtower, looking at this scene from afar, finally uttered a long breath, and then smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Gordon finally retreated, the people around the Marquis were relieved. They are now afraid of Archimonde more than the devil and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in theory, Gordon has not been moving before, it will not choose to do this at this time, anyway, the Bear Peter family in this land The power has been completely destroyed, and the gradual encroachment afterwards is more legal, convenient and effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gordon attacked the Bear Peter family at this time, it would almost incur the condemnation of all the nobles of the human empire. It’s one thing to stand by and rob the fire. It is stepping on the bottom line of the aristocratic rule. The allies of the Schumpeter family can easily intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, who knows, Archimonde's most famous is their madness and never played according to common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a young man from the Bear Peter family asked questioningly: "The damn Archimonde neither fights the devil and the demon, but also Don't attack us, what do he want to do? Do they just want to come and see the beautiful Missing Fjord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can answer his question, but this The words fell in the ears of Marquis of Ryan, but it was like a thunder in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marquis screamed: "Damn! There is Dragon Master Lina in that team! Archimonde knows the coordinates of our family plane." !" The voice did not fall, the Marquis suddenly spurted a blood, his face instantly became pale, and the man immediately fell back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entourage around him helped the Marquis. Slightly able to gasp, Ryan couldn't wait to catch a follower and said, "Come, go get ready for me! I have to go to Faust, go now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, the Griffin was finally ready. The weak Marquis, despite the dissuasion of others, insisted on boarding the Griffin. However, at this time, the lion cubs of the Qing dynasty came in the sky, and a dozen lions formed a spectacular team to fly through the sky. They are flying in the direction of the Archimonde territory, and the destination is obviously also vagrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis swayed, only to feel a black front, and the lips began to seep out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments, the three lions took off from the port and flew to FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the weird invasion that lasted for nearly a week, more than half of the territory that missed the fjord was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields trampled by demons and demons, contaminated with the atmosphere of hell and the abyss, could not resume production for several years, and the collapsed mines wanted to be re-produced. It takes several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the continuous battle, the Xiepide family elite warfare killed nearly 4,000 people, and the construction of the knight killed fifteen, the remaining town bear knight Still less than twenty rides. After this blow, the armed forces of the Schumpeter family have fallen from the level of the giants to the level of the quasi-first-class nobility. It is almost inevitable that the floating islands will be cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious loss is the disclosure of two exclusive plane coordinates. From now on, it is possible to have Archimonde's army in these two planes at all times. The Schumpeter family has to station heavy troops in the plane. Even so, with this weak military force, they want to resist the tiger wolves. Archimonde is also an almost impossible task. Now the only thing Marquis Ryan can expect is to stop Archimonde in the battlefield of politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone knows that politics without the backing of force is like roasting soft cheese, and how others can cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the far-reaching Faro plane, Richard is unaware of the small episodes that have taken place on Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wrapped in a blanket all over his body and is asleep. It is already close to the desert, and the bare sands are rugged, reflecting the hot sun during the day and the world of fire everywhere. At night, the temperature drops rapidly and the chill will penetrate directly into the bones. Looking at it, I could hardly see a little life. Only a few clumps of cactus grew stubbornly in the shade of the sand dunes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a leeward Shifeng depression, Richard’s camp is located here. However, no tents were built, and hundreds of people were sleeping in a suit or wrapped in a blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are battles and escapes almost every day in the past few days. In the surrounding area, at least four or five hundred-strong escorts and snatching teams are waiting. Timing, I want to give Richard a fatal blow. The main players of these hunters are the red Cossacks, and the other half are the small business groups, horses and mercenaries of the vassals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunters are like wolves on the prairie. They come and go like wind and have excellent endurance. Therefore, the battle may break out at any time. Richard has no time to camp. During the rest of the night, I was sleeping with my clothes. I was able to get up and fight as soon as I got a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was very cold and quiet, and the snoring of the two ogres came from far away, but it gave people a strange sense of security. The chill made Richard involuntarily wrap the quilt, but there was a warmth of warmth behind him, which was close to his drifting sand. Only in the sleep, the sand will reveal the weak side, reminiscent of her being a girl who is less than 18 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold moonlight falls on this small temporary camp. The innermost circle is naturally a legal person such as Richard and quicksand, and then they are lying next to the old team that they have been from Noland. The outer periphery is barbarians, half-orcs, etc., and the ogre is crowded with them. The roar of the ogre was loud, and only the same barbarian and half-human talents with the same nerves were accepted. The outermost periphery is hundreds of Shamin fighters. Their robes are natural blankets, and even if they are rough and hard, they can fall asleep as soon as they lie down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
