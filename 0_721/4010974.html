Dear Richard After a long time, it’s really a pleasure to see you again. Although I know that you guys just come to me, there is no good thing. Let me say, what are the requirements this time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need information about the dark side of the world." Richard said directly to the local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin’s smile suddenly froze, and then some irritated and said: “Are you really omnipotent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not always possible to find some surprises in the church treasure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin snorted and said, "But that It is also possible to find it! I am not like you, I have faith! Do you know the meaning of faith? Faith is the most sacred, the most uncontestable thing! My faith is light, so any dark side with the world Nothing is touched, so there is no possibility of anything related to the dark side of the world in the secret database of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost. If Saint Martin does not know, then there is only one way for the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin calmed down a little and asked: "Why do you suddenly ask the world of dark faces? As far as I know, it is just a legend, there is no evidence to prove the world. The dark side really exists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "I have a definite reason to believe that my teacher, Su Hailun, lost in the dark side of the world. But Her passage to the dark side of the world was closed, so I wanted to find a new way to the dark side of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin was shocked : "You are crazy? We are all life on the light side. If you go to the dark side, it is like a water elemental creature entering the fire element plane! Don't say if you can get in, even if you go in, you can't live for a long time!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me find a way." Richard ignored the advice of St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I have a solution?" Martin said with a bit of annoyance, he turned around in the same place, like an ant on a hot pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I count on you to owe you a favor." Richard added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin waved his hand and angered: "Go! You have to go to the dark side of the world, there must be no return, this person can have a fart!" What's more, do you owe me less?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's rare swearing, outside his bad attitude, Richard feels that he is hiding Not so good care. Richard sighed in his heart, but his face still looked at Martin calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin didn’t know how many laps he had made, and he made up his mind and said, “Good! I will help you think about it, but don’t hold too much hope. There are some fragmented records about the dark side of the world, so you'd better go to the Millennium Empire to think of ways. I have seen a period of history, it is said that during the heyday of the spirit of the jīng spirit, it has organized a large-scale dark surface to the world. Exploring. So there may be answers you need on the green continent. But you also know that those high spirits are mad, they see that the first action of any life other than the same kind is attack."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cangqing mainland? Well, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's expression suddenly became very colorful, almost It’s a sigh of Richard: “Isn’t it clear enough? I’m talking about the Millennium Empire, not the green continent! Those high spirits are crazy, you simply can’t get any darkness from them. Information! They don’t need to exchange with you at all. What?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly replied: "If they refuse, I will find a way to make them willing! But I promise you, I will go to the Millennium Empire first. Try it there. If I get the answer, I won’t go to the green continent for adventure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s face is so good, he snorted, "What's the matter? Look at your appearance, the words are not finished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Really, I want Challenge the Pope in the near future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you really crazy?" St. Martin looked at Richard with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "I just want to solve the trouble as much as possible before leaving. And challenge the Pope and also be able to verify some of my conjectures. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin indulged for a while and said, "But I don't think this challenge is necessary. And I haven't finalized the real purpose of this old guy, and I haven't figured out whether he is a friend or an enemy. I don't want to take him. . become a real enemy addition, he is very dangerous "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Richard frowned:." I'm dangerous "<br /> <br /> & nbsp. ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin has some helplessness to spread his hand and said: "This way, I can arrange for you to meet one side. There is no need to fight, you can achieve the goal by meeting and chatting."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin sighed and said, "I heard that, You just won the undecided Queen Her Majesty. But that is your ability to restrain her, it does not mean that your strength can also overwhelm others. At least I have an instinct, the old things of the Pope may be restrained You will meet with him and you will know when you talk. In addition, your own troubles. Great, or do more to prepare it is not necessary surrounded by enemies "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Richard nodded, then cut off communication with St. Martin's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array of light gradually dimmed, and Richard stood still and thought. When Martin said the last paragraph, he had a sudden hunch, and soon he would encounter an unavoidable crisis, and he had to use the power of God to send to the dark field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the sand was specifically pointed out that it was necessary for Richard to defeat the Pope to go to the Dark. This may have deep meaning. In any case, it will be understood after the war with the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the study, Richard thought quietly, still not reconciled, so he set off for the Royal Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection in the Masters Association is the richest of the entire Noland, and is comparable to the Imperial Palace. Only the palace was almost completely destroyed in Richard and the indefinite battle. Because it was the collision of the two rules of order and chaos, even the protection of the secret library against the nine-level magic was not spared, and then annihilated. This is the loss that Richard did not expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Thor generously agreed to Richard’s request and opened the library to him. Of course, he still has a ‘small’ requirement, which is to buy a fifth-order magical arm from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price given by Thor is not low, but if the magical armed forces appear at the auction, it may not be so. Richard agreed to Thor's condition, but only put the time for the construction payment a year later. Old Thor didn't care about this time, and he was happy to send Richard into the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a whole day in the library and quickly browsed through the thousands of precious collections kept here. Unsurprisingly, the record of the dark side of the world is pitiful, and only a few paragraphs are ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read that it feels more of a fantasies and speculations, rather than the stories written by people who have actually been to the dark side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard walked out of the Library of the Masters Association with disappointment. If you can't find knowledge about the dark side of the world, there may not be all in the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the study, Richard’s eyes fell on the Millennium Empire. It seems that he had to run the Millennium Empire. In the ancient times, the jīng spirit empire once explored the dark side of the world, then in the millennial empire that inherited the half heritage of the jīng spirit empire, there may be records about the dark side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately called in a waiter and asked him to post a message: The Archimonde family will acquire a magical fleet that is capable of crossing the ocean. , arrived in the green continent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a fleet consists of at least five magical ships, with a total value of around ten top sacrifices. Richard is preparing for a direct acquisition. If he can't buy it, he will order a brand new magic warship from Dragon Blood Gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Millennium Empire still can't find information about the dark side of the world, Richard is ready to go to the green continent and go there to find descendants of the higher spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrangement of the acquisition of the Magic Fleet, Richard entered the library of the Stars and continued reading the detained loan. When entering the library, Richard suddenly thought that the ancient star family would not be as good as Noland's jīng spirit empire, nor knowledge about the dark side of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately began to examine the books that have not been unsealed. Looking at it, Richard suddenly stopped in front of a stone engraved with mysterious patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
