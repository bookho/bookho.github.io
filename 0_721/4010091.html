Special attention should be paid to several city defense giants. Although Richard does not believe that Baron Xiaofang Dan can afford to enchant the arrow, it is always correct to be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the team was ready to leave, Richard suddenly felt two burning eyes from the side, looking at it sideways, it was Io! Richard’s mood surged again, and he almost said that he would join the Gangde in the first batch of the dusk castle. The words went to the lips, and it was hard to press down. Richard is a magician and a commander. The idea of ​​entering the fort with the vanguard is absolutely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still fortunate, when he was not stunned, who knows that Io suddenly said: "I will go in with them." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting priests due to location and responsibilities, the means of life-saving is also much more. Richard is also not good to object, but somehow, the decision of Iraq and Russia makes Richard feel awkward. The joy of not even the bloody blade to capture the dusk castle was ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the entire dusk castle has fallen into the hands of Richard. The remaining strength of Baron Fontaine did not seem to be much supplemented in these days, so Richard’s presence was hardly resisted. In fact, after the Count of Latour led the army to retreat, the defenders had long lost their resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been in every corner of the castle, and even the secret room and cellar have not been missed. This is a habit for him, as long as he has seen it, he will remember it. After this time, the enemy would like to use the dusk castle as a stronghold, and the advantage of the geographical advantage will be greatly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the Baronet’s bedroom, Richard saw many unexpected special tools and props. Obviously, during the past time, the Baroness and the generals who occupied here have had a rather rich time, and it is not very reluctant, at least at the beginning. In those days when he thought of fighting side by side with Baron Fontaine, Richard’s face became more and more gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took another hour to walk through the entire castle. Now Richard’s subordinates have gradually become accustomed to his style and have begun to develop enough patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the castle, Richard saw the Baroness and Baron Little Fontain in the private study in front of Baron Fontaine. Richard sat directly on the edge of the desk, while Baron and the Baroness, sitting on the opposite chair for the guests, looked very restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first asked: "In the past, have you not been very happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On this issue, Baron Xiaofang Dan barely slammed his mouth and said nothing. Juveniles seem to have a lot of prejudice against Richard, especially for his pioneering knighthood, always showing the arrogance of a persistent aristocrat. The baroness was much more pragmatic and hanged her head deeply. Since she knew that Richard had circled the entire castle, she knew that he must have seen many things that could not be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee knocked on the desk under the fart/street and said, "Let me guess who used to sit behind this table in the past? Or Odom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness wants to keep silent, but knows that it is easy to irritate each other, so he said softly: "They all sat, But Count Latour is sitting more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said, "Mrs, you are very smart, but unfortunately, it is not wise. If you can stick to it at the beginning, maybe you will not fall to this point? It is better to be a neighbor than to be a group of wolves." Come to the house. What conditions did he give to you at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness sighed and said, "Give us your land, Then cut a part from the aristocratic territory of their vassal, and get enough of a viscount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A viscount! Even I am somewhat tempted, but this can Is it cashed?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness gently sobbed, this question does not need to be answered at all. In fact, during this time, the weapons workshop led by the Baron Fang Dan did not operate normally, but was taken over by the cronies of the Count of Latour. The Baron Xiaofang Dan did not even know that there were some What is only got the symbolic gold coin compensation. That gold coin, in the past, is not enough for the Baroness to purchase jewelry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li called a soldier and said: "Go and call Siss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment, Sisss went into the office. Seeing his mother and his brother, he was very excited, but he did not rush. The mother and brother used to stand on the opposite side of Richard, and Siso knew. However, he is also very aware of his father's wishes before his death, and he has completely implemented it. Now he has completely dedicated himself to the dragon of eternal and time, so he firmly stands on the side of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of Xisuo has reached five levels and is already an intermediate priest. At his age, this is definitely a proud achievement. So Xisuo stood there, and naturally there was an imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a shot of Sisuo’s shoulder and said, "Look, Xisuo is now a five-level pastor. It won’t take long before he will Become a noble grand priest. I miss the friendship of Baron Fontaine and admire his wisdom. Now...you can talk for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sisuo was very excited immediately, looking up and looking at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted his shoulder and said, "Don’t worry about time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Before the study, what Richard thought of, turned back and said: "Baron Baron, I just heard that your uncle was unfortunately falling into the cliff during the pursuit of the gangsters, and now life and death are unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little bard raised his head and said dryly: "Ah, is that true? It's a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee smiled, Push the door to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Baron Xiaofang Dan publicly announced that he would return to the Duke of the Wolf and become a vassal. And announcing an alliance with Sir Richard will punish all crimes committed against Richard on the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another week, the team loaded with building materials was led by Baron Fontaine and headed for the territory of Richard. There are also a variety of craftsmen, many of whom were originally taken from the territory of Richard. The Weapons Workshop on the Baron’s land is once again busy working, producing hundreds of superior armor weapons every month. These productions naturally flowed to the territory of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle of Richard can be started again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha only left dozens of soldiers stationed in the territory, the team reopened and returned to the blue water oasis. This is Richard's habit. As long as all the strengths are brought around, the territory is safe. Whoever dares to attack the idea of ​​Richard’s territory, the army will be destroyed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before returning, he sent a letter to the aristocrats who were adjacent to the blood-stained area, and invited them to send representatives to the Blue Water Oasis City to discuss a real event:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line plan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is to gather the strengths of the major aristocrats and several business groups, and work together to open a passage from east to west, through the blood-stained land! The end of the passage will reach the pale highlands of the northwest and establish a connection with the dwarf kingdom there. The revenue of the channel is distributed according to the input of the human and material resources of the participating parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the vertical line plan will have a fatal blow to the horses, thieves and even all the aliens on the road, and will also be against the iron triangle. The empire has a certain impact. It is precisely because of the danger of blood-staining places that many small caravans and groups are circling the Iron Triangle Empire. Although the route is elongated and various types of taxes are paid, it is still better than the people. Moreover, the red Cossack that Richard planned to completely destroy during this period is also a large-scale business group affiliated with the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line plan was invited to a very wide range, and Richard even sent an invitation to the Viscounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount is still a problem, but it is not so troublesome. In fact, from the beginning to the end, Richard only felt that the Viscount, together with the forces behind it, was only a trouble. A common feature of dealing with human-sized aristocrats is that it is easy to use various means to delay time. With the mother nest, dragging time is always beneficial to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great aristocracy, war will also be a very effective means of diplomacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the seven hundred cavalry led by Sir Odom, even a heavy blow to the Duke of Glasgow. Such a loss, no one year can not make up. The Count of the Deer was directly disabled, and the two great magicians and the two great priests all died. The squadron of the Golden Sphinx also died. The backbone of the Deer's lord lost most of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of losers does not seem to be large, but all are the most elite fighters. Odom is a strong sanctuary, and every sanctuary can play a great role. Otherwise, the Faro plane will not give each 16-level professional the title of the Sanctuary. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that if you fight with yourself, the Duke of Glasgow must carefully consider the gains and losses. After all, the interests of the other party are still unknown, and the losses are intuitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any person's plane, amazing news is delivered faster than the wind. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s troops returned to the Blue Water Oasis, the news that the Duke of Glasgow had slammed the death of Sir Odom had spread throughout the city. So when Richard returned to the army, various invitations and visits to the door were filled with his desk again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He directly swept all the pieces of paper into the trash basket with a wave of extinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he shut himself up, waiting for the representatives of the various nobles to come, and burying his head to draw the makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, this is Richard’s consistent diligence. On the other hand, he is somewhat reluctant to see Io, but he is not willing to ask for sand. In Richard's mind, the same question has been asked once, but it has not been answered. He didn't want to ask the second time again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
