			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mess in the forward base, a netted warrior quietly touched the corner I want to escape the wall. When he passed the door of a house, he suddenly felt something and glanced inside. At first glance, he showed a horrifying look on his way, instinctively opened his mouth and wanted to scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, his whole body suddenly shocked, the expression on his face was sluggish, and the two blood lines were directly ejected from the ear holes. Then a dark green waterline emerged from the door and spit in his mouth. The waterline is extremely corrosive, and the soldiers immediately make a buzzing sound in the mouth of the soldier, constantly emitting a large group of hookahs. He couldn't make any sound anymore, he fell down on his stomach, his hands covered his throat, and he rolled hard. Suddenly, two blades were found from the door, and the soldier’s calf was pinned and dragged in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Nest...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, its mental impact power is greatly enhanced, Also added an acid ejector skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrendered soldiers were taken to the cellar in the pub underground. Their injuries were simply treated and bandaged, and the two injured knights who were heavier injured even received a treatment for minor injuries. This allowed all the prisoners of war to temporarily settle down. Since the other god's officials were willing to use precious magic, they should at least not kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stepping knights followed Tiramisu and ran outside the base. There were also two valuable prisoners, a sealed knight who could not move. And the priest who was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Step Knights began to clean up the battlefield, take stock of the results, and search for enemies that might be hiding. More than a dozen soldiers fled across the wall at the last moment of the battle, and the Elf Oral had already chased it. He couldn't intercept all the escaping enemies, but only he still had some spare energy to chase after him. By the way, he made some explorations about the surrounding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is finally over. In the same way of grinding, the one side of Richard is not damaged, it is a miracle. The biggest creator of the miracle is actually sand. Her time mirror directly led to another powerful Jazz Huber being killed in the blink of an eye. Later, in the stalemate, she used seven powerful treatments, twelve treatments, and nearly 30 treatments. Injury is equivalent to adding more than half of life to everyone. A quick stream of sand is almost worthy of a small sect. In addition to her special talents and professions, the book of Time in her hands is also indispensable. Nearly one-third of the magic is stored in the book of Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of Richard, Gangde and Shuihua is unquestionable, almost equal. Gangde was entangled in Mintai, and Richard killed a large number of ordinary fighters. If he killed the number of kills, he is undoubtedly the first. Although there are only a dozen people who died under the water knife, they included five sealed knights, and the rest were almost all elite veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, in Richard’s calculations, the greatest contribution was actually the elf singer Oral. His combat singing effect can now bless three people, and the lifting effect is roughly equivalent to increasing from ten to eleven. It seems that there is not much improvement. However, in the long-term glue-like battle of the meat grinder, the singing sound runs through the whole battle, and the additive effect accumulated by its exertion is very considerable. Oral's own number of hunting is also close to ten. The Elf Archery is indeed good, and it avoids the sealed knights. It only looks for injured soldiers to attack, so it is often fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven stepping knights have survived. At this time, firm battle will and rich battlefield experience played a decisive role. In the early days of the ectopic war, the role of such a veteran was more important than what a young genius was. Until now, Gotton did not hesitate to consume the precious transmission position, and fully equipped the role of Richard with a full ten veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the superficial figures, Richard’s contribution to the war is far more than it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Soul Sensing, he is able to judge the current position and battle of nearly half of his comrades, thus appearing at the most critical position at the most critical moment. And at the beginning, the two ogres were ambushed, and when both sides became the end of the strong, they won the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard stood on the base square of the base and listened to the results of the battlefields reported by the knights. In the post-war post-war affairs, these veterans were extremely skilled, and did not even need to ask for more. In contrast, Gangde, Elf, Ogre and so on will only kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard listened and listened, and he was extremely sensitive to the numbers. He suddenly felt that the number of enemies was somewhat wrong. The escaping of the escaping and the dead are combined, and a total of a dozen people are missing. It is of course impossible for Richard to have an insight into what happened on the battlefield, but the difference in numbers is so great that it cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha searches his memory and finally judges that these more than ten disappearing warriors should not escape or hide in the base. Places, they should all become corpses. So the problem now is that these bodies have all disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has just ended, there should be no other enemies in the base, so where are these bodies going? Richard thought, suddenly felt a burst of headache. His ear always lingered with the shredded sound of the cymbal. He didn't think there was anything. He just thought that the background sound of the surrounding environment was now more and more clear and more surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stood up, pulled out the long knife inserted in the ground, and waved to indicate that the sand, the water and the Gangde kept up, following the senses. The direction of the voice went and soon came to a corner of the base. When I got here, the birthplace of the sound was very clear, and it was the bottom of the two-story building in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Brood?" Li called. In his consciousness, the nest is in this small building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the mother's nest immediately sounded in Richard's consciousness: "Master, I am here. There is no danger here, you can come in."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very fluent, the time of day has passed, and the mother's nest, as it is said, completely masters the lingua franca of Noland's mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s doubts, with everyone striding into the door, just as soon as he entered the door, Richard was shocked by the sight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom floor of the small building was originally a living room, now it is everywhere, all the furniture has become a pile of broken wood, a large space is cleared. . In the center of the living room, the mother's nest is swaying. It was lowering its head and constantly crunching the broken armor, shields and weapons, and the sound of the sound came from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is Richard, it is extremely shocking and unfamiliar to the mother's nest, which is two meters long and has a height and width of more than one meter. At the beginning of the battle, the mother's nest was only one meter in size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde and Shuihua subconsciously put on a stance, and the huge mother nest has given them a strong sense of danger. Although they have seen the mother's nest, and know that this is a kind of soul contract creature of Richard, but the one-meter-long mother nest and the terrorists in front of it are connected, but not everyone can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" Richard asked in shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
