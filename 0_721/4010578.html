			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary Hunter is just about to take another step forward and continue to oppress Alize, suddenly a huge pressure came down from the sky and fell on him. This pressure is as heavy as a mountain. There is also a chill of the Jin Ge Iron Horse, which instantly makes the Sanctuary hunter's body become heavy and stiff. That step did not go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famous knight with a variety of radiant radiance, standing silently behind Ellie, set up a rigorous formation, they are all locked The sacred hunter of the Eternal Night Elf can launch a fatal blow at any time. The construction of the Knight of this watch has been through the battlefield. Everyone is killed by blood and the whole strength is already naked. The worst is at least 16th level. The actual combat experience is extremely rich. With such a knight, there are two players who can compete with the Sanctuary hunter. Three have the hope of winning. If the five are, the Sanctuary Hunter will If you run away, you can't run slow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are contradictions between the knights and the generals of Alize, but they admire the ability of Ellie’s leadership, not to mention in their eyes, Alize is nothing more than the core of Archimonde, and the Eternal Night Elves are just the indigenous people of the secondary plane. Seeing that Ellie was bullied, all the knights did not do it right now, but here More than 300 knights are assembled, and the three Yongye tribes can kill the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred hunter was tied up with hands and feet at this moment, his face was swollen and red, and he roared: "This is the land of the Yongye tribe." "You, the intruders, are going back to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this scream of shaking the earth, the Sanctuary hunter emits a layer of halo, Actually, the lock of many knights was put on the line. Behind him, a huge elf shadow of several meters high suddenly appeared. The arrow was opened and an illusory long arrow had pointed to Ellie, the elf. As soon as the virtual shadow came out, all the knights were like being poured with ice and water. In a flash, the chill was very prosperous. Obviously, although this arrow is only a shadow, the lethality is terrible, no less than the stronghold of Nolande. The full blow of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Sanctuary of the Eternal Night Elf and the Holy Land of Noland, the whole set was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four barrier knights immediately stepped forward to block Alice, and there was a pale yellow light on the heavy shield. Every barrier knight could Taking the full force of the Sanctuary strong, and the four are tied, it is possible to protect all the colleagues behind him. In the self-constructed knight of Richard, the proportion of the wild barrier is much higher than that of the outfit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slayer's face changed slightly, but still not reconciled, screaming, the elf ghost changed for a while, but the image changed greatly. The long bow had more tangled twigs, and there were golden engraved runes and long arrows on the arrow. There are also dozens of power runes, and the elves themselves wear a layer of fine scales, and the momentum is even higher. This arrow is not a barrier to the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s eyes also ignited and raised his right hand sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her movements, many of the knights in the building are taking out throwing spears or sabre, as long as Ellie’s sword falls, let the tree be activated. The spear attack of the smashing of the sea will fall to the opposite night elf. Even the legendary strong will evade the spear and set the fire. If a sacred hunter in the area wants to block, it must be directly gray. It was him, even the group of eternal night elves behind him could not be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two great Druids and Melin of the Yongye tribe have arrived, but they are at a loss, so the situation, a little careless will lead to Both sides are offensive, they are not wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the little elf girl was finally scared, and wowed out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s look changed, and finally stared at the Sanctuary hunter and said coldly: “This time I’ve let you go, but you guys Remember, staying here now is like waiting for death. If you want to die, no one will stop you, but don't drag on other people. If you really have the skills, stand here and live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s said, Ellie’s sword is turned to the sheath, she turns and walks away, and she never looks at the night elf behind her. When she leaves, the knight’s costume knights also Just follow the stalk, until the last one built the knight turned, the Sanctuary Elf hunter took the huge hunter phantom, but his face became pale, suddenly spit out a blood, the breath suddenly fell to the bottom, Ellie When he walks away, he has to go to the other side to turn around and dare to converge on the momentum. It means that he is in a disadvantageous position in the confrontation. At this time, his heart is loose, and he can no longer suppress the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great Druids silently treated the slayer hunter, and the rest of the eternal night elves spread out, but everyone’s face There is a layer of shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the knights back to their posts, rehabilitating the wounds, sending out the whistle, everything is in order, but they and the Yongye elves naturally maintain a distance, Sheng The invaders of the domain hunter rolled back, and they were really happy, but they immediately opened the gap between the two sides. Especially in the previous battles, there was almost no damage to the Eternal Night Elf, but the knights were wounded but many were wounded. More than a dozen rides died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard didn't know that there was such a serious conflict between his own knights and the night elves. He thought that the two sides were only indifferent. In fact, there are few races that can maintain good relations with the high elves. Born out of the Silver Moon Elf, naturally, it inherits the arrogance of many Silver Moon elves. Even if it is actually protected by Richard, some of the upper-level night elves will still unconsciously treat the Knights under Richard's command with a condescending attitude. They are the same for the underlying elves in their own tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard is running in the forest, the forest will shield the soul connection between him and his followers, but has no effect on Richard’s own strength. Soon, Richard found his goal, a hidden proverb hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter was squatting in the canopy, holding his breath to monitor the movements around him, but he did not realize that Richard was standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the shoulder of the hunter and asked, "You are a proverb tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter has a lot of experience, this is also scared to the sky, not too careful, and rushed to the front with all strength, the result hit a big branch, screaming, he continued After breaking seven or eight thick branches, the momentum was exhausted, and he stunned and slammed on the ground. When he struggled to get up, he saw Richard stand in front of him and said in a light way: "Go to the tribes in your tribe." The elders called out, I have something to talk to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the hunter flew away, on the way to the rush, he still wanted I don't understand how I was close to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a half-day, in an open space in Linhai, Richard saw the people he wanted to see, the elders of two proverbs and a uniform Different young elf powers, this young elf is not old enough, but the strength is very strong. It is only a little worse than the forest son that Richard had killed, but his breath is different from the ordinary forest son. More profound and far-reaching, if the strength of the law contained in it is far above the ordinary life tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded to the young elf and asked, "This is a tribe from the world tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young forest son proudly said: "Yes, I am the fan of the Emerald Leaf tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elder elves said: "The elders of the proverb", "The proverb elder Guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee in accordance with the etiquette of the guardian elves, Said: "I am Richard, the owner of the current plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proverbs Guardian Guardian said coldly: "I am willing to take us alone." Come out, your courage is really not small, let's talk, there is something to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first glanced at the proverb elder, this There is a vague and strange feeling in the old man. It seems that there is something hidden under the appearance of the elf. It is very strange that the proverb elder has not introduced his name and does not seem to introduce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Richard smiled at Elder Guard and said, "If you are talking about the forty-one hunters and six Druids around, I I don't think I will be in danger. This time, I came for the things of the Everlasting Tribe. The Everlasting Elders entrusted the entire tribe to me before the death, and I didn't want the Yongye tribe to change the territory. I think this war can be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ending the war, it’s up to you." When Gard sneered and wanted to continue to ridicule, But when the elders of the proverbs stopped their eyes, they asked with anger: "Since you say that this war can end, there are always conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time came, Richard had already thought about it. Now he said, "It is very simple. In the future, the slang and the tribes of your alliance, including the emerald leaf tribe of the world tree, will be recognized by me. I will open up in the forest in the future. When you are in the territory, you will turn to the direction opposite the world tree. Maybe in the future, we may have The opportunity to make."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian is not angry and laughs, asks: "Just these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard frowned slightly and said, "That's all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian sneered: "If we kill you here, do you have no chance to say this?" Big talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "Even if I am dead, the plane portal is still there, and my army will continue to enter the green forest. One day, you can flatten the entire forest, just late or early, and certainly won't let you wait too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
