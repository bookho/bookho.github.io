			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two temples are separated by the main hall, if the hall is quiet Luno’s voice can even be passed to Richard’s ear. The big builder and the big magician used magic to boost their volume. But just as he began to attack the so-called genius, Richard had finished his short opening speech and began to show his new structure: the initial power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard lifted the frame and showed it, there was a magnified holographic image of the structure on both sides of the booth, which was still spinning. Let the person standing behind you see it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see this structure, the following people talk about it immediately, not because of anything else, but because the structure is too ordinary, too It is common. Many of the great mentors who are not the builders are likely to draw the primary power of the standard version. Although the layout of this structure in the hands of Richard is different from the standard version, the primary strength is the primary strength, and no matter how to play the trick, it will not be rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not a primary strength? Is my eye spent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, You are not mistaken! This is the primary strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Primary strength is also good to be released on this occasion?" This is an exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others meditated and said very deeply: "This primary strength is likely to have a unique and outstanding position. In my opinion, this is a Can be used as the primary power of the composite structure! Or it also comes with the effect of the attribute attack, you see, the bottom right corner is a brand new magic array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is ashamed, if used as a composite structure, or with a property attack, then this primary power can indeed be compared with the second-order structure, even more precious. The release of Richard here is also a matter of course. Just as everyone sighed, Richard began to introduce the function of this structure: "As you can see, this is a preliminary power. It can increase the target strength by 39%...."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the introduction of Richard, people are more and more surprised. Once again, people are surprised not because of the magic of this structure, but on the contrary, because of its ordinary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of 39% is completely excellent and has already approached the level of second-order power. It does not require high bearing capacity, and it is also an advantage, but it has not yet reached the level that can be a composite structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard put the structure down, many people still can't believe he has already finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard took out the second frame and once again attracted everyone’s attention. However, this time, people were surprised to see the initial defense, an equally common road! Well, although ordinary, it can't be said to be the way of the road, because the performance of the sub-assembly is still the ordinary primary defense, but it is not the standard version, or a few more magic lines. The little magical squad can't tell what the effect is, only to see that it is similar to the initial power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a personal style of Richard? People who are agile are thinking. It is no secret that Richard has an elf lineage, and the elf's nature is the pursuit of perfection, and loves the delicate and complicated artistic style. Perhaps the magical array only adds some decoration, or the place where the builder shows his personal style, just like the signature on the famous painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two structures that Richard took out were not famous paintings, and they were far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Luno finally finished a lengthy speech at the west side of the hall, indicating that Vonster could start his own press conference. Luno was not a famous person in speech. The words on weekdays are very simple, but today he has been so eloquently speaking for a long time. On the one hand, he expresses his pride in his new construction. On the other hand, he may have received Li. The stimuli of the investigation, talked about the transformation between genius and liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following listeners are not impatient, but they are all looking at each other and passing on the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonster has listened to the followers who said that the two structures that Richard has just shown are only primary strength and primary defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vonster boarded the high platform, someone immediately asked Vonster about the two configurations that Richard had just released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonster floats on himself as the most fascinating smile, and the clear voice resounds throughout the audience under the influence of magic. He said: "Although the structure and standard version of the two structures are very different, the attribute class looks only at the additive amplitude and carrying capacity requirements. How does the structure change, if not on these two indicators? Qualified, it is useless, it is just a gimmick! In the world of architecture, you want to climb a higher level of mountain, in addition to the necessary talent, you can only rely on down-to-earth, step by step! In this regard, the respected master Luno has just said that there is no such thing as a genius in the world of construction. Too many so-called geniuses stop in the second-order construction, and there is no inch in life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster takes out a frame, this piece is beautifully crafted, and has a lot of gorgeous decorations on the corners. The back of the plug has the coat of arms of the League Royals. In the corner, the full name of Fengster was signed. At the same time, a huge magic hologram appeared on the high platform, which magnified the structure hundreds of times, which can be seen by people in the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every gentleman, ladies, you see, this is one of the two structures I want to release today, second-order power. First, It has a property bonus of up to 43%! From this point, we can see the essential difference between the second-order power and the first-order power. A first-order construction, how beautiful it is made, and it is impossible to surpass the second order. Construction. Even if it is a 1% gap, it is also a far cry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following people talk a lot, mostly agree with Vonster's remarks. In terms of attribute construction, the bonus range is the first. The second-order structure addition amplitude can theoretically reach 50%, but the corresponding requirement is to increase the bearing capacity several times. As for Richard, he was able to simulate the second-order construction effect with the first-order structure, and he looked at the whole continent, and there were not many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the exhibition on the side of Richard has not been greatly affected and is still proceeding step by step. The primary defense he had just produced was also better than the standard standard, but it only achieved excellent standards and was not as shocking as his previous work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the big magician who really understood the audience frowned and began to think hard. Their eyes are sharp, and they have already discovered that Richard's two constructions are accurate and shocking! It stands to reason that there should be no such bonus. Are the seemingly useless magic arrays useful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard took out the third ‘vigor’, the people below had a little spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
