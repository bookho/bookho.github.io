Although there is no additional magical ban in the room, but nothing happens, Qi Qi will not set foot here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a small cabinet sealed with a magical array and draw a roll of magic paper from inside to reach out and stroke a specific magic. The seal on the scroll cast in his palm shines brightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha handed the reel to Qi Qi and said, "This is for you to learn to burn it, don't use magical fire to use natural fire"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&;珞珞Opened the reel and just snorted and exclaimed: "Dark Blue Fantasy"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "Yes, from now on, you also Count The master of the dark blue veins ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 clenched the look of the scrolls and said something complicated: "You...you remember this thing"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shrugged and said, "Why don't I promise you anything I will do"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪The head said slightly: "But I have nothing to repay you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha said with a smile: "You have helped me a lot. The drawings are not cheap. I haven’t paid for it yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi sighed: “The one that you gave me is brand new. The future is freedom. This is not something that can be measured with gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and twisted Qi Qi’s face and said, "You are going to talk more and more." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just telling the truth", Qi Qi suddenly smiles and reveals a pure and feminine style. Two very different qualities are combined in her body. Nothing to do when When she likes it, she does have the capital to kill the country.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard snorted and said, "I just boasted that you are proud of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else can I do for you?" The eyes are getting brighter and brighter<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seriously considered it and said, "Hurry up and upgrade is to help me"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is helping me. I think you are tired now and should relax." Qi Qi bites her lower lip and whispers <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the singer, he walked over to Richard and pushed him to force him. He was unprepared and took two steps back to the wall. The body that 珞 散 散 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经 已经跪 at the feet<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing the sound of the clothes of Sosuo, Qi Qi found the target with a bite and swallowed it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's whole body trembled first, sucking a cold breath and then making a beast-like hoarseness. He almost directly confessed to Qi Qi’s small mouth. Richard hurriedly held down the head of Qi Qi to give himself a line of asthma. Then the machine angered: "You have specially trained"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 forcefully spit out obstacles so that she can talk and look up at Richard’s face: "Does this still require training? If you have enough care, you can't take the opportunity to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 opened the hand of Richard and is a set The sinister bite and swallowing is repeated. Richard only feels that there are thousands of knights who are slamming their defenses and then sturdy defenses. Under such an offensive, they become fragile and simply collapse.<br /> Br /> </ br> </ br> The French spoke but still raised his hand and made a victory gesture to Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was furious and took a deep breath and rushed to the top of the hot fire. The power of the Hydra lizard emerged from all over the body again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 only feels that the mouth has gradually Weak guy suddenly furious scalding hot and almost put her mouth bursting of the rack <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Qi Qi exclaimed that the weapon had been violently pumped out and then she was smashed up in the air and flew in the air and then pressed firmly on the table<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei held one hand and held her waist. With the familiarity of her clothes, she only disarmed her with one hand. When the full hip circle of the Qiqi came out, Richard could not wait. The hole pierced her<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the situation between the two people was completely reversed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact was fast and there was no room for it. Every time it crashed, Qi Qi seemed to fall into the bottomless abyss and screamed only helplessly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the two, Qi Qi has completely fallen into the next is endless torture. Richard has long noticed her changes, but even more chasing and killing, Qi Qi has nowhere to escape, but only pleads for mercy in accordance with Richard’s request.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Qi Qi immediately found that begging for mercy was also scorned and not begging for mercy. Keeping her promise, she rises to the final strength and accuses Richard of his words without trust. However, it is a more violent repression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is quiet The sweat of two people passed by with the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Qi Qi was unable to fall on the floor and Richard also lay down two people by her side. They are all breathing hard like a pair of fish being thrown ashore<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 was killed at the beginning but it was still in the end. It’s a sigh of relief until it’s fading until the seven drums are exhausted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not easy enough to calm down and say: “This is not relaxing.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qifu refused to move the bullet to give him a curvy naked back and said lazy: "There is no second half is not relaxing"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and said, "How could there be no second half?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪笑笑 "That can't blame me"<br / ><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rest for a while, I will recover my physical strength and take a shower. I only feel that my breath is comfortable, and I just got out of the bath. I don’t have a style that is very clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While wearing clothes, Richard said to Qi Qi: "Well, don't meditate and draw the structure now, relax and just look at my work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to work, Qi Qi immediately frowned and said: "No, I still have a lot of constructions that have not been fixed. Now only four have been fixed"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the elimination of Raymond’s army, Richard recovered a total of thirty-five pieces of repaired value, of which twenty second-order structures were <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qi Qi's current level of construction is enough to repair the fifteen first-order structures, but the build-up bonus of her hand will be reduced. This is also a common problem for all repairs.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard can guarantee that the repairing performance of the repair is not degraded or even improved by attaching additional functional modules to the structure and changing the structure of the structure. However, it is better to use that time. To create higher-level non-standard components, such as life-threatening and magical armed forces, only to repair second-order or higher It’s worthwhile for Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi dragged the tired and sore body and quickly prepared all the tools for drawing the structure for Richard but heard Li She checked out the material and she thought that Richard was trying to repair those second-order structures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard personally polished the magic material and poured it into it. In the magical pen of the artifact, the attitude of Richard once worked is extraordinarily serious. The whole person slowly calms down and advances into the state of full concentration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the start of the work He didn’t raise his head and said, "You have also fixed those second-order structures together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪心一急急: "I can't do it." The success rate is less than half""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's nothing but a standard second-order structure. You can easily recycle five if you qualify." Said to outline the first pen on the substrate<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi did not dare to speak again, but breathlessly looked at Richard’s movement I am afraid that I missed even the tiniest details.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power of the radiant magic that began to shine on the body was constantly mobilized and injected into the magic pen and mixed with the pigment to stimulate Out of their different characteristics and then etched on the substrate<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just looking at a few pens, Qi Qi held her breath subconsciously. She felt that there was a faint murder and began to emanate from the structure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Life is absolutely 珞”珞Qi whispers <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she has seen Richard draw life. Absolutely a builder can see such rare structures with his own eyes. The drawing is definitely an opportunity that can be met and not available.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset rises from the fingertips, and after seven days, it is a life that is completely finished.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of Richard’s energy has been exhausted. After the final stroke, he will fall down and start to sleep. Qi Qi must have to meditate once a day to be able to support it. She couldn’t stand the sleep after she finished it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Richard woke up to eat a full complement of physical strength and began to draw a second life. However, this time it was not very smooth. On the third day, the unfinished structure of the flames on the workbench suddenly disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was wrinkled and frowned, and the workbench was cleaned up and then the new drawing was started. This time it only lasted for half a day and it failed. However, as early as in the learning stage, Richard had become accustomed to various failures and did not move silently to start new. Attempt<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another six days, Richard completed the second painting of life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the completion, Richard felt that he was still spared. In the next ten days, he appeared in his pen with two sets of wild barriers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hundred enchantments of the time hen’s nest have been produced. According to Richard’s special requirements, the magical riding is not only the upper limit of life has been raised to fifteen years and the attributes are strengthened than the original samples, especially the endurance part. The magic ride can run four hours in a small step under full weight load, which is twice that of a normal framed ride.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the requirements of the indicators are greatly increased, With the help of the nest, the nest can only create three heads of magic every day. The quality of the special magic ride has been much higher than that required by Philip. It is not a problem to sell 160,000,000. However, Richard is still only preparing to charge 120,000. The most direct way to increase trust is to increase trust.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
