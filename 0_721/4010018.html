			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blame, or even blame, can’t really damage Gordon Root hair. No one has made a particularly aggressive action. Gordon’s strength is becoming unfathomable. Not many people know what kind of realm his fighting power has. However, Modred, who stood silently behind Gordon, has the title of the devil, and the pressure is strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! In the chaos, a red robe man picked up his staff and banged hard on the table of the conference table, finally letting everyone calm down a little. He stood up and looked around for a week, solemnly saying: "In view of the fact that the Marquis of Gordon used the resources of the whole nation for a meaningless war, I propose to remove the position of the Marquis of Marquis of Marques, Akman, 7-2 The floating island is managed by the family council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also agree ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old robe of the red robe has just fallen, and the voices in the conference room are on the rise. At least seven or eight people have agreed to raise their hands, which is close to half. Several people hesitated and raised their hands. As a result, the number of people who have been seconded has been more than half. According to the newly-developed family council agenda in recent years, the resolution has passed and has been effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few small lords who have been seconded, and many of the strengths within the Archimonde have not spoken. For example, the representative of the Marquis of Sauron is only holding his chin and seems to be thinking. The Earl of Goliath leaned against the back of the chair to keep his eyes closed, while the Earl of Alice had repaired his nails with a sword that was close to the artifact level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon finally had some reaction. He opened his eyes and glanced at the old Master of Red Robe. His face was ridiculously mocking, slamming, one bite. Thick squirting on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old robe of the red robe has a green face, and Gordon’s swearing is no doubt equivalent to spitting on his face. He was extremely angry, and the staff used his force to hit the table and shouted: "The Marquis of Gordon! Pay attention to your words and deeds! You are no longer the patriarch of Archimonde. We don't need one for ourselves." Consider the patriarch! Now, all your rights related to the patriarch, including this black rose castle, should be handed over to the family council!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon seems Didn't hear the roar of the old mage, just lazily said: "Glass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood paladin Semma immediately handed over a staggeringly high The foot cup has a full half bottle of red wine. Gordon shook his goblet. Although the size of the container was wrong, his gestures were elegant and skilled, and the swaying liquid scented the fragrance, which was a professional wine tasting technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old red robe is even more angry, which is simply a second insult to him. He just wanted to express his speech in an impassioned manner. The red wine glass in Gordon's hand suddenly appeared in front of him. His bang blew on his face, and the huge impact made him fly backwards. He fell to the ground with great embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master struggled to stand up, his face mixed with blood and red wine, sloping down. He held his trembling fingers to Gordon, his lips groaning, but he could not speak. Then the old master shook and swayed again. I couldn’t climb anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon shocked the audience, and everyone’s eyes focused on him. He took his legs back from the table, stood up, scanned the audience, and said coldly: "The patriarch of Archimonde has always been played out! When did it become elected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s thunderous voice echoed in the conference hall, and no one responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon knocked on the table and sneered and said, "I don’t care what you guys think, but what family council is coming from, since Laozi’s patriarch is playing, so who wants to be the patriarch and live in this black rose castle, I have to use my fist to drive me out! Now, tell me, who wants to be the patriarch?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes fell on the representative of the Marquis of Sauron and said, “My uncle, the Marquis of Sauron has this intention?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the Marquis of Soren is the young Baron of Suya and the youngest son of the Marquis. The young man who had just turned 20 was not flustered under Gorton’s temptation. He even did not shake his posture with one hand. He said calmly: “My father told me that this time I just have to look at the fun. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerton flashed a glimpse of the eye, nodded and said: "Yes, it seems that Sauron gave birth to a good son." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Suya smiled and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes fell on Goliath: “My dear brother, what do you mean?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorge, with a huge body, laughed and said, "I have to make a few more territories and a new private plane. After I change my title into a Marquis, I will consider whether it is good with you. Take a nap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon nodded and finally looked at Ellie. He didn't say anything, and Ellie opened his right hand and shook it to Gordon. He said, "The five knights can buy me. Don't take the first step to fool me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon touched his beard and laughed and said: "Buy? Why should I buy you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have gone out of the nest this time. If you don't get the old nest, you will be copied. If Richard suddenly comes back, I can be his protector. Just five knights!" Elliott's right hand Shaking in front of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smiled and said: "There are a lot of people who want to kill the kid. If Laozi is not there, do you dare to pick him up?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice started to trim the nails again and again, faintly said: "Is there anything I dare? So far, the guy who has played with me has not regretted it. As for some of the waste in this room, not to mention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever dares to say me, I will think it is a war statement, and I will fight tomorrow." "I don't die!" Ellie's voice was not loud, but it suppressed all the noise and showed extraordinary strength. And all the snoring sounds almost instantly silenced, and everyone present knows that Alice said that he would do it and immediately quieted down. It’s true that you have a good mouth at the meeting, but if you have a war, it’s not fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon put everything in his eyes, so he said, "The meeting ends here! I decided that the war will continue as usual! Also, the parliament will be dissolved immediately. Don't let me hear something similar again. The family elders will maintain the rules of the family. The family rules are those who have a big fist and have a black rose castle. If you want to be an elder, you can speak with strength, even if you don’t have eldership. Again, as for the rest, you are free. You want to stay and play for a few more days, but all costs are self-care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Gordon left the conference hall. A group of Archimondes in the conference hall talked a lot, and the old master of the red robe was also helped to leave. He is only a big magician of the 14th level, and he is not a strong guy in the dark blue. Where can he stand up with Gordon? Until the end, I could not afford to walk on my own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first family council of the Archimonde family ended in violence, envy, intimidation and threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone stood up until the man walked almost, lazily stretched out and walked out. The Baron of Sua did not leave first, and a pair of shining eyes never left Elliot. Seeing that Ellie was ready to leave, he strode up and smiled and said, "Beautiful County Ellie, can I have the honor to have dinner with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Alice looked at Suya with interest, and the red short hair was like a flying flame, which filled her with blazing beauty. Suya is also very good. At a young age, he has made achievements in the plane war. The fifteenth-level personal force fully demonstrates the talent. Although he is not particularly shocking, but it is commendable that there is no obvious shortcoming in each item. And he is handsome, but also has the natural pride and staunchness of Archimonde. On many occasions, this temperament has a deadly appeal to girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dinner is just the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! If there is further possibility, of course I Will not give up." Su Ya admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Companion?" Ellie asked very red/naked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, marriage!" Suya is very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice smiled and said, "But you and I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flash of light in Suya’s eyes flashed, and Shen Sheng said: “We will become comrades fighting side by side, partners who work together, and partners who live and die together. As for love, it is only an embellishment in this process. Passion is like a volcano, after eruption There is only cold ash left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice laughs: "A ambition! Ha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Or an authentic pervert!" Suya added. He stared at Ellie, full of blazing beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice shook her head and said, "I know your mind very clearly, why bother it so much? I am actually very simple and very good. Soak. Simply say, accompany dinner to two knights, kiss five knights, touch seven, go to bed ten, partner twenty. Still, don't take the first step to fool me. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, is my price unclear?" Ellie asked questioningly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, no, not... this, let me think..." The boy of Suya is incoherent. In any case, he couldn’t think of it as such a scene, and even the wording was hard to find. Now he only understands what Ali is like in the past. This young and beautiful woman can always be unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya really believes that Ellie will be the ideal partner, and Ellie sees this. Suya has no doubt that Ellie will honor her. As long as he can get a knight, then Alice will accompany her as she promised, even when her partner has children, so he will not know. Measures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
