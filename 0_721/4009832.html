			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded and reached out and pointed to Richard and himself. A little divine power did not enter the two bodies, so the various breaths scattered outside all converge, as long as careful not to make a sound, it is difficult for the scouts of the old road to find them. The sand drifts and casts a magical technique that blends into nature. This is the goddess of the forest goddess and Druid. Under this effect, the creatures can be perfectly integrated with nature, even if they encounter trees and leaves. The sound is no different from the natural sound of the wind blowing through the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently, the sand shows itself a little special. However, Richard did not touch the pastor of the Eternal and Time Dragon, and he did not feel strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and the sand flow merged with the forest under the night, quietly sneaking in the direction of Oral. Because there is a magic contract between the two sides, the position of the elf bard is not at all Richard. Just a few minutes ago, the elf moved to a certain place in the forest and no longer moved. Richard first felt strange and faintly felt what might happen, so hesitated to stay close. However, his feet slowed down, and the sand that followed closely behind him stuck up, his light breath blowing into his neck, and gently pushing his back with his hand, urging him to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand can not feel the movement of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the foothills, the wind in the night is very big, whizzing through the forest, there is something, and it is covered up by the wind. However, in the middle of the night, Richard felt that the atmosphere seemed to have changed a bit, and he couldn’t tell. The feeling of touch with the sand is also very clear. The body of the quicksand once again appeared in the mind, and how can it not drive away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet did not go deep into the forest, so Richard and quicksand were also very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the wind, a strange sound has been sent, except for Oral, there are other people’s voices. Li slowly pressed down the dense shrubs of the former shrubs, and the probe looked away. Just over a dozen meters away, the elf bard was holding a woman tightly, slamming her body fiercely and singly. In her ear, she whispered in love. The woman leaned against a big tree, her arms wrapped around the elf poet's neck, and her legs were twisted on the elf's waist. The whole person, except for the big tree, borrowed a little force and was completely hung on the elf. She is in a state of extreme excitement, and her voice is louder than a scream. The elf quickly reminded her of her, so the woman lowered her head and buried it in the shoulder and neck of the elf. Then she bit the shoulder of the elf and made a sob of the throat, like crying like joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is obviously stimulated, the action is more fierce, the woman’s body immediately begins to violently twitch, and the white dazzling legs under the night are repeatedly coiled and twisted. tight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Richard cursed lowly. He didn't expect to see these things. If he didn't mind, he wouldn't mind enjoying it for a while, but now the sand is behind him. How do you look at it? And if only Richard is alone, then you can look at it very calmly, plus a quicksand can be different, at least Richard began to have some control over his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate is that the sands have now slid onto the back of Richard, looking forward from the probe on his shoulder, just to see the crazy scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Oral and that...well, the jazz mistress. What are they doing?...Oh, I understand.” The sand is slightly hoarse The voice rang in the ear of Richard, and his control of the body was on the verge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melee of the elves and the women is still going on, and the intensity is beyond imagination. It seems that his physical strength is much stronger than that shown by Junmei's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally couldn’t stand the double suffering of sight and body, and he was ready to stand up and drink the elves. The reason is actually very easy to find, and the captives are not free to use, at least the elves can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sand seems to feel the action of Richard, and the body on his back suddenly fell heavily, holding down Richard, whispering: Don't move, keep watching. I haven't seen it before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard finally couldn’t control the reaction of the body, and the male symbol instantly rose to the limit. He was furious and grabbed the sand chest with his backhand and slammed it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is just a sigh, I know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf and the woman’s body are trembled violently, apparently climbing to the highest peak of happiness. However, their time spent on the summit is extraordinarily long. It seems that the bard is not only talented, but also has undergone special and rigorous training to have such a strong fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they were forgotten, Richard felt extra hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s impact stopped, and the woman was already soft and soft, hanging on the elf. They simply sorted out their clothes and left in a hurry. Along the way, you can also hear the promise of the poet's vague love and poetry. Only those promises can be honored with a few words, but no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee and the quicksand remain in the same position, motionless. The spree of the Elf Bard has ended, and the perception will definitely return to the usual level. He was a good scout, and once he discovered Richard and quicksand, he was paralyzed. At the beginning, Richard did not stand up and drink, but now he can't even let him see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Oral walked away and the forest calmed down again, Richard suddenly grabbed the sand, pressed her to the ground, and then held her god The neckline of the robe was forced to pull down, and the whole robe was faded to the waist, leaving most of her upper body completely exposed. The two points of amber are slightly transparent, and once again, the blood is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the teeth, Richard, the sand reaches out, gently pinching Richard’s arm, faintly said: “If you eat me, you can’t spit it out. Go, you have to think clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Is the cleric of the eternal dragon temple kept pure?" Richard asked, that only slightly The cool little hand was pinched slightly on the arm that he was squeezing, and the blood was rushing over the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the Eternal Dragon Temple does not have this requirement. But I can tell you for sure, eating it will be a very troublesome thing, than you expected." I still have trouble. At the same time, I am also a very troublesome person, if you look at me as a woman, but if you just think of me as a pastor partner you can rely on, you will never be disappointed and will not have trouble. I will help you solve a lot of troubles." Flowing sand this time is quite rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s response was to completely smash the hem of the sand robes, leaving her legs bare and occupying the final attack. Then I said, "You are provoking! I am not a person who will be afraid of trouble, and in order to prove this, it seems that eating you is the only choice. I don't know if I can return to Noland, so The troubles of the future are not considered necessary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
