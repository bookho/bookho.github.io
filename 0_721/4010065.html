			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Richard called the quicksand and said: I found a strange thing in the family castle, I feel that it should be a sacrifice, but I am not sure. You ask a few priests to come and identify it. If you can use it for sacrifice, use it directly."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to be cheaper?" asked the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The benefit is always that you are occupied, go!" If there were still a few priests watching, Richard had already slapped the sand. The ass is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted away and returned to the temple after a while, followed by Nolan’s great official and Ferdinand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group followed Richard back to the floating island and went straight to the top floor of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where Gordon usually meditates, the skull of the beasted animal is still quietly placed there. At the moment of seeing it, everyone could not help but chill. Richard has seen it a few times and is ready. However, Nolan and Ferdinand even involuntarily retreat a half step, which is no ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan carefully looked at the material wrapped in the skull of the star beast, and exclaimed a moment: "This is a forbidden woven cloth! A legendary item that can completely isolate the space." What is it inside, what do you need to wear woven woven fabrics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take a look." Ferdinand took a step forward and took up the temper to protect the whole body. Only carefully picked up the corner of the forbidden woven fabric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand’s temperament is hot and red, and when it comes to the extreme, it’s already in essence, like a piece of bright red crystal floating around the body. When the enchanted woven fabric opened a gap, it revealed a blue skin with a piece of crystal-like scales. Inside the translucent nails, there is a piece of continental image floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan glanced at him, his body trembled, and suddenly thought of one thing, immediately screamed with all his strength: "Don't open!!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was already a little late, and the forbidden woven fabric was pulled a little further, so a blue-blue eyeball appeared in the line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand's reaction speed was unparalleled, and the sound immediately released the fabric in his hand and immediately retreated. But it was already late, and his body was suddenly painted with a layer of blue, and then disappeared silently. His left arm is also blue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand screamed and quit ten meters in an instant, but the others returned and the entire left arm stayed in place! The arm, whether arm, clothes or arm, was soaked in the blue from the inside out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, just in front of Richard and others, the arm suddenly burst open, turning into a starry sky, falling slowly, like a dream. However, the hearts of all people are suddenly chilly, and they are lost for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the head of the star beast!" Nolan's voice was shaking, and the trembling came from the horror that passed away with death. Although she is a great priest, it is precisely because of this that she cherishes life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, when Ferdinand retreated, he also controlled the vindictive release in time, and the smashed woven fabric fell safely, covering the eyes of the star beast. Otherwise, I am afraid that what he lost is not just an arm. His shoulders left a smooth and uncut face, and the wound was covered with a layer of light blue crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this thing appear here?" Nolan's great official was pale and his heart was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in Noland, the star beast is very powerful. Every time a star beast invades, if it is handled improperly, it may lead to a small-scale disaster. Even if you die, as long as your eyes are still intact, the star gaze of the star beast is equally powerful. And the whole body part of the star beast, the most difficult to destroy is the eyeball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is also very ugly, saying: "This was sent by my teacher not long ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness? No wonder." When mentioning the legendary Master, Nolan also emerged the color of worship. This star beast skull is enough to prove the power of the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferdinand’s face reveals a layer of pale gold, but the voice is still relatively stable, saying, “Sorry, I think I have to rush back to the Eternal Dragon Hall because The wound needs to be treated immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Ferdinand flew straight out of the window and flickered in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at the head of the star beast again and looked complicated. He said, "Richard, the head of this star beast, I am afraid that Vatican’s great deity must come personally. To determine the value, I can only bring it back to the Eternal Dragon Hall. But I can be sure that its value must have exceeded the standard of high-level sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Yes. I only have one request. The sacrifice ceremony is presided over by Liusha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, even Nolan Exuding the meaning of envy, and then said: "Okay, I must pass your request to the Vatican Grand God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsand smiles, regardless of Nolan was on the side, kissed directly on Richard's lips, and then left after Nolan. Nolan directly mentioned the star animal's head and left the window. He also smashed the sand, and inadvertently showed the powerful strength of the eternal dragon temple officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the flow of sand and Nolan, all the things that Richard had finished were basically finished. The rest is waiting, waiting for the necessary supplies and trading goods in place. Originally, this kind of free time, Richard will be used to make the structure, because the process of drawing the structure is also helpful for the growth of magic. Or can be used for meditation, Richard has just become a 12-level magician, there is too much room for improvement, how can not be overworked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before leaving, Richard suddenly raised a question: What is this floor used for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, what Richard saw was just an empty space, nothing, not even the most basic decoration. In front of him is a floor-to-ceiling window with a full wall. No, to be precise, that should not be called a window, but directly remove the entire wall. Therefore, the huge star animal head can enter and exit from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no dividing wall or room in the whole floor, it is a huge space, it is very empty. When the original star beast was placed here, Richard’s attention would be involuntarily attracted to him. Now that the star beast has been taken away, he can see the whole picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floating island, there is no such thing as extravagance and enthusiasm. Why is the entire floor empty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee walked and walked through every corner of the floor. Finally, I found a slightly smooth place, which seems to be the traces that I often left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
