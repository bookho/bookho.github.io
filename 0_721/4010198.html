			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight stood quietly for a moment, when she opened her eyes again, There was a thick green drift in the depths of the pupil, and then it burned fiercely and turned into a thick red blood! She burst into a squeaky squeak around her body, her body was slightly longer and her breath increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯 lifted his right hand and looked at it. As her mind turned, a light red flame appeared on the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the eleventh level, the Green Sen Elf is really very good. Eat another fifty, twelve...150, 13... ... four hundred and fifty, fourteen..." The twilight is silently calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed the short knife inserted in her chest and slowly pulled the knife and threw it to the ground without looking. The wound on the chest did not flow out of a drop of blood, and immediately gathered, leaving only a faint scar after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red chest is full of dense bones and muscles, and the muscle itself has the function of storing energy. Any sharp edge penetrates, under the contraction of the muscles, the bones of special substances will lock the weapon that is pierced. Therefore, my heart is not her key, but a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolved the last one." The twilight sends a message. Then I walked in the direction of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the creation of the mother's nest, the soul link between Twilight and Richard is much stronger than the other contractors, similar to the soul guarding the water. When Richard's soul power is further enhanced, he can share his perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After converging the twilight and the splash, Richard took the stunned teenager Druid and walked outside the forest. All the elf warriors who came to the rescue were slain by splashes of water and ochre. I still don't know how long it will take for other elf warriors to come, but since I caught a live Druid, Richard didn't want to make extra money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people were very fast and quickly quit the forest. As long as you leave the forest, it is safe. Richard did not rush to return to the city, but waited for a while, and saw Agamemnon coming out of the forest, holding a staff with fresh green leaves in his hand. This is obviously the natural stick used by the Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For a moment, let him run, leaving only one arm and this thing." Agamemnon said with a wry smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha has been very surprised, and Agamemnon’s strength is probably stronger than he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a variety of special abilities, especially the natural blood of the elf and the structure of the forest, which makes him very beneficial in the environment of Green Forest, even More adapted than the Green Sen. Even so, the Druids turned into night leopards, and they were invisible. It took good luck to see their tracks. Originally, Richard was expected to have nothing to gain from Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is easy to get, just because luck is good enough, just caught the unqualified boy Druid in his hand. Agamemnon was able to find his opponent and left the other arm and a natural cane that was almost identical to the second life of Druid, which was shocking. And the latent sneak attack on Agamemnon certainly did not hold the striking sledgehammer, only brought a normal knight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the deep forest like a sea, and raised the young Druid in his hand and said, "Go back! Maybe tomorrow. The elves should have a big move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the city, Richard called Agamemnon and pointed to the still comatose Druid, saying, "This little guy has a hard mouth. I am afraid that my people can't ask anything. Or you too. Send a few people to come over and find a way to let him speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon took a deep look at Richard and nodded: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and handed the young Druid to Oral, then gave him a few words and went back to rest. Sitting in the damp forest for a night, this taste can be uncomfortable. At this time, it really made him grow moss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the city still opened the city gate, the three teams of soldiers sneak out and began routine logging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the team is still a humanoid elite knight, but their scarlet armor is not only painted with gold, but also a badge on the chest. It is a world tree with a volcano as its back. A look at this complex and gorgeous badge, radiant armor, fools can judge these elite knights are big people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has described this new pattern to Niris in an understatement. Because of his recent leisure time, he designed his own personal badge. So Nyris, who was so sullen and long, was attracted to his heart and was angry. Having a personal badge is the beginning of the independent creation of a family branch, and Richard's current strength does have this qualification, the only difference is the network and accumulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Four Emperors were sad, Agamemnon was also on the side, he was still expressionless, silent, just reaching out and licking Nyris’ hair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no one explicitly said it, Richard noticed that the badges on the two hundred bloody guards of Agamemnon were slightly abnormal. The silver-white shield badge with three golden fragrant irises is the family crest of the Duke of the Iron Blood. Each branch has its own nuances. For example, the personal emblem of the Iron Duke adds a horizontal cross. The sword, as well as the blood drops that replace the flower buds. But the bloody guards that followed Agamemnon were three fragrant roots and irises backed by a sky-blue wing shield, a pattern that had never appeared in the family of the Dukes of the Iron Age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers are still talking and laughing, and the morale is high. Richard and Agamemnon attacked late at night, catching one and seriously hurting a Druid's record, and let all the soldiers in the city gain confidence. It turns out that these indigenous people are nothing terrible. As Richard said, let us cut down these damn trees and cut them into their nests! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logging efficiency of this day is extra high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the walking forest still appears. Although both Richard and Agamemnon are resting leisurely and have no plans to attack, it is conceivable how tense the Druids will be. Because the trees that drive out tonight are not half as much as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only regret is that the young Druid refused to speak, the determination of the will, and even Richard was somewhat self-satisfied. Oral, who is good at torture, and the two guards under Nyres are helpless. The methods used are all used. The soul of the young Druid is wrapped in a group of green energy. This is the protection of the power of the Green Forest. It cannot be broken at all, so all the magical magic that affects the mind is invalid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a struggle, others began to come up with ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu felt that he could cook his left leg, and the twilight was seconded. Sher and other people are also very vocal, mostly proposals that are not creative, and not as deterrent as the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
