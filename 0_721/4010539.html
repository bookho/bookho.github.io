Stars can transport thousands of tons of rock wood to Noland in one go. Richard inquires about the use of combustion improver and knows that if more doses are used, rock and wood can be burned. It's faster, it's actually military. The soldiers usually only need to burn for one night, and they don't need to burn the rock for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a more amazing thing." The gray dwarf is a bit anxious to say, "The rock contains a lot of energy, if it is completely crushed, join Combustion agents, a certain amount of goblin fuel and a dozen other things, may create something that can produce a violent explosion, the power may be three times higher than the existing dwarf gunpowder, maybe five times, this is that The old elf said, I think he is going crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three to five times stronger than the dwarf gunpowder?" Richard stunned and began to calculate this fast. What it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf is still chattering: "I am worried now that the old guy will make a loud noise in the lab, and then send himself Going back to the embrace of the world tree, this thing sounds a bit dangerous, but the old thing may be to use more research resources. He actually wants 300,000 gold coins. I think he is not an elf, but he is going to become A gray dwarf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard’s mind has outlined what can be done under the new gunpowder, although it is only a rough blueprint. But he had already let him breathe a little, and immediately said, "Give him 500,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fifty thousand, I think 300,000 are false reports. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's 500,000, but be sure to tell him that I don't have that much patience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf muttered: "This lucky old thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li saw no other things The communication was cut off. At this time, his troops had been assembled in the Black Rose Castle by remote transmission. The leading troops began to enter the Green Forest. Before going to the Green Forest, Richard considered it and decided to go to the sacrifice. This time. At the sacrifice, Richard prepared two high-level sacrifices and several low-level sacrifices. The process of sacrifice was smooth. Perhaps the eternal and time-honored dragon felt that it was difficult to see the front, and this time it was extraordinarily loose. Richard successfully got the required plane channel enhancement, and it was three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of the altar, Richard is somewhat difficult to choose in the face of these three planes. In normal terms, the three reinforcements should be given to Faro, because it is the foundation of Richard, and the mother nest is also in Faro. A powerful plane channel means that the cost of large-scale mobilization of troops is greatly reduced. This is a true strategic investment. However, Faro has already produced a doomsday mark, which means that the plane has entered the path of destruction. At this time, any investment in Faro may be unwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated for a long time, suddenly biting his teeth and putting all three plane channel enhancements to Faro. He wanted to see and prepare to destroy. What exactly is Luo's, at least ten years, ten years is enough to produce miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a low-level sacrifice left, and when Richard puts it on the altar, he sees it broken down by the power of time. In the void, there are countless magnificent time sands. These sands will form the gods of Richard. When the sand is condensed together and the shape of a weapon has been outlined, the soul of Richard suddenly moves, hidden inside. The power of a little time shoots a light, and then the weapon that will be formed is broken and reduced into sand. When the sand flies in the air for a while, it finally gathers into a rapid stream, which is shot on the back of Richard’s hand and marks a time. The mark of the hourglass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new message is introduced into the consciousness of Richard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: the soul lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike previous gods, the Soul Lighthouse is actually a power that allows Richard to mark the soul of an enemy as long as both On the same plane, Richard can sense his position. This is an unparalleled ability to track. Although it can only be used once, it is enough to surprise Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the process of the sacrifice is a little weird, and Richard is ready to take a quasi-legendary item that is of no use, but he did not expect that the sand would suddenly be Dispelling, replaced with this extremely powerful one-off ability, at this time, a new message came, this is a capability attached to Richard's title rambler: fate interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intervention of fate can occasionally change the gift of sacrifice to make it more in line with the needs of Richard. When it works, what does Richard know? God's gift will become a god of the next level, even if this is what Richard is most wanting at the moment, it can be upgraded again, so the additional explanation after the intervention of fate is this: no best, only better This is the privilege of the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the final explanation, Richard knows the power of fate intervention. He looks at the symbolic imprint on the back of his hand. In an instant, he thinks of countless uses, such as positioning the world tree through the soul of the forest son, such as hunting for Shulan. The only trouble in the plane is the dragon star, and for example, the pursuit of vain... And if the soul lighthouse is re-advanced, if it can cross the obstacle of the plane, can it be used to find the sand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the mark on the back of his hand, and he was deeply impressed. He had sacrificed too many times and was quite familiar with the model of the Eternal and Time Dragon. This is actually a temptation to temptation to speed up the promotion of the title, that is to say, to make more sacrifices, at this time, Richard is involuntarily thinking of the attitude of many powerful people to the dragon of eternal and time. And the warning to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled a bit, not for anything else, but found that he is now in the stage of extreme eagerness for power, there is no capital to bargain, and the most powerful The quick way is to rely on sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has fixed his mind and walked out of the hall of sacrifice. Nolan has been waiting at the door, and she looks at her expression and knows that she is in a good mood now, not only from Li Observing the divine grace, and Richard finally fulfilled the promise and produced a fourth-order structure for Nolan: the power of the power, this building ability can be described as a law-abiding, can greatly improve the effect and duration of the magic, but This is another very powerful structure. The core lies in the large qualifiers. For example, the great priests of Nolan, the high-level magic is infinite. If there is any increase, the power can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan accompanied Richard until he sent him out of the Eternal Dragon Hall, and then found a time, whispered: "The things you want are already ready." Ok, I almost took out all that I could find. This is a whole 5,000 sets of equipment. Are you sure there are so many high-ranking knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He smiled and replied: "My knight, endless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a famous saying left before the founding emperor Charles the Great of the Holy Alliance expedition. When millions of troops entered the abyss, they looked at it infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan was also joking at the beginning, but looking at the back of Richard, I don’t know why, she suddenly felt that Richard said that At the time, it is likely to be serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard didn't know the thoughts of Nolan's mind. When he stepped into the portal to the Greenson plane, he couldn't reach the endless extent of the Cavaliers. However, he took a full hundred riders, plus Four hundred 黯 骑士 knights, this power is by no means negligible. More importantly, Richard also brought the avatar's avatar this time. This is the killing of the green forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon have arrived in Green Forest in advance, and after re-arranging the defense line at the forward base, they went to the base of the tree of life. Their mission is Guarding the tree of life, and practicing in the tree of life, can be more than half faster than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of the portal, Richard flashed aside and gave up the position in front of the portal. The soldiers who guarded the portal had already got orders and called out loud. The entire area in front of the portal is emptied, and the next big one is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment on the portal, a dark black conical head was found from inside, and then the star was like a giant snake, slowly from the portal. Swim out, on both sides of the body, you can see two rows of dark black shadow diamonds, which is the source of strength and evolution of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stars all swim out of the portal, they are already a monster with a diameter of several meters and a length of more than 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that the star has no fighting power, the base soldiers will be deeply shocked every time they see it. This is a huge deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the principal of the base, and after simply explaining the necessary matters, he left the base city with followers and stars and stepped into the 茫茫Lin Hai, only in the case of the forest will exist, can hatch the nest, so that the nest can appear in the most appropriate posture in this plane, eliminating the need to change the shape of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard traveled around, the Greenson plane was also a few years old. The population in the base city has already reached tens of thousands, and the tree of life has grown to the advanced level. At the peak of the former, deforestation is always going on, and it is fruitful. The result is that Linhai is constantly being opened up, and the forest will is forced to retreat accordingly. Now it is more than two hundred kilometers away from the base city, the forest will appear. In the suburbs of the base city, more than a dozen piles of wood have been opened, and there are millions of rock piles piled up inside. They are too late to burn, and it is too late to be transported out of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
