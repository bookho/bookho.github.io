			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman has unparalleled explosive power and speed, fighting skills It’s horrifying, and after copying and digitizing her actions with Richard’s true talent, I can’t find any improvement. Although she has only 18 grades, she is just entering the gates of the sanctuary, but the real combat power is by no means a level. White nights have the ability to explode most of the power in an instant, and the power of a single blow is unusually large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the hot Richard has been able to complete the same level of the Master, if the use of the sand is boiling, it is the 14th and 5th Master Will die in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Richard knows why White Night is so obsessed with life. This configuration is tailor-made for her talent, with her fierce attack power, coupled with explosive shooting speed, will indeed set off a killing storm on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, the look of the white night that Richard looks at again is naturally different. However, he suddenly jumped in the eyelids, and it turned out that the white night actually began to dismember the work of the body. The captain of the horse is much larger and the white nights take more time. However, looking at the enemies who were just quite intelligent and powerful, they were magically decomposed under the white nights. Li suddenly felt that the stomach was a little twitching, and some of them wanted to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much room for the captain of the team to be used, and only the heart is removed in the night. However, in order to collect the black crystals, the white night almost completely dismembered the body and the captain of the Nolande elephant into a piece of minced meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While dismembering, the white night speaks in a mechanically hoarse voice: "The Encore people are two levels higher than the mouse, which is the Dakosodas plane. One of the main battles is also the backbone of the absolute battlefield. The captain of the team is also the middle and upper reaches of Dakosodas. We have many opportunities to meet them in the future. In fact, the Angkor people can use a lot of things, for example Their skins are good materials for the top quality leather, and their spines can refine the epic magical rifles. Finally, their heart, that is the source of strength, can also be used as a sacrifice. But because of bringing you, I can't take too many things, the skin and the spine are too big, just give up and bring the heart back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think that the head of the Encore team was so valuable. Do other Dakso Das strongs of similar ranks with the Encore people also produce sacrifices? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night seems to know what Richard is thinking, saying: "As long as you reach this level, most Dakso Das will have organs that unite strength. It is the sacrifice of God's grace that can be exchanged from the Eternal Dragon Temple. Even if it is a strong sanctuary, it is only possible to obtain sacrifices on its own strength in the field of extinction. Otherwise, with the power of the individual, it may not be a lifetime. A sacrificial sacrifice. For example, this heart can be used for a minimum level of sacrifice as long as two. So the sanctuary that survived the battlefield is generally stronger than the sanctuary that has not entered the battlefield. More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is deeply impressed, this is the attraction of the absolute battlefield. Richard, who once saw a list of super-long gods, knows how wide the coverage of the eternal and time-honored dragons is, and how magical it is. It can be said that even if there is an ordinary person who is nothing, as long as there is enough grace, the heap can also pile up a strong sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black crystals obtained from the captain of the team are dozens of times more than the mouse demon, which is also a great asset. Of course, the gains are directly proportional to the difficulties. The head of the Encore team is a 19th-level powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night and Richard continued to move forward, and it took a long time to encounter another battle. This time it was the Scala Bear Chief Warlord, a character that was weaker than the Angkor team captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard tried to join the battle, but instead of using the traditional magician’s method, he added himself to various types of gain magic and took the short knife. Walk around the edge of the battlefield and carefully look for a chance to make a critical strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sksar Bear Chief Warlord is generally a humanoid, highly close to three meters. The surface of his body is a hard skin that is cracked into pieces. In fact, it is equivalent to armor. The defensive power is even more terrible than the full-scale armor of human warriors. He has an amazingly large head with hard black hair. The long mouth is covered with fangs, and some of the pieces that have not been polished by the food even highlight the corners of the lips. It is said that one can bite the weapon made of forged black stellite. Because it looks very similar to the bear head, this creature is called the bear chief overseer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking feature of the Panda Chief Warlord is not the bear head, but the huge hang between the legs. This race is completely male and, like some dragons, can be mated with creatures of any other race. After the successful mating of the mating, all the students born were the Scorsal bears. During the pregnancy, the little bears will absorb most of the vitality of the mother. The first thing to give birth is to eat their mother first. The most frightening thing is that the bear man has an unparalleled vitality during the embryo. Most magical drugs and violent impacts can't hurt it, and the fierce means will kill the mother. Therefore, the female of any race does not want to fall into the hands of the bear chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bear of the sergeant saw the white night, immediately excited and mad, snarling, ** is tall and standing. However, what is strange is that his penis not only has not become bigger, but has shrunk a lot. It was not until later that Richard discovered from the information that the size of the male weapon of the Xiongshou Warlord would be automatically adjusted according to the body shape of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absolute battlefield, everyone is basically independent, especially such a fierce guy like White Night. Therefore, Richard was the first to see the change of the bear’s first military in the face of the white night. And his memory ability is not inferior to the white night's combat power, and naturally this picture is firmly imprinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard arrived on the day of the day, and knew the characteristics of the bear’s first overseer, Richard suddenly realized that the size he saw that day was white night. The limit of accommodation. In this way, isn't it like the side knows the data of the white night? But at that time, Richard did not have no mourning. Instead, he had a cold sweat for the first time. If the white night understood it, he would not know how to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the latter thing, and in front of him, White Night made Richard see a picture that would never be forgotten. She stepped on the squad of the bear's first warlord and stepped on the organ with obvious characteristics into a meat sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** is the most deadly weakness of the bear chief, this is the secret of the open land. However, there are few who dare to use such weaknesses. That is because after the ** was attacked, the bear’s first warlord will immediately fall into a violent state, and the combat power will soar, so most people are still willing to use a stupid way to sharpen the defense and life. They are all amazing bears, and they turn a blind eye to his biggest weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night certainly won’t be so troublesome. After a slap on the squad of the bear’s first warlord, she immediately posted it on the warlord’s body, and then it was a series of let’s Unexplained attacks, turned over the natural enemies of this female creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made progress in this battle, knowing how to use the Green Flame Sword to strengthen the attack power of his weapon, and then stabbed the tail of the bear’s first warlord. It was also one of the weakest areas of defense and left a small wound with two fingers wide. This little injury is similar to being bitten by a worm. However, for Richard, this is a historic improvement. White night said that killing people does not need to distinguish between magic and martial arts, and what to use. Richard took the first step on this road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
