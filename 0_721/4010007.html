Richard actually planned to kick out the red Cossack, which took up a quarter of the share, from the Blue Water Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard explained the plan roughly, and then Tiffman immediately pointed out two questions: "First, the algorithm is called, the adult, he and Luofu is not the opponent of the other two sanctuary strong. Second, if we can hold the other sanctuary, can you sweep the red Cossacks? You know, they are famous for their fierceness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled calmly and said: "The first question I have to solve is just a price. As for the second question, the answer is 'Yes." '.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big fat man’s eyes are bright, his hands are on his hands, and he says, “Somewhat!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal with Tiffman was finalized. Big fat man has his own set of logic. Since Richard can convince Amman, the grasp must be great, and Richard’s previous record also gives him great confidence. Anyway, the Jinhui battle flag is not afraid of the red Cossack. Falcao is indeed not as good as the other's sanctuary, but another Thunder who is dealing with affairs in the distance can eat one of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The covenant has been finalized, but a pre-step is required to be effective. Richard needs to bring back thousands of slaves before he can continue to cooperate. In other words, he also has to prove his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Amman and Tiffman, Richard’s military power on the bright side is not worth mentioning at all. Although they do not intend to explore the cards of old friends, Li The investigation must show the actual results to prove his ability to launch the covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sun rises again, Richard takes his subordinates to the nest. At dusk, he returned to the blue water oasis, followed by a long team. Although the number of slaves is less than 8,000, it is almost the same. The ranks of eight thousand slaves are very spectacular at first glance. At the forefront of the slavery team, Richard’s team of less than a thousand is very thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight thousand slaves came to the blue water oasis and almost alerted the entire oasis. Many people still don't know the origins of these slaves, but such a huge number of people's interests can be understood by a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people are envious and hot, and some even wonder if they can snatch the slaves. However, Tiffman and Amman joined forces and presented a welcoming posture to make the people who are ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few people who can see the mystery. From the composition of the Richards team, we can roughly infer the speed of marching. Back and forth, plus the time spent on the integration of slaves, can infer the battle time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman and Tiffman stood side by side, could not help but look at each other, they all saw the shock of the other side of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very aware of the guardian strength of the Red Cossacks, and there are hundreds of miles in the near future. At their discretion, even if the battle process is completely crushed, it will be normal to return at least two hours late. After all, after the march, the soldiers should be fully rested and eaten, and then they can resume their physical strength before they can launch an attack. However, Richard came back so early that he only said that the rest and fighting time were short enough. Amman and Tiffman had a new understanding of the combat effectiveness of the Richards, and the other thing that shocked them was how many people Richard brought out, and how many people were brought back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the red Cossack become so vulnerable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffman and Amman floated this question almost simultaneously. However, the two old foxes immediately knew that this was their own illusion. The fighting power of the red Cossacks has only been enhanced and has not weakened. This can only show that the strength of the Richards is too strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible that Richard has secret forces that are not exposed, but it is also impossible, replenishment, stationing and scheduling are big problems, if it is not possible There is no clue. And how can the intelligence networks of these two old foxes leak the military intelligence around their home base camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, even though Richard has a quantitative advantage, the slave camp guards have a good position, with fortifications, 500 people stick to it, plus a few hundred It’s not easy for Ma’s mobile forces to swallow them in a short time. At least Amman and Tiffman know that if they know the generals who lead the army, let alone take less than a thousand people, that is, two or three thousand people may not be able to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Amman and Tiffman, Richards stopped the horse and raised his hand to them, then pointed to the back and smiled . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefman slammed his head and turned back to the entourage behind him: "Not ready yet! Those are our slaves! Camp, escort, Food and doctors are all ready? How did I tell you this morning, how are you still stupidly standing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several entourage doubts What did Tiffman tell you this morning? Don't say eight thousand slaves, that is, eighty slaves, they will not do it! But who can be stupid with the people around Big Fat? One by one even claimed to be, with fear of fear, flying to go to handle what Tiffman had just ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important and cumbersome things like the transfer of slaves naturally go hand in hand. Richard took the entourage back to the hotel. Believe this, he has given the Jinhui Battle Flag and the strength of Marquis Allek a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red Cossacks are not only dominated by the sanctuary and the hot style, their guards have always been known for their fierce fighting power, which is also very important for strength. component. This is an army that is comparable to the power of the Marquis, so everyone is jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary and the elite army are the double-edged swords of the war. One or two strong people in the sanctuary cannot match the army of scale, just like a lion does not dare to face the wolves. However, an army without a strong man will be miserable in the face of the sect of the Sanctuary. A defensive inadvertentness may even be carried out by the Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s proof of the Jinhui Battle Flag and the Power Marquis is not his strength in magic or construction, but the ability to command the army. As long as Richard has the ability to defeat the Red Cossacks with equal or slightly superior strength, then the Jinhui Battle Flag and the Power Marquis will support him. As for the strength, it is not a problem at all. Whether it is the Jinhui Battle Flag or the Power Marquis, it can provide a sufficient number of soldiers and equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard has become the focus of the entire oasis city. Hundreds of eyes fell on Richard, including envy, curiosity, and hostility and hatred. Although no one has publicly discussed it, the gossip spreads very quickly, and the insiders know where the slaves came from. Only the red Cossack camp nearby has slaves of this size. Moreover, Richard and the red Cossack are enemies, and it is already an open secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding on the back of a tall war horse, Richard can almost overlook most people in the city. This is similar to his current status, even in the entire bloody area, Richard has become a small and famous person. Now in the land that belongs to him, the servants who have been hired have already been in place, began large-scale construction, and refurbished the original building. The land originally belonging to Stricker is also attributed to Richard’s name, which is large enough to build a large camp that can accommodate three thousand slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
