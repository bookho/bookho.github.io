			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle finally burned to the end and the room was dark. I have just experienced an unprecedented squally shower, and finally put my own anxiety and dreams to my mouth. Irene only feels tired and constantly rushing into my heart, my eyelids are heavy like a lead, and finally I can't resist the closing. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slept uneasy and kept dreaming. Many dreams are bizarre, even just a meaningless, grotesque picture. But there is a dream that makes her heart beat faster. She dreamed that she owed a lot of money to Richard, and that Richard had to come to collect debt every night, and to collect it several times a night, but the debt is still owed more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Irene opened her eyes, she still saw the familiar ceiling. The curtains that were pulled apart during the strenuous exercise last night were not completely closed. The faint light cast from the upper part of the skylight, representing the world outside the dark blue is noon. Irene was taken aback and sat up. In order to alleviate even a little debt burden, she has become accustomed to the intense rhythm of life, and there has never been a time to sleep late. But when she sat up, she suddenly remembered, Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is empty, and the place where Richard was lying is replaced by a paper that is familiar in style and format. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a payment voucher with a face value of 31,600 gold coins and the signature is Richard. After paying off all the arrears, the money is enough for Irene to live in luxury for three years in the fringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the huge numbers above, this thin paper has become very heavy. But holding this piece of paper that is enough to change the fate, Irene's heart is full of hollows and lost, tears can no longer stop, big drops of water are pouring out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a thin layer of clouds condensed on the ice floes, and occasionally a few beams of sunlight penetrated the clouds to shine on the sea. A layer of finely colored light. Although the sea surface has been thawed, it still has sporadic icebergs, shining in the sun with a dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still dark, because of the lack of sunlight, the wind is also extremely cold. It was another gust of wind that blew the corners of Richard's magic robes, and all the chills were injected into it, letting the boy fight a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing at the beach at this moment, a few meters away is the straight cliff-down coast. The waves slammed the rocky shore rocks, occasionally igniting huge splashes, and even splashed at the foot of Richard. The coastal cliffs are high and steep. The place where Richard stands is about 20 meters away from the sea, but the seemingly tranquil sea also contains a lot of power, and the power that occasionally erupts is enough to make people feel thrilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dark reef under the foot of Richard, which was eroded by waves and sea breeze over the years, so it was full of deep gullies. In the edge of the rock crevice, there are little white flowers growing. Its name is Xinglan, which is the most common kind of plant in the ice floe bay. Its tenacious vitality allows it to grow in almost any environment. In most of the year, the temperature does not exceed 10 degrees in the north, but It can be seen all year round, and it may have been frozen in the ice of the volcano the night before. As long as it dissolves slightly, it will stand upright and stand up thin branches and leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked by the sea and occasionally leaned over to pick a star orchid. After a while, he had a bunch of star orchids in his hand and a little white flowers. When they get together, they are not glamorous, but they are beautiful because of purity and peace. He climbed a small hill, where the view was wide, the arc of the entire ice floe was visible, and the other direction was the magnificent dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze rushed in front of it, with a thick wet and cold, the waves were whispering, I don't know what to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over and dug open the cold soil, dug a small pit, and put the little white flower into the pit. Gently buried in the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard stood up again, he suddenly felt a lot easier. He greeted the sea breeze and sipped a cold wind. He only felt that the rich suffocation showed the grandeur and grandeur of the ice floe. He turned and left, and the dark magic robe danced in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the hill, the burial was the youthfulness, innocence of his youth, and a dream that was once beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Deep Blue, Richard returned to his familiar place and once again began a schedule that suffocated bystanders. Irene, Minnie, Blood Parrot, and Stevenson, when all the clues are put together, the truth of the truth is ready. Richard believes that he can see, Su Hailun and her great magisters must be able to see. How to deal with it, Richard does not intend to take the initiative to ask questions, he is even prepared to forget all the things that have happened, and fully devoted to the exploration of the magical world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now understands that for specific opponents, such as Stevenson and Minnie, each time they move forward, they are a heavy burden on them. The blow, because the road leading to the builder is a single-wood bridge that only allows one person to pass. This is a war that no one can give back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases, power is actually relative, and the stronger it is, the weaker the opponents are. And Richard now understands that with his current progress in all areas of magic, he will only feel suffocated and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blood-stained conspiracy, so quietly disappeared into the dust of history, as if nothing had happened, even a rumor about that night None of them appeared in dark blue. The disciples of the legendary mage have never been assassinated, and the law enforcement group of the Master has not been sent to maintain law and order. The traces of magic burning in the depths of the alleys are not noticed. It seems that it is just another graffiti when the rogues are bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this conspiracy can't really have no consequences, and the consequences are very serious, but the consequences are limited to a small group of related people. As for the intelligence dealers who have always been well-informed, they are very clear about what can be sold, and what is the reminder of death. For some things, if the big blues have not made qualitative conclusions, then they do not exist, and naturally they will not be on their intelligence list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the night when the blood parrot lost news, Stevenson became extremely anxious. Richard's schedule is as sophisticated as the alchemy machinery, and all the details of the trap are perfectly arranged. If the fish does not bite, then the alternate set of plans will be activated immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went very smoothly from the beginning, all the people and things were carried out according to the script, until at the scheduled time, the blood parrot sent back the target has entered Assassination of the area signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the most proud part of this program by Stevenson. The blood parrots once raised objections. The assassination scheme they received was very rigorous, making full use of the terrain, and completely eliminating the possibility of accidentally entering the area to interfere with the assassination, but it was performed by seven people. The goal is just a three-level rookie magician, they are all killers of level 10 or above, even one-on-one can kill people. Even if you don't calculate the high cost of moving too many people, it is a nuisance for many killers to mix into the dark blue without any traces in a very short time. But in the end, the blood parrot was still accepted. After all, it is the uncle who spends money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
