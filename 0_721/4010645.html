			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is very obvious, the iron and blood Dagong can sacrifice the Xiong Peter and Joseph family For more benefits, the core territory of Archimonde must be left intact in the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xionpide is no longer a floating island giant, but the Duke of Joseph is in this conference hall, facing the iron-blooded red/naked/naked benefits. The duke just smiled a bit, and there was no suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core figure of Archimonde is Richard, a big builder, a big magician who is close to the legendary power, and is now in a rapid upward trend. In contrast, Joseph, who was badly hurt in the war against Archimonde, was sacrificed mercilessly in exchange for Archimonde not being divided. As for Joseph’s feelings, he is not considering it at the moment. Within the circumstances, the reason why the negotiations were conducted by the personally-incorporated person was to ensure that there was no objection in the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for fairness, only in the dimension of strength will there be fairness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashan is the core territory of Archimonde. After a territory is divided into other empire, the transfer is only the sovereignty of this territory, and the lord’s territory Most of the rights will be preserved. That is to say, if all the territory of a Marquis is transferred from the Holy Alliance to the Holy Tree Dynasty, then he is still the Marquis, and he still owns those territories, but his object of paying taxes and sending troops to war is changed from Holy Alliance to Holy Land. Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three great empires, as the borderline has changed over the centuries, many long-established big families have corresponding territories in the three empires, such as Some of the territories that Ellie had laid down belonged to the sacred dynasty. The territorial tax still had to be handed over to the sacred dynasty. Since the accumulated area did not break through the ranks of the count, it was only possible to use the agent in the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the situation that Richard is facing now is more complicated. Simply put, it will be split, and in the Marquis territory of Gordon, Ashan leads it. In terms of its area and production, it is actually a Piaget. If it is classified into other empires, it will be awarded the corresponding Earl in the empire, and the other territories left by Gordon plus the part that Richard himself obtained are barely enough. An earl collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the division is successful, Richard will be the Earl of the Confederacy and other Earl of the Empire in the future. This is a very delicate situation. The Earl is a great aristocrat. With the watershed of the small aristocracy, the Earl of the field automatically obtained the seat of the House of Lords, the three empires are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Milanes and Kimballa strived for the vestige of the Yuanwang Peninsula, they insisted on obtaining a complete Ashan collar and resolutely disagreed with the split. So far, the purpose of the sacred dynasty and the millennial empire was apparent, and they all clearly stared at it. Richard, as long as the core territory of Archimonde is overtaken, and then slowly contact and draw, there is always a chance to dig out the sacred alliance from the sacred alliance, and the tyrants have also seen the key, so they are determined not to give in. In no way give the sacred dynasty and the Millennium Empire any chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between the three parties in Ashan was unexpectedly fierce, and they did not give in. The Earl of Kimbeye, who had been acting carelessly, suddenly showed the momentum that he was determined to win. I am not willing to give in, even if it is on the other side, there are several times the territory and a magic crystal mine with a low reserve is not hesitating and shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce debate for nearly an hour and no final result, so the three parties decided to temporarily suspend the meeting and continue to discuss the details of the demarcation in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the conference hall, Earl of Gold Baye quickly came to Richard and handed over a dark gold-plated invitation, smiling "Hello, Mr. Richard, can you have an afternoon tea together tomorrow? If you are willing to take me to visit the magnificent shisha, it would be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard did not reach out and shook his head and said frankly: "I feel that afternoon tea with you is not a good choice at this time, I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time the two have fallen to the end, and the giants seem to have turned a blind eye to the count's behavior, no one cast a superficial look, Jinbeiye looked at the backs of everyone, smiled, and suddenly lowered the voice, Said: "We will sooner or later be the lords under the Millennium Empire. What is the relationship with drinking tea together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also smiled and said: "You It’s so confident.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Gold Baye replied freely: “Of course, confidence is not just coming The importance and sincerity of the empire to a future sacred sect, including the lord from Calando, Lord Richard, don’t forget that the blood of the emperor is also flowing under the mountain and the sea. You are actually Half an imperial man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl now throws the most weighty words: "In the Holy Alliance, I did not see them treating you like you, but only Seeing rejection, conspiracy, construction, and even murder.” The count’s voice is diametrically opposed to his ordinary appearance. Even when it comes to such a serious murder, it’s like singing a hymn with a kind of confusion. The charm of the human heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a few days ago, I witnessed you being chased by the lower aristocrats of the whole floating world, but no giants really stood up. Richard, you know the history, you should be clear that the lower aristocrats attack the upper aristocracy will be What kind of consequences, they did not regard you as their own, why do you still have to stay in such a country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the count, Li In fact, it is very difficult to answer. If you want to trace history, the three empires are of the same kind. After the Terran gradually multiply and grow on the multi-racial continent of Noland, countless lords have fought and fought in the long years. In the end, three different empires were formed. In this process, the lords changed their camps for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with Richard’s current political wisdom, it can be seen that the Earl’s words are actually not well-informed, and the circle’s already stable upper-level aristocracy rejects new faces. It’s the same everywhere. If the floating island giants of the Holy Alliance join the Millennium Empire, it’s not necessarily that they will not encounter similar things. The key is the Earl’s first sentence, “The importance and sincerity of a future holy constructor.” It is the greatest value of Richard in the eyes of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the count seems to have another hole, but it has not yet been taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard still didn’t say anything, just shook his head resolutely, bowed slightly to the count, and then left, the Earl of Kimbey hangs his eyes and looks Look at the invitation that was not sent out, and then reveal a smile that is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords is full of nobles, they are sitting in the Chamber of Defence, waiting for the results from the small conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare today that no one has spoken or debated, nor has it been noisy, all the nobles are waiting quietly, and the miraculous silence in the hall of the meeting, seeing one The heads of the giants walked out of the small conference hall. All the nobles shouted and stood up. They all came up and had direct questions about the relationship with the giants. They were not qualified to climb the relationship and waited outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I can see the difference between the contacts and the underlying. Even the people around the Duke of Anan have more than a dozen people, but almost no one asks Li. Check the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is like a long wing. In the twinkling of an eye, all the nobles know the preliminary demarcation plan. For a time, people are silent, I don’t know what to say, though This is not the final plan, but it is almost the same. The two dividing lines are not only two noose lines, but also two shame columns, which have nailed all the nobles of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
