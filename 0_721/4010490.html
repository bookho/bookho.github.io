Richard wisely decided to open the topic, and then placed two time hourglasses In front of Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence’s face immediately became very weird, and it was emotional, but also helpless. He stared at the two hourglasses for a few minutes before he looked up. Q: "You must have spent a lot of sacrifices before you switched to these two things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lawrence asked, Richard also felt that No: "Oh, not too much, but the chance of getting a hourglass seems to be a little less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers the first sacrifice He just had a wish in his heart, and then there was a whole hourglass, and now, after a lot of sacrifices, the amount of hourglasses obtained is similar to the first time, and the ratio can be much lower. Of course, Li In the sacrifice, he also got a lot of messy things, such as a lot of quasi-legendary equipment, the number of which can make the core followers one, but the number of timeglasses he wants most. But it is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence looked at Richard and sighed and said, "Unfortunately, the two things you brought, whether it is three or two years. There will be only one year of effect on me, and it will not be fully invalid in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is not the case, then the strong ones are not eternal life, even God will fall, the plane will be destroyed, as a person, die early It’s no difference in two years of late death,” Lawrence said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a frown: "You didn't talk to me before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence Sighed and said: "I just said, you should do what you should do until you hit the wall, and now you feel it. Time is more and more difficult to take. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha double eyebrows open and said: "It doesn't matter, two years is good, I will always get a sacrifice, you see, I have When I arrived, I got a few sacrifices back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard pointed to the parcels thrown on the ground, where there were various materials equivalent to intermediate sacrifices, and a large number of black crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that your kid is a bit of a skill." Lawrence rarely praised Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "There is still a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard Taking off his shirt and revealing his body, Lawrence’s face changed dramatically and cried: “What do you want to do, I am old, not good,”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha cried and laughed, and Lawrence called a little more magical distraction. He hurriedly calmed his mind, ignored the strange thoughts of Lawrence, launched the magical armed forces, and the large pieces of electro-optic spilled from Richard. A ball of electric light surrounds him constantly, and on the skin, the lines of the magical armed forces are looming, adding a little mystery and majesty to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My magical armor." Lawrence jumped up immediately, but when he looked closely, his mouth grew bigger and he said incoherently: " No, no, unlike my original design, damn, the power of output is much greater, how can you get it, ... no, hell, you changed the core design, which will make the whole frame The difficulty is greatly improved...you have really changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard's words made Lawrence immediately round his eyes and exclaimed: "That is not to become a fifth-order structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, On the difficulty, it is still a little worse than the real fifth-order construction," Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only a little, you damn guy, I really want to kill you." Lawrence said with a jump, but the tone was gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the ability of the magical armed forces, and smiles and says: "But the required carrying capacity is also close to a fifth-order structure. I still have several I was so ruthless that I wanted to upgrade some of the other structures, but now I can't do it. Hey, my magical ability is not a magical reincarnation, but a magic melting pot."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence shook his head and said, "Kid, you think too well, the magical reincarnation is gone, but you don’t think about the magic melting pot, as far as I know. The magic furnace seems to have requirements for race and blood. It is actually the ability of some extremely rare race blood to awaken. In fact, among the three magic powers, I think the magic furnace is far superior to the other two, but There are so many great mentors who awaken this ability, so they are not revealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the magic furnace seems to be the most useless one." Richard was somewhat convinced to refute. Lawrence sneered and said, "I can give a very simple example. We are fighting with each other. I have 10,000 people in my hand, and you only have three thousand." This is how you want to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my soldiers are more elite!" Richard retorted, and he was used to winning less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Essence, hehe." Lawrence sneered a few times before he said: "The ability to awaken the existence of the magic furnace, its own racial talent is extremely powerful, on magic manipulation On the magic power, it is definitely not much worse than you. What kind of elite you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way." Richard is still unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, stinky boy, if you encounter a big magician who has the magic furnace ability in the future, be careful not to conflict with him. It is said that this ability The more abnormal it is, the more abnormal it will be. Once such a big magician enters the legend, he will immediately leave the other masters behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately remembered, My own teacher is the one who has the magic melting pot, and she is not ordinary even when it is not legendary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will." Richard nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence said: "Give me a copy of your magical armed design, then don't rush back, I will study your design and see I can't help you improve it any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will stay here for a week." Richard has already prepared a design. , handed it to Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence took the design and looked at it for a long time before he sighed. Some of them lost ground and said: "This thing, that is, I may not have done it in the past, you Don't hold too much expectation, I probably won't be able to help you, and at most add a little change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled: "Enough." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little change that St. Lawrence said is of great significance. This is close to the fifth-order magical armed forces, even if it is the slightest change, it is extremely difficult. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence turned around and said, "Yes, I have to remind you. Now you can also do the fourth-order construction. Look at the whole Noland, and you will be able to surpass you in the field of construction." There are more, but I want to make the fame of the decoration, especially if I want to leave some design that can make people remember, it is powerful or not."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Powerful is not enough." Richard is really strange this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence said with a mysterious face: "Yes, it is necessary to add some light and shadow effects, which is why the builders are often artists." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light and shadow effect, what is it for?" Richard still did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For example, the fifth-order structure is also the most powerful, but it is the most famous in all five-stage construction. Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is said that St. Peter was inspired by God and had the design of the armed forces of heaven. Is this the reason?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shrine of the shit." Lawrence took a sip and said, "The birds of Noland can also think of the design of the fifth-order structure." Well, even if they really have this ability, will they choose Peter’s old bald guy, who has nothing else in his eyes except the gold coins and the scepter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After cursing a St. Peter, Lawrence said: "The key to the armed forces of heaven is that it can inspire a pair of light wings. Yes, it is a wing made up of light, except that it cannot fly. Have all the functions that wings can have, what, right, you are right, that is a pair of pure waste of energy West, but I once saw the armed forces of heaven, which is the useless light wing, which made it the most sleek fifth-order structure. This is why the heavenly armed forces rank the first of all the fifth-order structures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is for the sake of beauty and the wind." Richard is hard to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very important, it is related to how much your structure can sell, you don't underestimate this, it can make your structure The selling price has doubled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence pointed out to Richard and said, "For example, if you are armed, the few electric balls are Very good ideas, quite a wind, of course, they still have a lot of room for improvement, for example, the number can be more, can also be bigger, around the track of your flight? ahref="http://www.wkfdu.
