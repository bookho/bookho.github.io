Continue to move southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich, what should I do now?" She has been following the nearest place in Richard and has heard all the information clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichai took a breath and said: "The original plan must be changed! Since it is the woman led by Sinclair, we are not able to fight her now. Ability. She has already arrived near the Blue Water Oasis and will definitely know that we exist. So... must take risks!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are you going to do?” asked the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped the saddle and thought, slowly saying: "I am going to meet our lord, the Duke of the Wolf." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a sudden hoof in the distance, and a team of more than a dozen knights appeared on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this is another aristocratic lord who has retreated from the front line. No matter how old or young they are, the height of the title is good, the riding is not bad, and the eyes are sharp and sensitive, and they can escape from Sinclair's claws in time. Of course, from another point of view, they are also some of the subordinates who have left their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already received enough information and has reached a preliminary trade agreement with Viscount Assad, and is now not interested in the latest situation on the front line. So, did not let the hand down to intercept the team of knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the team knight turned suddenly and went straight to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the instructions of the police, the soldiers who have experienced many bloody battles have automatically changed the queue, protecting the legal personnel in the center, and the cavalry turning to the two wings. Always ready to attack. Since Richard did not order to stop the march, these were all done on the move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a small force of less than twenty rides, and did not see any powerful characters, maybe they could kill them as soon as a surprise attack . After competing with the tactics of Sharonville's wolves, Richard's men now have not put this small-scale conflict at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight rushing knights have been able to stop the horses at a close distance of about ten meters. The gravel and gravel splashing under the horseshoes have even collapsed into the front row of barbarians. On the human warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee frowned, waved, and the team stopped in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current barbarian warriors are mostly armed with heavy shields and axe. Only a few warrior martial arts do have talented warriors who will be equipped with heavy weapons. The shield has a defensive posture. The opposite knight is already rude and provocative, and many barbarian warriors have an angry expression on their faces, but no one is moving. They are used to obeying orders, and if there is no order from Richard, they will follow the designated actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s contract followers are looking at me, I look at you, and then together cast an incredible gaze to the opposite knights. All the forces encountered in the blood-stained land, whether strong or weak, have never seen such a lack of eyesight, and the district 20 rides dare to provoke a team of hundreds of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this distance, there is no need for anything else. With a single order, the barbarian in the front row of the barbarian’s axe in the hand can be thrown out, and the team can be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a very young aristocrats in the center of the knight, and the gorgeous clothes are more than one hundred kilograms of obese body. The young aristocrat has no more than five levels of strength, but has a ride that is not commensurate with strength and weight. At least the speed of escape has not been slow, of course, the horse he has left is definitely a good thing, the most tall and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head, proudly looked at the opposite person, and finally his eyes deliberately stayed on Richard for a moment, focusing on Richard’s magician robe and nobles. Signet. After seeing a completely unfamiliar emblem, the arrogance on his face that was too thick to be thickened was as thick as it was to drip out. He didn't even bother to talk, just waving his fat hand to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight is moving forward. Just ten meters away, the horse jumped into the front row of barbarian warriors. The Warriors stood up and made two turns in the same place, then the front hooves fell, less than two meters away from the barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the Cavaliers are well controlled, but that the horse itself is motivated by the invisible murder of the team and never dares to move forward. The expression of the knight was the same as that of his master. His nostrils were in the air, and it seemed that he did not see the anger of the barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a great and noble highland unicorn keeper, Heim! Who are you? Immediately report to you!" The Cavalier shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha raised his hand slightly, stopping the further movements of his men. All the wind teeth are in the same place, they represent the mind of Richard, they do not move, the slave soldiers will not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Richard, Richard Archimonde, a pioneering knight in the Duke of the Wolf," Richard said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the title of the pioneer, the knights under Him’s men even laughed arrogantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the noble viscounts are no longer paying attention to Richard, but focus on the face of the sand. Even among hundreds of people, the quicksand is very eye-catching. Aside from her beautiful face, the amber eyes and the double eyebrows add a lot of mysterious and strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight in front of the horse stretched out the whip, and the volley made a big circle, including the barbarian warriors and the sand people, and did not let the ogre And the half-orcs, and even many of the soldiers who first followed Richard, also joined the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to develop the Cavaliers, you are lucky, the noble Him is now in need of escort! Now I declare that these slaves have been requisitioned, you can bring Your personal guards are gone, move fast, don't force me to give punishment!" The knight is arrogant and underground, and the look is like a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even remember the name of Richard. In the aristocratic relationship, this was a great rudeness, not to mention that he was not a nobleman. The more so, the more arrogant he is, the more arrogant than the real Viscount Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Hem screamed, then gasped and pointed to the sand, saying, "The woman I bought!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian knight saw the sand flowing in the direction of the Viscount's fingers, and the eyes also shot the fascinating greed. But he turned his back to the Viscount and did not let Him see his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
