			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the light appears in the air, the light condenses into a transmission The door, flying out of the three angels, they are handsome, the armor and the giant sword in their hands indicate that they are soldiers who serve God, not simple singers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three angels have seventeen levels of power, only one step away from the sanctuary, but the natural wings make them faster than the human sanctuary. It is also more flexible, so it is difficult to deal with, and one out is three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s face changed slightly, and when he swears damn, he pulls out the sacred killing. Now he has no other guards besides the mountains and the sea. The girl then untied an unremarkable iron rod from behind, watching the angels, and some of them could not lift their spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three angels volleyed, and in a moment they were hanged by Richard for three or four negative states of magic, but the angels’ actions did not receive much Influence, they are very resistant to magic by the power of the gods. This is one of the advantages of the angel tradition. In the twinkling of an eye, the three angels fight with Richard, the mountain and the sea, and fight for a time. The light flame splashed around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the temple, Martin smiled and said to the bishop: "Look, now their advantage is not that big."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this is incredible..." The bishop ate and said, but his eyes glanced at the holy script in Martin’s hand from time to time. Just when Martin was mourning the scriptures, there were three pages of pages suddenly. Burning, turned into ashes, after they burned, there appeared Silver Knight, high-level church, and three angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop has confirmed that this is a kind of summoning, but the price is the page of the holy book, to protect the Holy Land by means of damage to the holy things, and to understand his doctrine For a while, it is not clear whether this is awkward or meritorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was entangled with the angels and directed the battles everywhere. The vague uneasiness in his heart was stronger, except for the last three angels. In addition, the appearance of the Yinhui Knight and the Templar was very different. Richard had never heard of it. He looked up at the majestic Great St. Louis Temple and saw the angel statue at the top of the temple exuding strong The Holy Light, a ** Shenghui falls like a petal, falls on the priests and warriors, adds spiritual power and vindictiveness to them, heals the wounds, and within the shroud of the St. Louis Temple, both the priest and the Silver Knight, the combat power is improved. At a level, the St. Louis Temple has a long history, and the power stored in it must be like the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be quick and fast..." Richard thought silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze inadvertently swept a fallen Silver Knight, the first knight to be killed since their appearance, the body The surface is showing a strong sacred light, suddenly burning fiercely, turning into a light column, going to the sky, and in the place where he had fallen, leaving only a scorch mark, Richard’s heart, immediately know This is an extremely powerful summoning that can make the summoning target exactly the same as the real Silver Knight, with no loss of power and a large number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes fell on Martin and his holy book. Who knows how many strange fighters can summon a warrior to see his well-being Three angels should not be the last cards. In an instant, Richard’s mind flashed more than a dozen tactics. They are all similar. To deal with the summoner, one way is to speed up his summoning. The other way is to kill the summoner. I, the two methods are difficult to distinguish between good and bad, but in Noland, senior priests are notoriously difficult to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was indulged, he decided to deal with these summoned things first. In a moment, Richard issued hundreds of orders in his consciousness. The thinker refined the fine-tuning of these instructions, and then reached each of the squadrons. All the squadrons burst into a strong momentum in an instant, completely ignoring their own safety and launching the most violent attacks at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen squadrons fell, but the Yinhui Knights almost died halfway, and Martin’s smile solidified on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin returned to normal in a blink of an eye, he continued to turn the Holy Scriptures, read the scriptures, this time still started with the Emoyan, but the content is tiny Change: "Then the Lord gave them the knight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soft voice of Martin and the burning of the Holy Scriptures, there are a number of Silver Knights. Appeared, the Knights of the Fengfeng almost immediately responded, and a dazzling interspersed, formed a new line of defense, and the original encirclement was unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart is awkward, knowing that the trouble is not over yet, and sure enough, after the Silver Knight, there are sacred warriors and angels, and now there are a total of six angels. Around the observation of the mountains and the sea, Richard took the initiative, and the sacred killing in his hand suddenly made a sharp tweet. A twist of the knife passed over the bodies of the two angels. A large golden blood suddenly appeared in the sky. When it touched the air, it burned fiercely, and then it turned into a holy light and rushed to the sky. As the two angels turned into nothingness, Richard’s face became pale. With such a full force, he could only issue three knives. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea also waved iron bars to an angel. The iron bars were not fast, but she seemed very strenuous. On the way to the swing, it was obvious that the iron bars were twisting and deforming, and the face of the angel The expression changed from anger to panic, and desperately fanned the wings, but how could it not fly away from the range of the iron stick, and instead was pulled closer and closer, eventually, he held the holy sword in despair, and held the mountain and the sea. Iron rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword was blown, but it was a muffled sound, and the angel screamed without a bang, and suddenly it burst into a burning light. Rushing to the sky, the face of the mountains and the sea is also slightly pale, the eyes are beginning to be blurred, and a pair of people want to sleep. This blow is her strongest means to attack the beast. Every time it is out, the attack power is several times of her usual level. But it will also consume more than half of her physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadrons have fallen to the top ten, in exchange for the first wave of the saga of the silver glory, Richard looked at Martin. The heart sinks slightly, because the young man smiles still sunny, he silently condenses five clouds of cloud at his fingertips and shoots into the sky. These Xingjing Thunderclouds are quite mature, and their power is slightly stronger than the eight-level magic. It’s not that the magic takes too long to be effective. It can definitely be classified as a nine-level magic. The followers have been following Richard for a long time. When he saw that he was laying down the Xingjing Thundercloud, he knew that the battle must be played for a long time, so he had a style one. Turn, more is to kill the opponent with combat skills, although the speed of killing the enemy is slow, but the time to continue the battle is greatly extended, even the ogre is a kind of calm, ten tons of waving It has also become a lot gentler, but how can this giant hammer be gentle, and you can fly a Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square in front of the temple was stunned, and the high-level bishop was sweating. His power was almost dry, and he prayed hard at the bottom of his heart, squeezing himself. A little potential, so I can squeeze out even the tiniest treatment or blessing. He knows that every time he releases a magical spell, someone will be saved, so even though the inside of the body is burning like a fire. The bishop also insisted on desperately. He didn't know how long he could hold on. He just thought it would be unbelievable to release the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining city defense forces in Toble City have gathered and approached the battlefield, but when they came to the periphery of the temple, the generals hesitated and never attacked. Command, the soldiers of the City Defense Army were pale, and they had been scared by the first wave of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard patiently and angels, and carefully commanded the troops, unless the perfect opportunity, no longer will be easily exchanged for the sacrifice of the Knights A large number of casualties of the enemy, a few minutes after the war, another angel was killed because of the injury, there are only two angels on the field, but Richard's trouble has just begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
