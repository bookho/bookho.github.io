I have a heart to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina also shared the same feeling and nodded, saying: "There is a good news and a bad news now. Which one do you want to listen to first?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Casually." Richard does not matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina wanted to peek into Richard’s character in this way, but failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had to say, "Okay! The good news is that we got the complete Schumpeter experimental base, and most of the magicians and alchemists inside surrendered." We are. So if there is enough time, we will harvest the results that should have belonged to Schumpeter. The bad news is that in a short time, I mean at least three years in Greenson, we would like to get more products. That is to say, the thing in this cabinet is the only one we can use. There are three people in the jade solution, and the crystallization toxic substance can be used twice, and the element is extracted once."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina added: "I think it is because of the presence of the jade solution and the crystallization of toxic substances that I have not seen the presence of sacred strongmen and war trees in the indigenous elves. I should have suffered a loss in Schumpeter. Otherwise, only myself, the city can’t hold it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said "Let me talk about the power system of the indigenous elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina Head, with Richard went deeper underground. Here is a cold hail, which is divided into specimens of dozens of creatures, most of which are various seedlings. Here is the specimen room established by Schumpeter to collect specimens of species that may be threatened in the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina pointed out to an adult aboriginal elf and said, "This is our most common enemy and the main shooter of the Green Sens." Because of the environment and tradition We call all the shooters collectively as forest shooters, but depending on the direction and the blood, there is obviously a more detailed way of dividing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the various levels of shooters, The Greenson Elf also includes careers such as Druid, Master, Wizard, and Warrior. There is also a sacrificial existence among them, and the work of sacrificing seems to be shared by Druid and the sacrificial priests. As far as the scope of the current exploration is concerned, the tribal system is still the main system of the Green Sen Elf. They do not seem to have formed a kingdom, and there is no imperial civilization as developed as the Norland Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Green Sens, the war plant represented by the tree is far more important than the Norland spirit. The elves and trees form a close relationship that is similar to symbiosis. Also because of the special environment of the plane, the power of the Green Forest Elf is far greater than that of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is a variety of exotic creatures living in the forest. Compared with the elves and the tree people, these creatures truly represent the characteristics of Green Forest. They are strange and unique in shape. Many of them contain deadly toxins, and insects are extraordinarily rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far fewer hawks and birds, most of them are small, fast, and fighting is not worth mentioning. This is still related to the plane environment. In front of the good-spirited elves, the end of the large raptors is only a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Lina’s explanation, Richard pondered for a moment and said, “First let the soldiers adapt to the environment. In addition, I have some troops to bring. They have come to say it again. In the past few days, we have cleaned up the forest around the city and, by the way, give the indigenous elves a bitter taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bitter?" Lina suddenly smiled, laughing very much. She took a small crystal bottle out of her pocket and said, "This is a result of my boring. This is a neurotoxin. Apply them to the warrior's weapon or arrow. Once you scratch a little skin, you will let The indigenous elves have unbearable severe pain. But otherwise, there is no other effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the bottle and looked deeply Lina glanced at it and then asked, "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only this. If you want more, you have to wait a few days, I You can do it again. But this painful remedy is only effective for ordinary warriors. The guy above the sanctuary can resist the pain of its production."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the medicine bottle in his hand and said, "It will be very useful! If you have time, get a few more bottles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Richard Just left the underground space of the castle. From beginning to end, he did not ask how Lina's painful remedy came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the city’s main house, he heard the exclamation from time to time in the military camp. It was the army that was originally stationed in the plane. Receiving new equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the barracks and saw the soldiers waiting in line to receive the equipment. On the playground open space, a box of magic boxes was opened, all of which were weapon armor with enchanting effects. They are only excellent grades of equipment, but for the soldiers stationed in Green Forest, it is only the middle-level officers who can use one or two pieces of fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Master followed Li’s body and saw that this scene was not complicated. She did not reprimand the soldiers’ noise, and took two steps in Richard’s ear. Whispered softly: "Is this all brought by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, yes. But the rank and strength of the soldiers stationed here are still a little worse, no The method is to exert the power of stronger equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina looked at the high-end box next to the playground and asked: "You bring together How many sets of equipment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of two thousand sets. Plus 500 sets of handcuffs and 50,000 sets of arrows. Unfortunately, the number of fighters is not enough. Hey, It seems that there is a lot of damage on your side during this time." Richard said with some regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Richard’s words, Lina suddenly had a feeling of being crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she followed Gordon, she often faced strong enemies, and the other equipment and supplies were far more than the standard, and often had their own wooden shields. Iron knife leather armor, on the enemy's complete set of refined chain armor. Archers and archery must be carefully calculated, because they often distribute more than a dozen arrows, sometimes even ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some of the standards of the giants, the equipment of Gordon’s army is stronger than the slave army. Even the thriving thirteen knights, all of them are abject poverty, and all their dividends and savings are spent on the body. In fact, they are not even equipped with their own structure. The reason is that all of them are third-order constructs, or that Gordon has paid for them. And Gordon’s money is a loan from Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of debt owed by Gotton has reached an unimaginable level. Every year, the interest of the legendary mage is repaid, and Lina feels that she can’t breathe. However, the man with a big nerve is not convinced, he continues to spend a lot of money, making money in the wind and rain, and carrying the people in the south to fight the North, invincible, to the expansion speed of the general family at least two or three generations, gradually Make an amazing foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
