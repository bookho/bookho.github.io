			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first to instigate the horse, training the fast horse to raise the iron hoof, all the way The trot ran to the shrine outside the kilometer. The shredded and dense horseshoes converge, gradually louder and more heart-warming. The blinds of a residential building on the roadside opened a line, and a person squinted at the window and almost screamed. He immediately grabbed his mouth, closed the window tightly, and then softened to the ground, and could no longer stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another dull vibration on the road, and the two ogres took a big step and followed the team to go forward. The buildings on both sides of the road are also full of shadows, and the nine-headed beasts are scattered into a line, running forward on both wings of the team. They show amazing agility, hopping to the roof from time to time, and then leaping into a dark alley. They are different from ordinary beasts, but have some wisdom. Richard can now put some simple instructions on them, including moving closer, freely moving, staying in a certain place, and attacking a specific enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the temple was less than 500 meters away, Richard kicked the horse again and began to speed up again. So the hoof is more dense, such as the thunder before the rainstorm. A brightly lit pub on the side of the road suddenly opened the door. Two drunken men came out. They were dressed in garrison uniforms. It should look like they were on duty tonight, but they were half drunk in the pub. They probed the street and wanted to see what was disturbing their carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the Mercedes-Benz team, a drunkard immediately opened his mouth and muttered, "Oh my God, what is it!" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other garrison is to be awake, far away to see the horror figure of the ogre, screaming on the spot: "It is the devil of the alien face! God, they actually went into the city, and they went to the alarm! Come on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to continue to shout, an arrow suddenly flies from the darkness Come, pierced his throat accurately and completely, and the rest of the shouts were sealed back. The other drunkard swayed, and did not figure out what had happened. A stepping knight had suddenly come to the fore. If a gust of wind swept past, the one-handed axe swept like this, this drunkard The garrison's head immediately flew high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team rushed from the front of the pub, and then the two ogres ran over, scaring the people in the pub to dispel any desire The idea of ​​going out of the door, the door was closed and the lights were extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance of the temple is already in sight. Two knights in golden ornate body armor stand straight on the long ladder and stand like two statues. They are only obedient, and only when they are on duty to guard the guards, they are qualified to wear the full body of the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha hangs the long knife on the side of the saddle, and does not stop, rushing to the temple ladder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guards of the Temple have discovered the enemies of the assault. One person raised his two-handed sword and the other shouted the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whistling wind, and two sharp arrows caught up behind Li, and directed two guards. Shouting the warning guard’s arrow in his face, he fell to the sky. Another guard who was guarded by God was blocked by a sword. After all, Oral is not a full-time shooter, and the second arrow's crosshairs and power will drop sharply during a fast burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the knights on both sides rushed faster than Richard, and they rushed up the ladder to the door of the temple, and swayed down the axe by the horse The temple guard suddenly flew backwards, and the breastplate had been cut open by two cracks, and blood sprang up. With a loud bang, he slammed into the door of the temple, then bounced and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
