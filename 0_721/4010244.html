			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard suddenly felt that his face was not painful, and instead With an unbearable itching. Not only the face, but also the injuries everywhere. For a time, there are thousands of ants crawling around in the body, unable to tell the uncomfortable. Richard couldn't help but reach out and touched his face. When he touched it, he found that the flesh and blood of the wound were squirming wildly, and suddenly he was shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but want to jump, but he was held down by the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't move, your injury will recover soon, and you will endure it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was experienced in the treatment of the gods. He immediately responded that the wound was recovering, so he relaxed his body in order to avoid wasting energy. However, the speed of wound recovery is too fast, as fast as the release of a cure by a powerful priest, and even some common magical healing can not be cured quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered that he had changed his mind and knew that it must be related to the giant egg brought by the mountain and the sea, so he curiously asked: "What egg is that?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl said with a relaxed face: "The egg of the Hydra lizard. I just passed through its nest and took out an egg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard can already be said to be well-informed, he still couldn’t help but breathe a cold air when he heard the name of the Hydra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of Warcraft that he only saw in the Dark Blue Library. The Hydra has a dragon's blood, but it doesn't fly like a normal dragon. They are endless, and they are known for their incomparable and powerful resilience. They are bigger than any dragon other than the legendary dragon. If you fight on the ground, even the dragons are not their opponents, and they are definitely among the landlords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea actually dare to steal the eggs of the Hydra lizard, no matter how relaxed her tone is, the process must be extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only egg of the Hydra lizard can have such a miraculous recovery effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was speechless, only sighed. He is becoming more and more powerful, but the various debts he owes are becoming more and more, and he does not know how to pay it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly smiled and smiled, and approached Richard, saying: "I have seen it, then, gift!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie's face changed, the body instinctively leaned back, but knew that it was impossible to escape, just do everything. The girl had already put on Richard, but she did not have the bite of the sneak in the expectation, but she touched her face with her lips. Richard did not respond, and the girl went to his arms and said, 'sleepy', and then a little whispered soft snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s hand was lifted and lowered, and finally, as in the past, he licked the girl’s head and let her sleep on her lap like that. With. Richard held her neck, helped her adjust her most comfortable posture, and then gently combed her full of hair, touching the shells, bones, stones and ornaments made of fangs, and savoring the feelings. The bleak and sullen atmosphere above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Li has changed, and the mountains and the sea have changed. She became less innocent and more sloppy and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, this night was very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwillingly, the day is still bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first line of the morning light shines on the body, the mountain and the sea are like a little lion that wakes up, stretched out and made a big fight. Yawn, sit up. The first thing that caught the eye was a face that was familiar with blood. The mountain and the sea immediately sipped in the mouth of Li, like a deep blue, and enjoyed a good taste. This is a wake-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at her eyes and looked around several times before she realized that it was not dark blue, so there was a faint glimmer in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took a pair of white jade shells from her head, took one of them, and placed them on Richard’s animal bracelet, and then put the bracelet Then wrap it back on Richard's wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have something to say to you, I will write it on this shell in my hand, and then the same will be on your shell. Appear. They can only be used once, but no matter which plane you are in, they can communicate." The girl said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and felt that the beast bracelet was heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should go back. The old men in the temple are very impatient." The girl waved her hand to Richard as she did a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said to the girl: "You have to be careful about those in the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"They are...good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl turned and left, Richard suddenly called her back: "At the appointed I don’t necessarily beat you, but I will beat everyone else!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea have turned back this time, leaving a big smile, then Going all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the back of the mountain and the sea, and the little scorpions on her head were still beating in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a sorrow in his heart, sorted out the equipment, and then adjusted himself to the best state, and ran to the place. After eating the egg of the Hydra lizard, his injuries have been restored overnight, and even the weakness of blood loss has never happened. The only painful left shoulder is the place where the black sands were killed and the energy of the palms of the black sands. This shows that the resilience of the Hydra lizard is strong enough to compete with high-level magic. If it is not a special wound, it will be restored. Just overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already made a few bad preparations, but he has never met an enemy. He returned to the Nelson family. Island territory. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the transmission line of Noland, the old patriarch of the family of the Nelson family ran over. When the old man saw Richard, he immediately regretted: "Oh, it’s a pity, I didn’t earn the 250,000 gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laughing, then grabbing the old man’s collar and swearing: "Old man! You already know the identity of the mountain and the sea, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course!" The old man laughed and slipped. "How can we not know who is the owner of Caledon like our family who runs two mainland trades? I was roughly guessed when I heard you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said: "Then you don't tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell you, you may not dare to go deep. But now it seems, Your trip is good, isn't it?" the old man said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily." But Richard also acknowledged that if he had known the identity of the mountains and the sea, he would meet on the mainland of Calando. To what, he will probably give up this trip, but wait a little longer, and then embark on Calando after the strength is improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip to the wild mainland is also a life of nine deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man seems to know the thoughts of Richard’s heart, and smiles and knows: “Some things, always have to know if there will be a miracle. When the imperial emperor of the millennium gave us an ultimatum, no one thought that we would win. Even even when I refused the ultimatum, I had no confidence at all. I only knew that this was a must."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was silent for a while, then Yan Yan said: "I will use your transmission array later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s eyes are bright, and he smiled and said: “Let me earn 250,000 yuan next time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the four lions lined up in a line, from the territory of the family of the Nelson family, and flew in the direction of FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the lions go away, the old man sighed and said, "Still with the young people, have energy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Richard returned to FS with four tired and exhausted griffins. After the long flight, the four griffins are close to collapse, but Richard is still in good spirits, except for the long-term maintenance of a posture, the limbs feel a little stiff, and there is no tiredness that has not fallen asleep for several days and nights. This is the remnant effect of Hydra's lizard. A lot of warmth sinks in the body, and under the impact of high-altitude gale, it rises a little and washes the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha returned to the family floating island, first called the old butler, asked about the recent situation of the floating island, and came to the latest situation report of each territory. Ready to take it to the ectopic face and look carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has returned from the mainland of Carando, but Faschi has still not returned. He thought about it and said to the old housekeeper: "Give a letter to Faschi, and say that I will return to the Greenson plane tomorrow, and then she can come back without hiding from me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master." The old butler agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and suddenly laughed and said, "Now the floating island still needs her. After she returns, you tell her, even if I suddenly return to the float The island will not go to her room. So she can't see it when she is hiding in the room. I didn't see her. I have never seen her."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler said: "You can rest assured. What special do you have to say about Miss Faschi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he said, but he shook his head and said: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the seven suits, it is not a special matter, Richard only repays Ellie’s support during the turbulent period. So he does not intend to mention this matter again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
