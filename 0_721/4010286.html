When there are more trivial things to deal with, people will always have such emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the study are still full of scoring, messy, just like Richard’s current mood. However, the word left by the white night was very eye-catching in a mess. Richard simply stood by the wall and carefully grasped the artistic conception in the word. Slowly, under the murderous encouragement, his mood finally calmed down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the documents on the desk, there is a small, delicate high-profile crystal cup with four black diamonds. That is the shadow drill left by Richard after killing four shadow creatures. It is extremely rare, and few people can recognize this kind of valuable treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so busy in the day that he forgot all these things and threw it on the desk at will, or the careful old housekeeper took it Put it out, put it in the container and put it on the desk. This is also the basic quality of the attendants. Paper that has not been thrown into the trash can never be cleaned up. Unfamiliar items will not be thrown away even if they seem useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only glanced at the shadow drill and prepared to put them into his pocket. But he suddenly snorted and his eyes fell back to the crystal cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shadow drill and the crystal cup, there are very few traces of traces. If it is not the sharpness of Richard's eyes, it is almost impossible to notice. These traces are instantly restored in Richard's mind, slowly expanding into a fingerprint and a half palm print, and the direction and formation process of the connection are displayed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These few shadow diamonds seem to be held in the palm of your hand, and then reluctantly put it back. The man's movements seemed to be extremely cautious, and there were only a few faint curves that were finally glued. The traces were new and had not been contaminated by dust. It should not be long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting back to his desk, Richard pulled the bell to summon the attendant. After a while, the door was gently ringed, and a maid came in and respectfully asked, "What do you mean by Richard,"?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li When she looked up at her, she continued to process the documents and said faintly: "When you call Faschi, you say that I am back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok." The maid took a ritual and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, bring this to the butler." Richard called the maid, got up and left the table, coming to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid was slightly covered and extended her hands to pick up the documents in the hands of Richard. But Richard's hand suddenly stopped in the air, and then came his faint voice: "Your neck is very beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck of the maid’s neck is almost Stand up in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the electro-optical surge in Richard’s body instantly turned into a myriad of fragments, and a bone dagger emerged from it. Richard’s hand still seems to keep moving slowly, but brings out a shadow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid didn’t even have time to get up straight, and the body suddenly shot The dark gray vindictiveness, such as the fog of the early winter night, immediately surrounds the chest and abdomen, and it is necessary to cover the whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard's hand fell steadily, and the short sword penetrated the maid's belly accurately and without error! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is like stagnation in an instant, and the short sword in Richard's hand is shaking violently. In an instant, Richard did not know how many swords were stabbed, but now he can only control the scope of the sword as much as possible, and not let each sword fall at the same point as the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark gray fog is still spreading, the two sides are almost close to each other, and can even hear each other's breathing and heartbeat. But even at such a close distance, the figure of the maid in the vision of Richard has disappeared, the fog is rolling, not thick, and the background of the room can be seen through the fog. The human body just close to it seems to have no presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not hesitate and seduce, and the short sword in his hand kept keeping his sword and sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dagger is still, the time continues to flow forward. The fog suddenly disappeared, as if it had never appeared before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid is still standing there, but the position of both sides has been changed in one direction. She bowed her head and saw a thick bloody mist in the abdomen. There was a horrible hollow there, and everything inside was broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vindictiveness of her body was lost in an instant. If it wasn’t for Richard’s short sword, it would not even stand. She barely looked up at Richard and said in a clearly changed voice: "How do you... see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the shoulder of the maid, Lest she really fall on herself, then smile and say: "You shouldn't move the shadow drill on my desk. It is impossible for a maid and a housekeeper to recognize that kind of thing. In addition, the sound of your knocking on the door has changed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound of knocking on the door? How can you remember the sound of a maid knocking on the door?" The maid widened her eyes in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I can really remember." Richard replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid’s eyes are fierce, and they say, “But you...we’t be too proud!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Licha laughs: "This is what I want to say. I have lost patience with these guys. You can rest assured that I know nothing from your mouth, but I will remember you and identify you. And put your kins in my target of attack and destruction. You don't have to look at me like this, I just want to use you as an example, tell those who have ulterior motives, whoever wants to kill me, whoever has to pay The price of the genocide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a ... tyrant..." The waitress finally showed horror in his eyes, cursing with resentment, and the glory in his eyes was quickly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, you have no chance to blame me in court." Richard said faintly, then took a step back and let the maid's body fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li pulled the bell again, and after a moment the old butler came in and saw the bloody scene and was immediately taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a killer, I have been killed by me. As for the original maid, at this moment the body is mostly hidden in the corner of the castle, send someone to search Castle. Looking for someone to drag the body away and hand it to Agamemnon, he has the means to find out the identity of the killer. Also ask someone to clean up the study." Li told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper took the lead. After a few moments, several guards and waiters entered the study, towed the body and cleaned the blood on the ground. Richard quickly reviewed the documents after his desk, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the door of the study was ringed again, and Faschi walked in with a light hand. Richard looked up and smiled at her and said, "My memory is not very good recently. Some things can't be remembered for a while. Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fas Qi smiled and said, "I'm sorry, I... I shouldn't hide from you, let the killer get into your study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing a charming smile, said: "The ability to send such a killer is not enough, indicating that my enemies are already unable to sit. Every day I live, they will let them fall into fear of being unable to extricate themselves. But such a thing I I don't want to see too much. I have become more and more impatient recently. I think it's time to give some guys a lesson and let them wake up. Don't think that I have forgotten anything."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi suddenly felt that Richard became strange, strange and terrible. And she was very uncomfortable standing in the room at the moment, not because of the bloody suffocation left in the air, but because she didn't know where it was from the thorns of her entire consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen the murderer’s body of a fake maid, a 16-level killer who is good at camouflage and escapes and is a very dangerous character. In many cases, his danger is not much lower than a Sanctuary assassin. But how did Richard see her disguise? And killing her in an understatement, how did he do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Faschi’s perception of killing became clearer and clearer, and the orientation was also coming out. The cold hair of her neck was suddenly turned upside down and she turned back lightly. I finally saw the wall full of nicks next to the bookshelf, and the life of the row on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Night?" Faschi cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, only the life of the line is left behind by the night, the rest is my work." Richard's voice from Faschi Coming behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi looked at the knife marks on the wall again, and the heart was cold again. She has seen that the knife marks are almost on the wall at the same time. In the face of such violent storms, even if it is just slashing, Faschi feels that it will be very difficult to cope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, from the nick, the attack power of each knife is not high, this is the only place that makes her feel better. If you are attacking Faschi himself, you may be able to move the position at a less expensive price and try to pull back. Thinking of this, her heart moved slightly, it seems that she understood that the killer was almost killed without any trace of resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a copy from the documents on the table and handed it to Faschi, saying, "Look, I’m posting a message, ready to publicly After the recruitment of the candidate knights by the Kmund family, there are many free Archimonde fighters responding. I think there will be more time in the period. Therefore, I want to make changes to the original plan. First, I am planning to expand the recruitment. In addition to the candidate knights, there are a lot of enrollment knights to be recruited. All the more than 10 or more free Archimonde fighters who are under 35 years old can sign up. The second is the new step knight treatment. It will be implemented with reference to the average level of the seventh floor floating island giants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi was shocked and said quickly: "Licha, you know the reference to the floating island giants. What does the average mean? Even if it is only the seventh floor, you will go bankrupt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
