			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deepest part of the world at the bottom of the abyss, the man who blocked Richard’s way, has taken control of all the rules of the abyss. In this respect, Richard is at best the same level as him. To achieve even the weakest advantage, he can only start from the rules of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abis Abyss is also part of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half a year in the past, Richard no longer explores new planes, but wanders around in the void. His current range of perception is far more than ever, and he can transmit the past directly where he perceives it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Richard spent another half a year exploring the myriad of dangerous places. There are no more secrets such as the Star God Palace, the Star of Destruction, the Stream of Mars, the Cemetery of the Giants, and so on. Richard even tried to approach the torrent of time, but eventually realized that it was not the area where life could be involved, and had to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now, Richard has a new conjecture about the Eternal and Time Dragon. This omnipotent old dragon may not be a tangible life, but a unique will born in the torrent of time. This is a shocking conjecture, but Richard also knows that this conjecture cannot be verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year has passed, and Richard returns to Noland, putting together the book of Time and the Book of Destruction. Sure enough, as in the prophecy, the two artifacts merged together and turned into a thick bronze book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing it at first sight, Richard knows its name: The Book of Eternity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of Eternal has many uses, it can provide coordinates to the holder in any environment, thus preventing loss. It seems to be able to influence the established destiny, but only the principle, even Richard can not understand. Finally, the book of Eternity can earn a certain income according to the will of the holder and thus remain forever. As long as the book of Eternity is not destroyed, the life and soul preserved there will not be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard came to the library of the ancient star family. Looking at the old and powerful experimental platform, he suddenly stopped and didn't know what to do. This lab has its own limitations, it can parse the rules, but there is nothing to do with the rules of the bottom of the world, and what Richard needs now is the underlying rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this experimental platform, Richard also knows his true strength today. From the point of view of rule control, it is placed in the extinct ancient star family, and Richard is also a rare supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are many secrets in this library that are worth exploring. Richard walked into a protective mask, took out a crystal inside, and began to study the knowledge and rules recorded therein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records in the Star Library have no insurmountable obstacles for Richard. He read it one by one, and soon finished reading all the books, except for the light at the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the light and wanted to reach out and touch, but hesitated and took it back. The force field that protects the light has stopped Richard, which means that Richard has the ability to touch it. But now Richard knows what this light is, it is pure light, nothing else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light, if touched, deteriorates. The rules it represents are of little use to Richard. Richard even couldn't figure out why the ancient star family would place such a light here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this light is never ordinary, it is because it is pure and innocent, so it is extremely precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there for seven days, and did not want to understand how the ancient stars fixed the light. This has even surpassed Richard's current rules of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard gave up on the study of this light. However, he can be sure that this ancient library should be the supreme inheritance of the entire star family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Faust, he suddenly felt open-minded, as if the whole world was in his heart! He took a long breath and knew the way of the strong. It was the end of the moment and he could no longer move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard has crossed the realm of the super-powerful, reaching the realm that Noland has never been able to reach. In the records of the ancient star family, such as Richard, the name is the peak of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in this world, Richard has really reached its peak. If you want to go further, you may only go to the dark side of the world to find opportunities, or even find ways to break the world and see if there is a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard returned to the floating island of Archimonde, standing in the control hall, overlooking the floating world, this luxurious and legendary capital. After a moment, Li sighed and looked up at the void, faintly said: "How are you there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly twisted and appeared A mirror-like light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light curtain is the battlefield of the fierce battle, and countless Heavenly Warriors are fighting in the dead. At this time, there was a six-winged warrior on the screen. He was not particularly strong, but always felt more dazzling than other fighters. The six-winged heavenly people should have dazzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This six-winged warrior wielded a burning sword, killed several enemies, and then looked at Richard and said: As you can see, it is very bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This celestial warrior is actually St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his answer, Richard smiled and his eyes fell on the six light wings behind Martin, saying: "They are already six wings. The upgrade was fast enough. Why didn't I see that you had something bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin swayed the sword and cut down a spurt of enemies , gasping and said: "You guys will say cool words! I have to lose, where will it be? I am not like these hateful guys, can be resurrected after death, if I die here, that is true Dead. No matter how you miss me in the future, I will not appear again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this sentence, Richard thoughtfully said: "If this is the case, it seems to be a good thing for the world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! How did I know?" You are such a guy with no conscience!" Martin sneered at Richard's middle finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha double eyebrows wrinkled and said: "I am serious! I don't know why there is such a feeling. I always feel that you guys are dead in heaven." It will be good for the whole world! The intuition of a mage like me is usually the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!..." Martin seems to be angry. After speaking, after cutting down a few opponents, I said, "To tell the truth, I also think that you feel right. But you suddenly think of looking for me, not just to tell me this?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally thought that there is something that is right for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha! Is it a gift? This idea is good, I have not received it for a long time. I have been to a gift. But obviously, I have to wait for me to win this damn war, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frown asked: " What kind of war is this about? Why did you suddenly rush to the heavens to fight? Is there any other thing in your glorious church that has nothing to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is a war about faith! You don't understand this when you say this, but anyway, you only need to know that this is the same thing as saying that you have to fight with the reaper. This war is coming to me. Say it must be played, and must win, even if it is dead, it does not matter!" Martin said, while struggling to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin continues to cut down the enemy, but the enemies around him are more and more, there are quite a lot of four-winged angels, these guys rush in groups Come, although Martin is a six-wing, he is also suppressed for a while and has almost no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your situation is really not very good. Would you like me to help you?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a jihad! It is a war that belongs only to believers in the light! There is no need for outsiders to intervene!" Martin screamed and his face shone with the name Sacred and The light of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s heart resonated and was awe-inspiring, Martin’s mouth suddenly turned and hurriedly said: “Although this is a holy war, In order to win this war that must be won, it is forgivable to use the power of friends occasionally. Richard, don't look at it, come over! I can't hold it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Martin’s impetuous voice, Richard only felt that he could hardly pick up. He opened his mouth and said something for a long time: "I am going to the dark side of the world right away, so I can't get through myself. But I can give you some help in other ways. For example, this..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the book of Eternity, a beam of light shot from the pages of the book, through the air, appearing in front of St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pale gold spot, which quickly outlines a regular tetrahedron in the air, then turns into a solid, and grows bigger, in Martin The top of the head is slowly rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
