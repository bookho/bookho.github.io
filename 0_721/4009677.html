			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, Richard’s learning is fireball, and it’s in one At the level, I learned fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball is a legendary three-level magic, and in the first three levels of magic, its status is like the deep blue Su Hailun, are unique existence. There are many legends and proverbs about fireball. The most common one is that the wizard who only slams the fireball is not a good mage. However, no matter which angle the proverb understands, it actually recognizes the special and unique nature of fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of this sentence is that fireball is too important for low-level magicians, just because of the fireball, let those six Lower level magicians below the level have a place in the war, no longer a role that can be completely ignored. When each mage has just been promoted to level 5 and can study three levels of magic, he will basically choose fireball as the first spell to study. Fireball is not a long three-second spell, the basic range of 30 meters, the range of damage of 10 meters in diameter, and the minor injury of the lucky soldier in the range of damage, the serious injury of ordinary soldiers and the damage of the deadly warrior, let it stand out All the magic of the level. The warrior here refers to the warrior with the same level or less as the magician. This makes the magician with fireball skill possess the killing weapon against the low-level warrior. At this stage, the warrior can only choose one sword and one sword. The magician is not too risky to say, and often does not end well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s because of the power of fireball so that the extreme phenomenon of low-level magicians’ hardships of fireballs appeared in a certain period of time. The production of this proverb. The pinnacle of the development of fireball research is a magic note published by an eight-level magician: "On the possibility of five fireballs killing a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a history-changing note with all the elements that are widely circulated, including sensational headlines, logic that can withstand scrutiny, and conclusions that are surprising. In fact, the original title of this note is 'A preliminary study of the superposition effect of fireball in closed space'. The conclusion is that when twelve fireballs are simultaneously cast, it is difficult for the 18th level magister to resist the superimposed damage. Under extreme conditions, for example, the 18th-level magician has unfortunately produced a critical strike effect on every fireball, just in a special closed space, when the station is at the focus of the reflected energy, in theory, as long as Five fireballs are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic note was unknown at first, but in a good deed, the title was changed to "Five Fireballs!" After that, it immediately became popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the Magisters is that, in addition to the title with ulterior motives, the premise of this magic note is clear, logically rigorous, and accurate, that is, Its conclusion is correct, although this conclusion has little practical significance. Which magician will stay in a tightly calculated enclosed space and let five fireball mages bombard? Moreover, the magical power of the magician and the control of the magic power will make the critical strike and extreme effect of low-level spells such as fireball almost impossible. The most extreme conditions plus a series of coincidences will have a five-fire effect. But the low-level wizards and more people who know nothing about magic will manage this. There are only five fireballs in their eyes to kill the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is irritating but helpless. If a magician goes to debate the logic of the five fireballs with the lower-level wizards, it is stupid in itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singularity of magical research is indeed detrimental to the prosperity of magic itself. So at that time, led by a big magister, led dozens of mages and hundreds of apprentices, spent nearly three years doing a lot of investigations and research, and finally came up with a report, the conclusion is over-exploration of fireball After that, there will be a certain proportion of magicians encountering additional difficulties in the future promotion, and even serious will affect the magic height that the wizards can finally reach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as this article came out, the Fireball Masters suddenly became amazed. Numerous doubts have been directed at the statistics in the report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that these statistics are illogical and illogical, but in addition to it, the low-level fireball wizards can't find other data for reference. It is even less likely that there are enough resources to collect the raw data by themselves. Therefore, both supporters and opponents have to quote the statistics in the report to support their own assertions. Quoted too much, these statistics become real. If the reality is contrary to these data, then it must be a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball Masters are indignant in any way, and ultimately can only accept reality. And in the midst of anger, they are really afraid to influence their own promotion. The big magister is not very backup in itself, but he represents the consensus of the high-level wizards, and this class actually determines the future of the fireball wizards. So the situation of the fireball sea has slowly changed. For the development of the magic civilization itself, this is actually a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the whole process finally proves another thing, that is, the number of mages is not important, and the level determines everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reason why fireball is fireball is that no matter how people treat it objectively or extremely, it is always a special one. Even if the 20th-level magister is on the battlefield, facing the thousands of ordinary soldiers, I am afraid that the first reaction is to throw a fireball out. And after years of repeated research, all the super magic skills, including magic efficiency, magical effects, magic speed, magic instant, magical silence, spell upgrade, precise control, spell delay... all have fireballs The special study of surgery, this is not only the first three levels of magic, but also no one of the first five levels of magic can be compared with fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the storm surrounding the fireball gradually subsided, the low-ranking wizard who caused the debate was called the 'Five Fireball Master', and the real name was instead People are gradually forgetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By benefiting from the rich collection of books in Deep Blue, Richard also learned the complex history behind this spell when he learned the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of a whole month, only magical taxonomy, low-level magic entry and meditation are directly related to magic, only three days. The introduction of low-level magic is also a magician. The content of the lectures is more about the theory of element balance. The spells, gestures and the casting of various low-level magics are completely passed, just let the students make their own magic books. Learn. After nearly a month of study, Richard has found that the magicians taught by Deep Blue have the common characteristics, that is, to talk about the theory, the more purely theoretical things, the more they talk, and the actual magic casting skills. I am completely dismissive and I am too lazy to explain. Most of them require students to practice and comprehend themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change places, the magician who teaches this class will definitely be considered a liar, or at least a low-energy wizard who knows nothing about empty talk. But in the dark blue, the theory is placed in a very high position, and the theoretical research is done well, which is a shortcut to please Su Hailun. And in addition to teaching the old master of history, the class is at least a 14-level master magician, this level is already high enough to block all doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is learning fireball from the magic book that was sent to his hand. In fact, the firing and manipulation of fireball is not complicated. The main reason for being classified as a third-level magic is the higher demand for basic magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the day after class, in addition to the necessary meditation, Richard is constantly practicing magic. He spent fifteen days mastering all six level 0 general-purpose magic, and then continued to be proficient. While proficient in level 0 magic, Richard also flipped through the entire contents of one to three levels of magic in order to have a systematic understanding of low-level magic, so that you can choose your first level of magic. Wisdom talent plays a role all the time, and Richard finds that his understanding of low-level magic is fast and thorough. Basically, after reading it several times, he will have the most basic understanding. It is in this process that Richard’s unexpected discovery is a simple fireball as a three-level magic, even simpler than some level one magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
