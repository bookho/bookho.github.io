			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Richard and Wolin went out from the Temple of Transmission Follow the beautiful tree-lined road to the eternal dragon temple on the top of the mountain. This is a road that is several kilometers long, but the pleasant scenery along the way makes people who walk on this road feel long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still alone, Wolin has brought four servants, and his clothes have a striking Archimonde of Akmen. There are many people on the tree-lined roads. There are a full set of shiny armored knights, and there are many gorgeous carriages, but more are pedestrians. As the most extensive sanctuary of Noland's faith, the Eternal Dragon Hall has a large number of believers. The eternal dragon temple can not be rebuilt, and only the features that can be found have laid a more sacred position among believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a kilometer of the Eternal Dragon Hall, everyone, including the bloodthirsty Philip of the Allied Emperor, will abandon the car and walk to the Eternal Dragon Hall to Demonstration of the eternal and timeless dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Wolin talked all the way to the Dragon Hall. After all, Wolin has lived in FS for a year, knowing much more than Richard. Just listening to the secrets of the 14th Giants and the Royal Family is enough to kill the time on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they turned a corner and was about to walk on the road leading to the Eternal Dragon Hall, they suddenly walked out of the group from the opposite side. The laughing aristocratic youth also took five or six servants. In the middle of this group of people, there is a youth surrounded by stars and stars. An elegant and luxurious dress shows the identity and the taste of the old-fashioned giants. The most important thing is that the badges of the three long swords crossed in the chest of the Chinese costume illustrate his identity, the direct children of the Joseph family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard knew almost nothing about the grievances of Joseph and Archimonde, but Wolin suddenly changed his face, snorted, and strode a few steps. Just in the way of the group of people marching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of aristocratic youths was a glimpse first, and then they immediately showed up. Wolin's move was already a provocation, so the servants who followed them immediately stepped forward and forced them up, rolled up their sleeves and prepared for the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four servants who followed Wolin were slightly inferior in quantity and size, but without fear. But not fearing is not equal to stupidity. There is already a servant who turns around and is ready to return to the family castle to report. This conflict seems to be difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fokker, do you seem to have a good time these days?" Wolin squeezed this out of his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic youth who were surrounded by the opposite side saw Wolin, who stopped laughing, first laughed a little, then said in an exaggerated gesture: This is not the young Woolin younger at Archimonde? Haha, I have had a good time in recent days, Thor is on, I made a big profit in the casino first, and I also won back a piece that is said to be The heirloom of an ancient elf tribe! And today I have just heard a very amazing news. Do you want to know what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around Fokker The young people immediately questioned, and the eagerness seemed to be waiting for the gods of the gods. And Wolin's face was obviously blue, because the heirloom of the ancient elf was his output. As for what Fokker wants to say, he still doesn't know it yet, but thinking about it will not be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally standing behind Wolin, frowning at Fogg and the group of people around him, countless numbers violently jumping first, then the jump began to change Small, many key data gradually become clear. From the range of changes in the movements of Fokker and others, it is possible to reversely speculate on the approximate range of their main combat power, just as Richard can calculate the magic from the fluctuation of the magical atmosphere of a legal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Fokker is a comrade between the tenth and the twelfth, and the ranks of those servants are mostly between eight and ten. As for the young people around Fokker, there is no fighting power, and the strong is similar to Wolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a shot of Wolin’s shoulder and said, “Let’s go, go to the Eternal Dragon Hall!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the situation is really hands-on, it is not necessary to say that Wolin and Richard are the result of being beaten. Six powerful servants, plus Fokker, even if Richard completely learned the skills of the dark world is useless. Richard is not a warrior, but also a one-to-many, wanting to solve seven intermediate battles in a frontal battle, unless the eternal dragon puts the grace of God on his head. As for magic, such a close distance is a cofferdam. How can there be room for Magic to cast magic? He also has no magic tools such as a wand that can store instant spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time it was Wolin’s provocation. According to the rules of the nobility, this beggar must be a white fight, and it will become a laughing stock for some time to come. . Richard does not like to be beaten for no reason, especially the relationship between him and Wolin is not so good to the extent of the same retreat. In fact, there is no friendship at all, just the connection between the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallin turned back and rushed to Richard and said: "What do you know, this kid is a Joseph family! It is the third son of the Duke of Joseph, and the most An annoying one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie's face changed, he took back his hand on Wolin's shoulder and stepped back. Richard had little interest in the hatred of the Archimonde family, and the situation was clearly that Wolin was in trouble. From Fokker’s words, he could hear the cause of the incident and the hatred between the two families was not too much. Relationship, but more like the vindictiveness of young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Richard does not like being used by people, including Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the opposite Fokker saw enough of the play, chuckled and said: "It is said that after the loss of that day, a guy ran to the garden Go find a woman. Afterwards, guess, what did Lansie say? The guy only insisted for five minutes! And his guy is even smaller than the goblin! Haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The young people around Fogg immediately laughed loudly. In their view, the bed was another battlefield, sometimes even more important than the plane war. And Wolin's face has turned red and turned purple, and he screamed with a change of tone: "Fokker! Who are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;福In the eyes of the gram, there was a glimmer of light, saying: "I am talking about a small hybrid of a hybrid woman! Why, do you have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wallin screamed and rushed to Fogg, slamming his fist to Fokker's face! Wolin was an archer and his movements were quick. Richard didn't even react, and he had already rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! A dull voice, Wolin's fist slammed on Fokker's face and beat him up and leaned back. Fokker didn't even evade, and hardened his own face to take a punch! However, Fokker's physical strength is in full compliance with the tenth-level warrior's identity. After a punch, he slowly straightens his body and does not step back! Although Wolin was not known for his strength, the full punch also made Fokker's left face swollen quickly, and the circle of the eyes was filled with large bruises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fokke stared at Wolin with a squint and revealed a distorted smile, saying, "Mixed! I have been waiting for you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
