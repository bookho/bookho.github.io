			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Baron Fontaine also informed Richard that the Duke had sent a team of elites The knight, led by a Sanctuary strongman, is already on the way to the dusk castle. Their main task is to escort the mysterious structure of Richard's hand back. At that time, Richard can follow the team of knights to ensure the safety of the journey. Although it is not a war period, the contradiction between the true God church and the ancestors worshiping the nobility is already on the verge, and armed conflict is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room that Baron arranged for Richard was large and gorgeous, and the beautiful window view was outside the floor-to-ceiling window. This room is not far from Richard's men, and everything is considered very thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when Richard lay in bed, he didn’t know why, and it’s hard to fall asleep. In his heart, there is another kind of uneasiness that is tumbling, making him unable to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on? Is Fang Dan wanting to kill me?" Richard frowned. That uneasiness implied killing, it seems that there is a sharp edge after the night, always ready to break through. However, the enthusiasm and sincerity of Baron Fontaine is by no means a masterpiece. This point is also discerned by Richard. There is no more defensive power in the castle. When Richard walked inside the castle, he did not feel the extra force arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of uneasiness should not be an instinct for being in a strange territory. If you say the power of guards, although the square baron is dominant, it is only superficial. The power of it. Both Sandru and Richard can summon magical creatures continuously, and the real power of the water is not measurable by the level of the tenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the Richards also have the sand flowing through the book of Time. After the dawning title is advanced, the number of reels that can be used for sand drifting is greatly increased. As long as the magic scroll is not used, she is almost a treatment machine that will never be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where does this danger come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee sat up, dressed, and took the long knife out of the scabbard, placed within reach, and then in consciousness All magic contractors have issued orders that require vigilance. At the same time, he contacted his mother's nest, allowing him to immediately go to the baron's territory and the edge of the mountains to stand by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at a slow speed of 10 kilometers per hour at the parent's nest, it is impossible to get to the battlefield support in time. Only let it ambush in advance to the designated location, clear out a back road, wait for the breakout to go to the meeting, and also give the soldiers a fatal blow, if the situation is bad to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of danger is getting stronger and stronger. This is intuition, but for a magician like Richard, the effect of intuition is very obvious. There must be a reason for such a strong intuition, but it is impossible to find out now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the message of Richard, Gangde, Shuihua, etc. got up, put on the equipment, and prepared for all the battles. The splashes quietly entered the sand-sand room, informing her that she was also prepared, while staying there to protect the only and vital priest in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp outside the castle, the two ogres turned over and they rudely wrestled the knights and made them as alarming as possible. Under the premise of the castle defenders, they will summon their own soldiers and prepare for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first night of contact between the forces of Richard and the Duke of the Wolf. Before the attitude of Baron Fontaine was thoroughly understood, all the soldiers were originally They are all sleeping in armor. At that time, as long as you grab the weapon, you can fight by drilling out the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening of the day, the sunset of the red sky was still too late to fall into the mountains. A young hunter is moving back to Bran Village in a brisk pace. His shoulders are full of prey, and today's harvest is very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mountain is not too flat, and there have been many giant wolves that have never been seen before. Experienced hunters are reluctant to face the two beasts of bears and wolves, and young people are no exception. He hopes to return to the village before dark, and the forest after the night is too dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the village is far away, young hunters can't help but speed up. But suddenly he had a flower in front of him, and there was a beautiful woman who could not even meet in her dreams. Looking at the woman's almost complete body, the eyes of the young hunter are completely straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lord of this village is called Richard?" asked the beautiful and beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha? No, ah! Yes, he is our new lord. Called Richard. A..." The young hunter’s thoughts became very dull. No matter what the eyes can't do without the woman's chest, it's better not to know the answer to the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just him! Baby, come, help me ask where the little Richard is going now?" The beautiful woman turned to the side and said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a huge lion head suddenly appeared in front of the young hunter, this lion head is almost as big as his upper body! The lion lion opened his mouth wide and bit the young hunter's head with his shoulder and chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the lion's eyes shot two lights and outlined an image in the air. In the image, a young magician is riding on the horse and patrolling Bran Village. Although the image is slightly blurred, the appearance of the young magician can still be seen, and Hinklel naturally recognizes Richard at a glance. Before she came to the Faro plane, she saw Richard's magical image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the memory of young hunters, Richard is obviously more mature than calm in Noland, adding a lot of weight and depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! The little guy who is very beautiful, it has become more flavorful now! Be sure to use it!" When saying these words, Cinclair is almost smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of the lions quickly dimmed, and the images taken from the souls of young hunters disappeared. The image of just half a minute has already made this huge lion look languid. However, Sinclair is now very excited, grabbing the lion's mane and whispering in his ear: "You can definitely find out the taste of Richard, isn't it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion whispered to show approval. Then its gaze looked at Bran Village not far away, and did not mean to scream twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair slammed the lion and said, "The people in the village, how much you want to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, Hinckler rides on the back of the lion and leaves Bran Village. Behind her, follow all the remaining town bear knights and two great magicians. They went all the way north, along the road that Richard had traveled, and went straight to the dusk castle of Baron Fontaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small village Bran is in absolute silence, all the lights are extinguished, the black mist haunts every corner of the village, and there is a thick liquid from The half-covered door flows out. But those sputum-flowing liquids are not the dark red of the blood, but they are as dark as the strongest night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
