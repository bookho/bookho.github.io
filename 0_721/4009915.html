			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind blade comes out, the wind teeth jumped down the stone and returned The camps, each found their place to sit down, and then they screamed in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten different wind teeth with special magic colors, which can be clearly distinguished at night, so there is immediate order in the chaotic camp. The half-orcs, barbarians and sand people found their own teeth, gathered in the past, and arranged the queue in the shortest time. Each team of fighters is led by a step knight or a captain, who directs the battle, but the choice of the target is specified by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the whole team, Gangde and the two ogres have roared to meet the cavalry team, and the extraordinary strength allows them to fearlessly The cavalry below the level collided in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big axe in the hands of Gangde spurs magical power from time to time. This is a giant axe from the double-headed dragon, and it can be easily taken as long as it is rounded up. Take the cavalry in front of you and the war horse! The new weapon has greatly increased the lethality of this strong man and became a real meat grinder in the group battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the three-pronged and tiramisu's double hammer power is also not much better, Tiramisu still remembers his magician duty In advance, he and his brother blessed the power of the bull and the stone skin. This is a simple and effective strategy, and the increase in offensive and defensive means a direct increase in combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them are like three reefs, firmly in the torrent of the hoof. The cavalry that was hitting the sharp corner collapsed like a catastrophe, but more cavalry rolled past them and went straight to the camp still in chaos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of magical light balls entwined with gray-black blasts, this is the intensified fear of the Necromancer. This magic caused a mess of more than a dozen knights, and slightly blocked their momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the figure of the water flower appeared quietly against the stone wall, and she suddenly made a sharp scream, and the strong breath spread with the voice in all directions. However, the effect was limited. Only a dozen horses that were close to her were frightened. The people stood up and blocked the charge of the knights behind. If you look closely, you can see that the ears of the horses and horses have been blocked by the cloth. Obviously this is the experience of using blood and life in the previous encounters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Splash is not completely unrecognized, just between one step and one retreat, her long knife flickering, killing two fell to the feet The cavalry then quickly retreated and re-entered the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry of the brigade refused to pay attention to the girl, but continued to rush to the camp. The first few horses leaped high and trampled down to the crowd! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-handed swords in the hands of the two Knights were picked up by lightning, and they opened the horses and horses that jumped into the air. The horses screamed, lost their balance, and fell heavily on the ground, but the position of the drop was the most crowded place, and several sand-stricken soldiers who could not be avoided were pressed under them. Under such a heavy blow, those Saudi soldiers are obviously more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more cavalry rushed into the camp. At this time, three consecutive fireballs were shot from Richard’s hand, and they fell into a line. After the blast, a 10 meter wide, 30 meter long blank was forcibly cut in the cavalry torrent! The lethality is not so simple. The horse's ears are stuffed but the eyes are not blindfolded. The flame still shocks the nearest horse, causing several small whirlpools on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap was immediately caught by the team on the side of Richard. The two winds led thirty barbarian warriors and half-orc warriors to form a strong flesh-and-blood defense. They used their strong body to hit the cavalry with great inertia, though In an instant, there were more than a dozen people who vomited blood and flew back, but finally stopped the momentum of the assault cavalry charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two fangs are carrying the sandmen’s cavalry who have just been launched, and one left and one right to the gap that Richard just bombarded with fireball, immediately Separate the former third of the attacking knight from the main body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the back of the camp, the rest of the winds continue to lead the soldiers throughout the team, in less than a few minutes, will form a strict and complete battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse thieves, although brave and good at war, but in the well-equipped, disciplined, tightly formed regular army, will eventually fall into the object of being slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru kept chanting the spell, and one black warrior came out of the summoning line. He did not let the black warrior immediately attack, but waited for three black warriors to be summoned to form a small team, and after the magic was added, they were allowed to pounce on the enemy. This is also the idea of ​​Richard, and it has been verified in actual combat. The black warriors who form the triangle formation are on the ordinary enemy and are completely a slow-moving killing machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are low and melodious songs in people’s ears, fast and low rhythms, passionate melodies, summoning the deepest forces in people’s hearts, so The soldiers are more eager to fight, their reactions are more agile, and the killing is more powerful. The various battle songs that can stimulate the potential and suppress the enemy are the reasons why the bards can exist on the battlefield, although this reason is somewhat far-fetched. But the Elf Warsong made Oral indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of the Elven Warsong is rare, and only the elf sacrifices can be mastered in the past. The first-level Elf Warsong can increase strength and agility by about 10%. On the battlefield, this is a huge bonus to the overall combat power. And Oral did not know where to learn the Elf Warsong, the rich blood of the Elf made his Warsong effect only slightly worse than the real Elf sacrifice, the improvement rate was stable at around 8%. Elf Warsong's coverage is fifty meters, which is much broader than the range state magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s presence, the soldiers are close to 500. Now, Oral’s contribution to the team’s real-time combat has exceeded that of anyone. Only when the sand is flowing in the future, and Richard will be promoted to a few levels, and learn a wide range of magic and post-surgery, can you overwhelm the elf poet in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly commanded, and the magic was also shot in all directions. Basically, all kinds of auxiliary magic, on the battlefield of nearly a thousand people fighting and killing, not to mention five fierce wolves, that is, fifty are difficult to reverse the battle. Every second, Richard must observe the battlefield, analyze the data, give orders to the contractors with soul connections, and move the troops by mobilizing the wind. More often, he needs to rely on shouting to achieve his goal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Richard’s meticulous command, the war quickly turned from chaos to stability, and then from stability to faint advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful strength of Richard’s side began to escalate. There were already three groups of nine black warriors rushing in the field, and Sander was summoning the fourth group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres have already killed the fierceness, running in the crowd, entangled with one another after strong physical strength and heavy weapons. Battle situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is bloody in the whole body. After most of the incoming cavalry rushed into the camp, he will return to the side of Richard, no matter how aggressive the enemy’s attack is. I have never stepped back and poured a whole lap of body in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
