At the door, it just blocked his way, but it seemed to have no way to give way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina." Richard looked at the Master of the Dragon in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Master's face is very complicated, so he looked at Richard, but still did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly realized the meaning of the Dragon Master, so he said helplessly: "Lina, do you want me to give up this territory? At least the pillars of the lord, the land of Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s face was awkward and asked: "The territory, ah, what territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at her for a moment, then sighed helplessly and said, "You... well, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned around and called: "Sorrel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Girl Bounced from the ground, rushed to the front of Richard, standing up, his face was full of excitement, his chest was undulating, her eyes were all looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her seriously, and after a moment she gave up the idea of ​​telling whether her expression was true or not, and Richard could not find Sosrel. The slightest flaw, even the use of analysis can not be done, but as long as she thought of what she had done to her sister, Richard always felt that she would not be so simple and cowardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she is really just impulsive, but more likely to be a very great actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a shot of her head and said, "Go to my private plane, I will give you a small army as your At the end of the class, you use it to get your own price out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel immediately jumped up, his face full of excitement and joy:" You don't want me to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said: "I know that you are mostly acting, but since I can't see it, then even if you win, I will give you a chance and will give you a trust, but you have to remember, my trust. Not for you, but for Lina, this opportunity is for her, and there is only one chance. I never forgive betrayal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siler stood down and looked up for a moment before she raised her pitiful expression and restored the embarrassing beauty of her first sight, saying, "I won't let you down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Then I am looking forward to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sosler took it, Richard looked at Lina, shrugged, and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Richard." Lina stopped him, very uneasy, and said for a long time: "I did it wrong, after all, It might be a Piaget collar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "It’s a Piaget."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina understands the meaning of Richard, the Bear Peter family will definitely take a piece of the Earl to return to Sosrel, not because she is so much, but because Richard wants to As the price of a truce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count of the count of Nolande, the value of geometry, look at Goliath and Ellie, you know, it is the power of Gordon, the final battle At the moment, it is just the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Lina didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it's okay, if you give up a Piaget collar, you can feel that there will be a home here, it is worth it for me." Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But,..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped the debate of the Dragon Master and said: Lina, your value is much bigger than you think. At least I am willing to use a count to exchange your trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard waved his hand to Master Long, he left the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Long only felt that the breathing was not smooth enough, and the body was a little weak, so he found a sofa and put himself in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float on the back of the sofa, her eyes are constantly showing the smile of two men, it is a completely different smile, Gordon is always blazing, heavy, such as The rolling lava, and Richard is much gentler and more delicate. The original Richard has always had some tender and green shadows, but recently, his gestures have added more charms like Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard is coming back temporarily, it is not an open return day, so there are not many visitors to the floating island, but I am looking forward to the name of the meeting that Richard has arranged to meet. Still stacking a high glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler has been carefully divided as always, putting the letters of important people together, and Richard gave himself half an hour to put all The letter was opened and browsed again. There was a letter in it that aroused his interest, and repeated readings were repeated twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is Feng Si's close-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the letter, he first expressed his admiration for Richard, and then humbly expressed his remorse for Richard’s disrespect, and then It is to express his enthusiasm for the decoration and the extraordinary talent. At the end of the letter, Vonster expressed his willingness to go under the door of Richard and learn from Richard. He even took the amazing appearance of Richard. On the grounds of achievement, he expressed his willingness to use Richard as the godfather, and baptism can be carried out in the Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a letter that makes Richard extremely speechless. He really can’t imagine that there are such shameless people in the world, but when you think about it, it seems like this. People are not in the minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes it difficult for Richard to understand is that Vonster’s talent is still OK, and he has already entered the door of the decoration, and has resources that ordinary people do not have. In time, it is always possible to make a third-order structure. At that time, he is destined to live a life rich and powerful than most people. Why do you have to play the idea of ​​Richard? No matter which Plane, in this case the conversion of the teacher is not a behavior that will be praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are in this position may be more eager for status and wealth than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the letter and threw it into the paper basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, after seeing five people belonging to the Schumpeter family elders' assembly, he left Noland and went to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the followers of Richard are in Faro, and the situation here is already very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been nearly a year since the end of the Sixth God War. During this year, Richard spent most of his time in the world of construction and magic. In the exhaustion of methods to suppress their own magic, while slowly honing their blood power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t stay in the magic lab all the time, and he personally went to the Iron Triangle Empire for a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more than a month, Richard successively defeated the three integrated corps of the Iron Triangle Empire, completely destroying the two gods of Sinai, the god of time, The Knights of the Temple also killed more than 300 people. Three of the ten most prosperous cities in the southern part of the Iron Triangle Empire were attacked by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war shook the entire Iron Triangle Empire. As the Empire prepared for national mobilization, Richard had withdrawn a large amount of wealth and slowly withdrew from the Empire. In the end, after a long period of quarrel, the Iron Triangle Empire Council finally paid astronomical ransom for the captive 20,000 soldiers and promised not to do so in the future. Then carry out any provocative actions against Richard Crimson. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, in addition to Li Shilongtu in the Iron Triangle Empire, the other famous players have all been defeated in the hands of Richard, and the Empire is not to mention Li Shilongtu The matter is just to let him entangle with the dragons with peace of mind, or to change the taste on the eastern front. Li Shilongtu is already the last god of war in the empire. Once he is defeated in the hands of Richard, the blow to the iron triangle empire will be unprecedented. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no intention or ability to destroy the entire Iron Triangle Empire. After reaching an agreement with the Empire, Richard will transfer the main force to the Zuyuan Heights and continue to the highlands. He marched into the army, and he himself continued to explore in the world of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time from Noland, Richard did not continue this seclusion-like day, he became a little restless, when he was in Oasis City After taking a walk and meeting the beautiful goddess for the seventh time, Richard returned to his small courtyard to summon the star, then rode it and flew directly to the turbulent land where the nest was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't seen the mother's nest for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars fly fast and steady, not long after they reached the turbulent land, Richard let it slow down, looking down, but surprised The land that has seen the turmoil has completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent land at this moment is like a desert, the original forest has long since disappeared, revealing the rockless soil below it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not perceive any life under the soil, even insects. In his memory, the turbulent land is not like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is originally a land with lush vitality, full of all kinds of life, even including some intelligent life such as goblins and cavemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For humans, it’s too dangerous for the turbulent land to be a ghost, but it doesn’t matter to these lives, they are short-lived and powerful. The ability to multiply, even if the entire tribe is swept away by time, can not make up for the loss in two or three years, non-intelligent life is more diverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there is only one piece of boulder left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked forward and saw a new forest on the horizon at the end of his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forest is made up of a tree, a tree grows very tall, the fat leaves sway with the wind, these trees not only grow exactly the same Even the size is high, and the spacing between them is exactly the same. The whole forest looks like the most accurate alchemy machine, which makes people look cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stars passed silently over the forest, all the trees were swaying slightly, as if they were paying tribute to the stars and Richard. It is a very strange forest, and no other life can be felt except those trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the forest, there is a huge nest of insects, and in the distance, there are two same nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clearing in the forest, the nest is lying on the open space, and the surrounding mist is spreading with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
