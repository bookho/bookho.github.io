			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day, the Imperial Frontier Corps that received the alert finally reacted. A light-loaded corps sent a 3,000-person man was chased after Richard. However, Richard’s team is a full cavalry. The speed of the marching and mixed army has reached the limit, but it has not caught up with Richard’s footsteps. After Richard pulled out the last three strongholds, the light armor was still chasing after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eighth day, Richard watched the map on his hand and found that the points marked above were removed. Richard closed the map and sighed to the left and left: "There is nothing to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is a fierce light in both eyes, Shen Sheng Road: "No, the head! We are followed by a group of rookies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the aristocratic youth around him and shrugged and said: The number of the army is ten times that of ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde suddenly waved a heavy axe in his hand and sneered and said: "In my hunger Under the giant axe, they are just three thousand pigs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the epic-level axe brought back by Richard, Gangde’s combat power Directly raised a section. In the past seven days, except for the first night of the caravan, it was a bit of a meaning to kill a Sanctuary strongman in the first battle. The rest of the battle was simply a small fight. Gangde’s giant axe has no room to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message from the elite bats showed that the empire light armor was still in the doldrums, within ten kilometers of Richard’s location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't know how to live!" Richard thought to himself. He looked back at his own 300-person knight, and the wolf-like tiger was not enough to describe these killing machines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s smile took a bit of awkwardness, and decided to give the army a slap in the face of the light-hearted corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is devastating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light-loaded regiment was completely broken, and the rest of the people ran away after the robbery. Behind them, there were thousands of bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of the mind moved, the holy unicorn of his knees stopped, and then slowly turned around in place. Looking at the imperial warriors who fled across the mountains, Richard had no interest in killing. If you do this, most of them will make the light army's number disappear from the ranks of the emperor, but this is meaningless to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the sentence "Go!", he motivated the unicorn and ran towards the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, a group of aristocratic youths kept their eyes on it. They looked at Richard's eyes and were full of fanaticism. They are still a group of passionate young people, and Richard uses soldiers like gods. His armor is so powerful that he is desperate. Those followers usually don’t seem to be superior in strength, but they smother one in the fierce battle. Sanctuary. As for Richard himself, it seems that the magic is similar to the general level of the magician, but once the shot, the power of the magic attack is incredibly large. It can be said that Richard fully conforms to their definition of the hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what are these aristocratic youth doing? From the beginning to the end, they are all watching the battle, there is no need to fight them. At the moment, Richard’s meaning is very clear. He brought these young people, just let them look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this trip, most of them became Richard's fanatical supporters, just like Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, in the blue water oasis city, on the large map of the blood-stained land on the wall of Richard’s war room, a cross-stained blood was drawn. The business route of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the pen and thought for a long time, drew an X in the north near the Iron Triangle Empire, and drew an X on the path leading to the Sequoia Kingdom. Then I said to myself: "It is time to set up a card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood-stained terrain extends in all directions, and it is impossible to completely block it. However, Richard decided to follow the Stables model and put in dozens of cavalry squads around. Once you find a caravan that has not paid the fees to Richard, immediately summon a large force to come. If the caravan is still unwilling to pay the toll, then Richard does not mind collecting all of their goods as a toll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the troops in the encirclement, Richard has already thought about it. He will take part in the participation of the Sequoia kings who participated in the vertical line. The tolls received will also be distributed proportionally among the aristocrats who contribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sweeping the horses and horses of the large and small bloody places, this past bloody land will become a source of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard drew a heavy mark on the blue water oasis city. He is going to use this oasis city as a stronghold in Faro, because the time lighthouse is here, there is no loss. So Richard is ready to build a magic tower here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is the Masters Association of the Sequoia Kingdom. This group of mages who are almost nothing except the magic, after returning, is unexpectedly safe, with no big moves. This result is very unexpected. However, after watching the performances of Kalimi and the silver robe mages, Richard did not think that they would let themselves go. At this time, it is silent, and most of it is planning a plot, and once launched, it must be very fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has picked up a stack of information on the information of all senior mages of the Sequoia Kingdom Masters Association. The sixteen so-called big magisters are all listed, but there are detailed and simple ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most attention to Richard is a mage named Ryan. He has a seventeen-level magic, enough to release the horrible nine-level magic, even in the dark blue is considered a high-end talent. Ryan is only 37 years old this year, which means that he will be able to embark on the watershed of the true power of the 18th level in his lifetime, and even retain the hope of a sprint legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan was only twenty-four when he reached level 12, and he looked at the entire Sequoia kingdom as a unique genius. The problem is that Richard is also at the 12th level in their information, and Richard is only 18 years old this year. Although Richard looked more mature than the actual age, the young face could not fool people. Most people mistakenly think that he is in his early twenties. This is the genius that can be compared with Ryan, and it is also standing on the opposite side of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two sides get along with each other, even with Richard’s self-confidence, they don’t mind killing the opponent in a comfortable situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the Mage Association’s silence mean at the moment? Richard suddenly thought that if he was the upper-ranking of the Masters Association, he suddenly encountered such a young, profound background, and he had a mysterious figure who could threaten the economic lifeline of the association. The first thing is to find a way to figure out him. The origins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of Richard, under the pursuit of a thoughtful person, can not hide for a long time. Although under the cover of the Duke of the Wolf, his origins and genealogy were both hands and feet, but the previous experience could not be completely erased. He chose to dye the blood, except for the wealth here, and the land of the four wars, there is another reason is the chaos here. In the rise of blood-stained land, it is difficult to find the background. But for a behemoth like the Masters Association, this is not an insurmountable difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
