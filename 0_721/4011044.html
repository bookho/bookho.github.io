			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many years of swaying and vain travel, the more you see, the more you discover the vastness of the world, and the dark side of the world must be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long realized that the possibility of finding the lost So Helen in such a vast world is almost zero. But he doesn't care about the result right now. It's a matter of doing things anyway, even if he only looks at what the dark side of the world looks like, he has to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fleet gradually left Noland, marching westward in the vast sea, heading towards the green continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea time, Richard is no longer completely idle, he spends more and more time in the Star Library, now eight books on the third floor The book is being cracked in one book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard's magic level is increased, the speed of cracking the shield is much faster. There is already a book that can be read at the moment. This book is about the common rules of trans-planets, that is to say, if you read all the books in this layer, then in terms of rule power, it is equivalent to the level of entry of super-power. The fourth layer is the pinnacle of the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from the setting of this star library, Richard knows that in the system of ancient stars, it is definitely not the super strong. Because on the fourth floor, there are fifth and sixth layers. As for the light in the center, it is above the sixth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a treasure house, Richard’s current mentality is exceptionally peaceful. He didn't even put all his time into the library, and he took a third out of it to continue reading the memories of countless souls attached to the regular tetrahedron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a story, a world, and has a wonderful life. In the stroll of a world, Richard’s state of mind has also changed bit by bit, becoming more peaceful and calm. Just a change in mood, Richard feels that he can see farther, and he is more thorough about the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how this kind of change in my mind can help me, or even help. The more you look at it, the more attractive the world of these ordinary people is to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not only lords and strong people in the world, but more ordinary people. They lived, worked, and died silently, and propped up the cornerstone of each plane with their own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of ordinary people stories flow through the hearts of Richard. Until one day, when the servant Master told that Richard was not far from the Cangqing mainland, Richard was awakened from the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to the green continent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the attendant Master on the bridge roof. At this moment, there is still a vast sea, but in the distant horizon, you can see a bird squatting in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk, Mina, and other members of the emissary group of the Millennium Empire, and the splashes are on the bridge. Several mages are adjusting the magic map, and on the map, you can see a spot that is quickly approaching the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the arrival of Richard, a mage said: "His Royal Highness, we are now about a thousand kilometers away from the green continent, according to the current speed and weather conditions, It will arrive in about half a day. But we are almost ignorant of the green continent, and we don’t know where to find a port that can park the fleet. The plan now is to follow the southern coastline of the mainland after approaching the green continent. OK, there is a greater likelihood of a natural harbor in this direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goshawk came over and said: "According to the strength of the Elf Empire Magic Fleet We should have entered their daily patrol area. From now on, it is very likely that we will encounter the patrol fleet of the Elven Empire, and we should be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded, turned and said: "Improve the first-level alert level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several masters immediately rushed down the bridge and went to various places to order. On the other six warships, the unit of the mother's nest also received the order of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the entire fleet began to show a faint moonlight, and the speed increased slightly. The entire fleet broke through the waves like a sword and accelerated forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly reached out and a portal was in front of him. He walked in and the next moment appeared on the height of the kilometer. The whole process of transmission seems so natural, there is no mantra, and there is no magic fluctuation, just like the portal is naturally there. Even the goshawk, which is close at hand, did not notice the magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the goshawk has always been calm, I don’t feel that I have changed my face at this moment. Even in the face of Faro's final battle against the Reaper, the Goshawk can see the limits of his strength. However, it has not been how long it has been in the past. Even the Goshawk is very clear that Richard did not deliberately improve his strength. However, at this moment, he could not see through Richard’s strength and could not see through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment I saw it, Goshawk didn’t even feel that Richard was a mage. If there is no relevant memory, Goshawk will even think that Richard is just an ordinary person who is less than three. Just as he was more and more surprised, a portal suddenly appeared around him, and Richard walked out of it quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen the patrol fleet of the Elven Empire, just in our West. They have not found us yet, so let's go."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha made an order in consciousness, and a 18th-level night elf elite mage in the battleship control hall immediately displayed a series of coordinates on the magic map. Then dozens of mages and hundreds of sailors in the whole ship controlled the behemoth to turn slowly, leaning to the West, and then the entire fleet began to accelerate slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, there were several flying giant eagle in the western sky. They have a luxurious and complex neck ornament on their necks. At first glance, they are not ordinary giant eagle. It is the changing form of the elf's giant eagle Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant eagle saw the size of the fleet that was rushing, and suddenly he was shocked and obviously confused. Then a giant eagle quickly went, and the rest flew to the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant eagle stopped in the air hundreds of meters from the fleet, and snarled in Noland’s idiom: "Where are you coming from the fleet? Here is the sea of ​​the elf empire Stop the boat immediately, wait for the inspection! Otherwise, all sink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the giant eagle with the arrogance of the high elves, this is the first time Richard In contact with the high elves, I finally realized the style of the Elven Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the Goshawk and sighed: "Although I also have the blood of the Silver Moon Elf, I have to admit that these high elves still It’s really annoying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goshawk shrugged and said, “Don’t expect me to comment on this. I’m not that stupid!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay! I really don't know if you are really sleek, or pretend." Richard immediately looked up and looked at the four giant eagle Druids in the sky, said indifferently: "All sinking? Hehe, first I don't say this, but I really don't like someone flying over my head. It's forbidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last word, Richard is speaking in the language from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Goshawk finally realized the magical fluctuations, but what made him dissatisfied was that he still couldn’t figure out what this magical fluctuation represents. . It's not like gravity, it's not like vacuum, it's not like paralysis. All in all, it has nothing to do with any magic that is prohibited by the Goshawk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the four giant eagle in the air suddenly made a panic cry, desperately flapping their wings. But no matter how hard they try, they can't stop falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three giant eagle fell directly into the sea, and a giant eagle slammed on the bow deck like a stone, making a squeaking noise . Falling from a height of hundreds of meters, even these 16-level Druid can not afford, this unlucky giant eagle directly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three giant eagle are carrying a heavy load in the sea, struggling. But no matter how hard they work, as soon as they leave the water, they will fall back into the sea like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and said, "Give those three up. If you are disobedient, you will get stunned."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so Archimonde warriors and night elf warriors jumped into the water and quickly rushed to the three giant eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant eagle really refused to be honest and injured two soldiers. As a result, the fierce Archimonde immediately grabbed them a fat, stunned, and then wrapped their mouths with ropes for several laps, which brought the three giant hawks on the deck and sent them to the deck. In front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee reached out and Kimsley immediately got together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake them up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginsley giggled and said, "This is Simple." She stretched out her dead hands and stroked over the four giant eagle. In the next moment, her actions were completely incompatible with the master of the soul. She went up to give each giant eagle a foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the use of gold wire is not large, but the four giant eagle immediately wake up from the coma, screaming and screaming, and then constantly rolling on the ground. The night elves immediately held them down, but these movements made them feel severe pain, and the wailing sounds were louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godhawk slightly frowns, this painful deepening is nothing remarkable, just to enlarge the feeling of the creature to pain. But let the four eagle Druids, who are not low in level, feel like this. Two of them are gradually showing human figures. How many times does this pain increase? The ability to use such a common spell to this extent, Kingsley does not know how many creatures to torture, will have such insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plain plain sentence, for Kingsley No less than a supreme purpose. She immediately lifted the painful deepening of the four Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at two Druids who remained in the shape of the giant eagle and said, "The form is lifted."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant eagle immediately changed back to the elf form unstoppable. Four naked elves curled up into groups and were ashamed and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Druids are three men and one woman, both of which are sixteen. The squad of the squadron's outpost Druid also has such a level, from the side highlights the strength of the elf empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the war with the Reaper, Richard will no longer put such strength in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the four wolf-stricken Druids and said faintly: "I will remember to be polite when I talk to me next time. This is the strongest." At least respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also considered a strong?!" Female Druid screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another Druid immediately stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four elves couldn’t see the strength of Richard. After Richard said a strange ban, they suddenly could not fly. Until now they have not figured out whether they are magic or curse or something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no magic or vindictive fluctuation from Richard, it is obvious that this young man is not simple. Otherwise, he will not be the leader of such a powerful fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
