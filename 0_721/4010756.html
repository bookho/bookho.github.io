As for the debt, it is not an option at all. The dragon of the fire, Bahamut, is also known to exist with Tiamat. Far from being able to compete with Carroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This violent Carroll is now almost unwilling to wait for a moment, always looking in the direction of the portal, the current portal has It is barely available for it to pass, but it is really hard to squeeze it, and the probability of serious injury in the channel is still more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are lucky enough to enter Faro intact, the unstable plane span does not know how much movement will be made there, Carolol does not want to return The failure to find the damn human first attracted the intervention of the Faro gods, so no matter how anxious he was, he did not dare to try to pass through the plane portal at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the plane transfer door, just a contour, let Carcarol round his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Nogent, the Dragon Slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure has caused many dragons to tremble, and Carroll has had a life in the youth. Therefore, when this figure appeared, especially when his momentum began to rise sharply, Carcarol immediately fell cold, without thinking, rushing out before all the guards who guarded the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coverage of the dragon's interest is very wide, and Carroll is fully attacked. The dragon slayer's 'Nuo-Jian' suddenly flies, even with the funeral There are hundreds of dragons who guard the portal, and more than half of the transfer magic arrays have been destroyed and the entire two secondary arrays have been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol stunned, the mystery of countless dragons, promise, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hasn’t figured out what is going on, another familiar figure appears in the portal, and Carroll’s heart is floating up to a loud degree. In the name of Nuoyun, the star sage Rosspan, the dreamy meteor rain gauze enveloped him in his body, and its instinct was a bit of a dragon spurt out, so Rosanne disappeared again, disappearing another level two Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for someone to appear in the portal, this time Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever Carroll did not take the lead in this move, but let the dragons who have just gathered them keep their formations, first observe and understand And this human being, although he feels familiar, can't name it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Connaught and Star Sage Rosanne, Richard is also a booster, and then there is a sign of preparation for magic, but this time, not an illusion, more than ten The fireball suddenly burst out of the hands of Richard, and the fire with the blue flame instantly engulfed the guarded dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Richard turned and walked into the portal, Carolall realized that the human being was a real strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's plane, or Carol's trouble, is just beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Carroll met many legendary figures, including the bloody king Odin, the elemental lord Tumen, the university Solomon And even Su Hailun, the dragon enslaver who has recently begun to spread his reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol feels that his heart has become extremely powerful over the past few days, and the strength has greatly exceeded the sum of the past eight hundred years. Whatever comes out of the portal, there will be no spurt of spurt, because if you spray a bit more, it will not be enough to rebuild the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol has already put all his credits on, and now it can’t borrow even a piece of time, although it can resist holding the attack. Many characters coming out of the portal, but every time I saw that person with a distinctive figure, Carolol still has the feeling of heartbeat acceleration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caucarol now has a feeling that as a dragon, life is too old and knowledge is too rich, it seems that it is not a good thing, if it does not know With so many legends, there will be no troubles today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many legendary strongmen every day in the plane portal, of which Odin has appeared six times, and the dragon slayer has appeared nine times, Richard And many of his followers appeared, Richard himself appeared eight times, Zonghu, Twilight, Splash, and Tiramisu each came five or six times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them are fake, but every time a real person comes, the dragons around the portal will be killed and wounded. Although the dragons are numerous and low-status, they are similar to livestock, but they are wasted too much in a short time. Even the dragon can't stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol couldn’t stand the huge casualties, removed the dragons who surrounded the portal, and prepared to let the people inside the portal come in. After seeing it again, this trick has played several roles. However, Richard immediately adjusted the strategy. They did not leave the step of the portal, always stood at any time to enter the portal, and then began to destroy the transmission magic. Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s first fireball slammed into the unfinished magical array, it seemed to be on the heart of Carroll’s heart, let the dragon’s The heart is bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol screamed desperately and rushed to the past. If Richard fired another fireball, it would use his own dragon body to block it. However, Richard only fired a fireball, and then entered the portal again, leaving no opportunity for Kakarer to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball of Richard is not an ordinary fireball. Carol has long been a deep understanding, even if it has a defensive magic for the Portal Magic. Raised to the eighth level, or fragile like a paper under the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a while to dare to turn to see the place where the fireball bombarded, to see how the magical array was damaged, this look The dragon only feels that it is black in front of him, the area destroyed is beyond imagination, and the hard foundation has been melted more than one meter. The power is where the fireball is, and the adult dragon is full of strength. But so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol is not easy to calm down, and then take a closer look at the loss, I think it seems possible to make up, the mood is calm, it seems fixed The nine-level defensive magic array played a number of roles. The time stone of the Portal Magic Array can be used to repair it, but the defensive magic array has completely evaporated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this change, Carroll found that he could no longer afford more losses, so he gritted and sent the dragons to defend. The plane-level portal, the nine-level defensive magic array is converted into a dragon, which is a big team number, and now the magic material is extremely scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the casualties of the dragons went up straight, the numbers were thrilling every day, the dragons were also wealth, and the dragons in Carcarol’s own name were very It can't be consumed quickly, and the loss is exhausted. It has to borrow Dragon Dragons from other dragons, and with the decline of credit, it has to make more and more demanding conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolol understands that he has become a laughing stock in the world of dragons, but now the situation is as good as an arrow. He has long since retreated, and he can only die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carroll also sent a large number of dragons to travel through the plane to Faro, and wanted to deal with Richard in the same way, but all believers have Going back, there is no information to pass back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few times, Carolol suddenly realized that his move of emulation was stupid, and Richard was not the same as him. There is nothing to worry about, how much to kill, even if the destruction of the plane portal does not matter, maybe in the middle of the mind, but here is afraid of hurting the expansion of the transmission magic array, will bind the feet. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are a large number of dragons, but there are not many leading figures, and the Sanctuary and the Great Magic Guide are coming to an end, like there are many followers of Richard. And all of them are wicked and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Richard, Tiramisu, Twilight, Shuihua, and Zonghu all have the power to kill the legendary dragons, and later In the portal, a mountain and a sea were drilled. Although Princess Carando’s vindictiveness was not worth mentioning, but her body was too strong, she saw a dragon that Carocar’s majesty slammed and rushed to turn eleven tons. Hey, how could the dragon care about such a toothpick-like thin iron rod, so he did not care to cross the claws, and then only heard a crisp sound, and the dragon claws were cut off on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon is extremely clever, suddenly suffered a heavy blow, actually turned around and ran, let the mountains and the sea catch up, the barbarian girl still listens to Richard’s words. After seeing a shot, I saw no chance, no pursuit, and I immediately returned to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time goes by, the dragons who keep the gates in the plane see more and more legends, just like reading a legendary biography. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few days, Richard sent the template of the Nolan Strong, which was different in the next few days. Richard sent a special return to Nolan. De collects resources. In the Royal Masters Association, there are a lot of relevant records of the strong planes. These are not secrets. They say hello to the president and all the information is obtained by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials have been seen by Richard, which is equivalent to the hen’s nest. Only one day’s effort, the star plaque carries hundreds of legendary figures of different sizes. When he came to the Dragon Valley, it was said that he was actually seen in these legendary powerhouses. He was the savage behemoth of the sorcerer who was slain by Philip in the rising sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
