			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee let the fleet slow down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After flying from the Elf Empire fleet, several giant eagle Druids hovered over the fleet of Richard, and the sound amplified by magical power allowed the ship to be on the battleship. Everyone can hear it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, and the ambassadors of the Millennium Empire, you have now entered the territory of the Elf Empire, and must obey the orders of Wang Ting! Now, the Great Elf King has There is a metaphor. First of all, you must immediately hand over the twigs of the Golden World tree and explain its source! Secondly, during your stay in the Elven Empire, the control of these warships must be handed over to us. After we check and After confirming that it is harmless, it will be returned to you when you leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf Druid even made the members of the empire of the Millennium Empire look dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina snorted and said, "Is the warship handed over to them? I am afraid I will not come back after I have handed it out!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "There is no room for negotiation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant eagle shouted: "This is the Great Elf King." The order! There is no room for negotiation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Good. Since you are not willing to talk peacefully, then I will sink." You, change the wave of people who are willing to talk. Also, I really don't like people flying on my head and banned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several giants The eagle Druid suddenly screamed, flapping his wings in vain, but it did not work at all, like a stone fell into the sea one by one. One of them also bounced on the deck before it rolled down the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk finally saw a little bit this time: "You changed the rules around them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard looked at the Goshawk with a glance and said, "It has only changed a little bit, and it is temporary. It is just to make them flap the wings."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant Elf fleet immediately rang a long battle, the main fleet rushed to the front of the Richard Fleet, grabbed a favorable position, and the patrol sub-fleet was like a wolf to the Richard Fleet At the back, waiting for an opportunity to give them a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Fleet is indeed well-trained, and its main battleships are formed separately during the march, and the speed has immediately increased by a large margin, reaching 60 kilometers. On the side of the battleship, a giant cannon that shines with magical light is ready for battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of cannon with a range of up to 10,000 meters was the weapon that the Elf Empire was able to cross the ocean. When the high elves lost to the vast green continent, the Wang Ting fleet defeated the joint fleet of all ethnic groups at sea. After more than a thousand years, all ethnic groups no longer plan to enter the Qingqing continent. Even now, this kind of cannon is still much more advanced than the dragon blood dwarf or the gray dwarf's cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the High Elf, such a fleet lineup is enough to deal with a fleet of three or five Richards. Noland's magic warships have always liked to make huge, but big but not strong, and the battleships of high elves at sea are the living targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the Elf Fleet, there are also strong players taking off. They are the airspace that defends the existing fleet, and it is also convenient to transmit information commands to each other, so that the entire fleet can coordinate actions. Only the Elf Fleet's other killer, the Giant Eagle Druid, formed a team. After seeing Richard's incomprehensible means of ban, he did not dare to send it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet of Richard is slowly accelerating, and the shells of several giant metal turrets on the deck slowly open, revealing square metal rails that are tens of meters long inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several powerful gunners put a special three-meter-long arrow on the end of the rail, the card is finished, and then the mages corrected the final launch. data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rails slowly rotate, aiming at a main ship led by the Elf Fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly 30 kilometers, the battleship under the seat of Richard suddenly trembled and traversed a short distance! As many as six smashing arrows are fired and thrown into the distant Elf battleship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk, Mina, and the messengers of all the Millennium Empires are all shocked, what is this range! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow is lightning fast, the elf warship is still desperately accelerating, wanting to seize the battle. When I found out that the six arrows were directed at myself, I was completely out of reach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent explosion continued, and a group of sultry fires continued to rise in the Elf battleship. Every time the explosion occurred, the two-hundred-meter-long main battleship would violently beat. When the six-headed arrow was in the middle, it simply burst into three pieces and quickly sank into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, apart from a whirlpool, some floating wood and flags, the trace of the main battleship could no longer be found. Most of the high elves on the ship had no time to escape, and they could only sink into the sea with the warships, and even if the elves would be watery, they would not be able to prevent at least half of them from being caught in the wreck of a shipwreck like a winch. Whether they can escape depends on luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Moon Warship was launched, the soldiers immediately filled in the new arrow, and the battleship began to speed up, the speed quickly exceeded 100 kilometers, just like Flying in the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the blue moon, the rest of the Azure Color, Amber Moon warships are also firing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ** arrow flies to the Elf fleet with death! Their bombardment is not as accurate as the blue moon, only about one-third of the hit rate. However, the power of the arrow is too great. In the middle and the upper arrow, a huge hole of several meters in diameter will be blown up on the elf warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of seven warships all bombarded, the Elf’s twelve main battleships have been sunk four, seriously injured three, and more than half of the damage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet of Richard followed the speed of the Blue Moon to speed up the speed of the high elves at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour. A large arc was intercepted in the side of the main battleship of the elf, then slowed down, aimed, and bombarded. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the second round of bombardment, only four of the main ships of the elves were still floating, leaving only one intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, Archimonde’s fleet began to speed up and began to squash the higher-level elves’ first-class cruise ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortcomings of the weak defense of the cruise ship are undoubted at this moment. As long as the middle and upper rifle can be directly smashed into two. Even if the drop point of the cannon is high, it can blow up the entire bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard simply led the fleet to approach within 10,000 meters, and the accuracy of the rifle at this distance was greatly improved, hitting two-thirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven magical warships named after the moon are like the devils walking in the world, constantly letting one opponent into the sea. The sea is full of wreckage and floating high elves. In the midst of desperation, the superiors of the higher elves began to sneak into the flagship of Richard. But in the forbidden field of Richard, the strongmen below the legend can only come close by swimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They worked hard to catch up with the blue moon, but they were shot and killed by the night elf shooters on the battleship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two legendary strongmen just rushed to the top of the blue moon, and before he released a large-scale magic, he was struck by a splash of water. Kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another legendary strongman saw the situation is not good, immediately turned around and fled to the direction of the green continent, Richard is not ready to chase, he still needs Someone went to ventilate the Elf Wang Ting so that the high elves who lived in the tree knew what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the naval battle is nearing its end, and the remaining dozens of small warships have fled. Instead of pursuing, Richard ordered the start of the rescue of the high elves who floated on the sea. Only if they resist, they will be killed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all night elves responsible for the rescue. The high elves seem to have seen the ghosts, and they are stunned by these night elves who are very similar to their appearance. However, in the records of the green continent, the last silver moon elf of Noland has been destroyed, and the remaining silver moon elves have already fled to the green continent. Where are these elves coming from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful power of the night elves clearly shows their noble lineage and identity. Such a force, that is, several kings are also difficult to shoulder. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen seriously wounded elf warships on the sea. Richard has no interest in the antique warships of these elves, and directly ordered the sinking. The fleet then sailed towards the nearest port city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the quiet forest in the eastern part of the Cangqing continent, stands a huge world tree with a height of nearly a thousand meters. Although this world tree is limited by its own race, it will always stop here, but it is also very close to the Golden World tree in terms of coverage and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Elf King Theo Liege, who lives in the world tree, leads all the elves within a million square kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blue sky in the afternoon, a slender bird cuts through the sky like electricity, flies into the quiet forest, goes straight to the world tree, and finally wears The magnificent palace on the top of the canopy is parked on the window sill of the tallest tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Elf is sitting at the window and flipping through a beautifully printed collection of poems. This is the latest collection of poems by Wang Ting's most famous poet, Faral Yonge. It has not yet been published. Only a few great elf kings can get his personal gift to collect opinions, or praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
