			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Assembly all know King Hussein, and he is quite polite to him. He replied at the moment: "This person sneaked into the palace and wanted to assassinate His Royal Highness The result was killed by His Highness on the spot. Now, according to the instructions of His Highness, we hanged his body on the gate of the palace to show the crowd. Hey, a legend in the district, and want to assassinate the true God of the temple under the hand of the Highness, not to mention the little one. The legendary "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king once again stunned, he realized at this time that the construction of the knights called His Highness, not his title and patriarch identity, but His strength of respect and surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dragon's body was lifted away, the king still had a very unreal feeling, if in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary strongman who used to be supreme in the old Shulan period, the whole god of Shulan, turned into a corpse, and was dragged by several people like a garbage Got away <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the knights walked away, a cold breeze blew, and the king immediately chilled, and this came back. He rushed to Richard's residence, but was told that Richard had entered the magic laboratory, and that he would not be disturbed if there were no special matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King waited until dawn, and did not see Richard coming out of the lab, but had to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Richard came out of the magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen Ma is lying in a rocking chair, waiting for him to come out. She walked around the king city with the costume knight and returned. Leaving Wangcheng, just making it, let Longxing know that she has gone. Otherwise, Long Xing may not dare to show up. At that time, although Richard was also sure to catch him, he had to spend a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Senma, Richard nodded to her and said, "Go clean up and go to Lina’s grave to see."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma nodded and went with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Richard and Senma stood in front of Lina’s tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Master Long is sleeping is as beautiful as before. Richard kneels in front of the tombstone, picks up a thin layer of dust with his hand, then takes out a magic box, opens it, takes out a star badge from the inside, and gently put it in front of the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a twisted face in the center of the badge that looks full of pain. That is the face of the dragon star, and actually can slowly change the expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this badge, Senma’s eyebrows are raised and he is surprised. Because the badge is just its appearance, in fact it is a construction, a very powerful structure. All the structures that have sealed the souls of the legendary strong are the structures of the holy order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lina, Dragon Star is dead. Now I have made his soul into a magical soul, sealed in this crying hell, let him live forever. ?ahref="http://www.wkfdu.com/"target="_blank">http://www.wkfdu.com/ 嗤 愫 愫 愫 愫 愫 惺 惺 惺 惺 惺      纯茨愕摹!? /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard turned and left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senma glanced at Lina's tombstone and the badge-like sacred costume, waved her hand, said goodbye to Lina, and followed Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard did not immediately leave Shulan, but said to Senma: "You will go back to Wangcheng and wait for me. I will go to the nest to see it. By the way, I will stay alone for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma nodded, waved to Richard, and left with his long sword, and the unrestrained back appeared to be a bit lonely.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is also a person, climbing along the winding mountain road of the mountain. He walks step by step, at a constant pace, that is, not in a hurry, not slack, such as a The most sophisticated alchemy machine climbed the top of the mountain and walked to the nest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a change of space, Richard stood before the old battle scene. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything hasn’t changed, as if it was standing here last time, just a minute ago. The wreckage of a huge ship is slowly floating in the void, and numerous broken parts Then floating around the hull, silently supporting the attacks that have happened to the destruction of the land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hei tried to reach out, but just Crossing the invisible boundary, there was a lingering black air in the void. He immediately took back his hand and did not let the black gas entangle When Richard's hand, and those black gas will disappear <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Now that Richard and the eyes of the year are naturally different, it is obvious that the space on the ancient battlefield is extremely fragile. Even Richard's hand is stuck in, so that a simple movement and space structure can not bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas is the spatial crack that naturally arises. If Richard does not close his hand, it will be swallowed up by the damaged space. There is also a strange maintenance force in the air that can repair the damaged space structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, this extremely fragile, yet self-healing space becomes a dangerous trap area. Even if the legendary strongman does not take care of it, he must be buried here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard has the power of the space lord, he is not sure that he can safely pass through this airspace, perhaps when he thoroughly analyzes the rules of the nest, Really enter this ancient battlefield. Just as far as the sight is seen, Richard knows that even if it is a rusty metal plate, the knowledge contained therein is worth the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time to the nest, Richard is not looking for secrets. As he and Senma said, I just want to sit alone in the ancient battlefield, which is so bleak and frightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, it was a complete destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the terrible power of both sides of the war, how many brilliant civilizations have been created, have now been destroyed in the war. All life, soul and glorious deeds are turned into pieces of cold metal wreckage, which wanders forever in this battleship cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experienced so many plane wars and defeated countless opponents, the once powerful enemies can only be in the army of Archimonde. Before shaking, even if it is reborn, it will not be better than Richard now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving thirteen knights, now the power is also surpassed by the followers of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, Richard’s mind is questionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War, so many wars, what is it for?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a strong opponent Like himself, Richard knows that one day, he will fall down and become another stepping stone to the top of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the wars are at the end, will it be like the battleship cemetery in front of us, the eternal silence?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal giant ships built with incredible power, Perhaps every ship has the ability to destroy the plane, but even if the power is strong enough, how can it be <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night once said that the plane war is one In the helpless gambling game, everyone in the game has to put all of their own, otherwise it will become the victim of other players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also sees from a sub-level plane that if Noland is not expanding abroad, it will be the same as these sub-planets. A vassal for a powerful plane, even a slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eternal destiny<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been sitting for a long time and have been thinking for a long time. This problem has been bothering him for a long time, and now it appears again. However, twice before and after, the height of his station has been completely different, and the angle of thinking is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not intend to keep thinking about it because he knew that there was no answer to this question. Perhaps the dragon of eternal and time can't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of Richard’s vision, a broken battleship slowly emerged and flew away from the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case in the ancient battlefield. There are always things that appear, and things will disappear from time to time. This warship is not big. Compared with the wreckage of the giant ships, they are some auxiliary ships. But when I saw it, Richard stood up and screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen this battleship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt extremely frightened, and this emotion has not appeared on him for a long time. He was so scared, even lost a minimum of calm, searching desperately in memory, trying to find out where he had memories of this strange warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly reached out and took out the last imprint, looking at the crazy shape of the metal inside, the blood on his face instantly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last mark represents the reaper, and Richard knows that they are very powerful, but how powerful it is but it is unclear. There is not much record about the reaper, and all the planes that have truly faced the reaper are completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard knows that he will face the reaper in Faro sooner or later, but there are still some fantasies in his heart, and he thinks that the reaper may not be as strong as the legend. Moreover, Richard also prepared in advance, he tied a large number of legendary powers to his chariot in the great interest of the dragon plane, so he was prepared to have the opportunity to defeat the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, a reaper's battleship is in sight! Looking at the battleship that was hundreds of meters long, Richard only felt that it was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal in the last mark has changed like such a warship. There may be nothing in a warship alone, but it can change more than one warship. Other strange and terrifying war mechanics will appear one after another<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Behind these metal giant ships, representing what kind of war power, Richard did not understand, but knew that they were almost invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually calmed down, put away the last mark, and took another look at the battlefield, then turned and left the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper is really powerful and incredibly powerful. But war always has to be carried out. Since this is inevitable, then it is necessary to ask for a surname. Why do you think so much?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the city of Shulan, Senma was keenly aware that Richard’s face was not very good. She thought that Richard was still thinking about Lina. She also missed the Dragon Master, so she didn't know how to comfort Richard. She just waited quietly around Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not stop much, leaving the Hummer with the horses and the team to fill the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Noland, Richard contacted Nolan for the first time. The great priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple is now ready to take control of the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Alliance, and she is also one of Richard's most important partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
