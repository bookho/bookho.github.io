Constantly ups and downs, when another bounce, the girl has already ejected like a white lightning! The branches suddenly swelled down, and the eye was about to reach the limit of the bend, but the girl’s pedaling power had disappeared, and it echoed upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a leap, Richard couldn’t help but admire in his heart. He has studied dark techniques and understands the mystery of the power behind this bounce. It is a small matter to step on a branch, but it leaves traces that cannot be erased. A brilliant hunter can use this trace to track the whereabouts of the prey. The seriously injured prey is in front, but the girl did not slack off in the final blow, leaving no trace of her own progress. If not trained, the control of the details has reached the point of instinctive reaction, that is, born Killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl fell silently on the ground, then plundered at an incredible speed, quickly getting closer to the prey. The bare feet are often only on a certain rock, and people will rush out a few meters like an arrow. Looking from afar, she is like a flying white ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seriously injured prey finally climbed to the other side of the stream, and then the foot was unstable, and one was planted on the ground. After a serious injury, he was soaked in the cold stream. He apparently approached the edge of the collapse, struggling to climb up, plant it again, climb again, and then fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is in the costume, is brewing the final blow, it seems to want to die." Lina continued to comment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has just stepped into the threshold of the Great Magister, her perception and combat experience is not the same as that of Richard. Lina also found that Richard was very interested in this new hunter, so he provided more information for judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the girl is getting faster and faster, the body is gradually leaning forward, and the hands can almost touch the ground. In a flash, she rushed to the bank of the stream, and then slammed like a beast, leaping out, a faint figure pulling a white trail in the air, during which the hands were light on a rock just out of the water in the stream. With a light ride, the whole person bowed his back and his feet fell on the rock, and then she shot like an arrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard seems to have seen a fierce and sly winter wolf, and is trying to hunt down the prey. More than ten meters wide mountain creek, she just crossed a leap and chased after the prey. In the whole process of hunting, she barely made even a little bit of sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seriously injured man accurately captured her position, just in this moment completely abandoned the disguise, turned like a lightning bolt, screaming to pounce on her. From the comparison of body type, you can know that his strength is far better than that of a wild animal, and the close fight is definitely dominant. However, the girl did not mean to retreat to dodge, but directly rushed up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl obviously jumps faster and higher than the man. When they see each other in the air, the girl suddenly becomes a group, and the feet are lightning-like in the man. When the body stepped on, the whole person borrowed the power to flip and turn, and had already passed behind the man. Then, if I was held by an invisible hand, I suddenly changed my direction in the air, and I brushed it on the man's back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time seems to have been fixed at this time, the girl’s right hand is on the throat of the prey, and the left hand is not sure when it is more than a black and heavy. A steel cone-like weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, just under the watchful eyes of Richard, the girl’s left hand slammed forward, and the steel cone had fallen into the man’s buttocks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this blow, Richard suddenly chilled and subconsciously caught his butt. Fortunately, he looked around and saw that many people had subconscious movements, and even Lina moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly screamed at the screaming trombone, his body suddenly collapsed and slammed from the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the girl’s wrist turned over and pushed forward again until the steel cone had no handle, and the steel vertebra was taken out, bringing out a flying blood. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tumbling for two consecutive times, has been far from the prey, no longer pays attention to the man who is dying, but crouching on the ground like a wolf, looking around at the wooden house And the outcrop of the students in the mountain wall, the meaning of the threat is very obvious. Kraft, who has a black elf lineage, has already taken a few steps forward, but seeing that the girl has not been hit hard, and there is no sign of physical exhaustion, so she spread her hand and took the extended foot back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other students, when the girl’s fierce gaze swept over, most of them turned their eyes to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no one wants to compete for prey, and the man also lost the last struggle, just fell to the ground and twitched, the girl went to the prey The ridge of the steel vertebra in his hand opened his throat and ended his long pain. Then he touched him on his chest, pulled out a silver nameplate, and pulled a chain, took it in his hand and walked towards Schiller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was a few meters away from Schiller, she stopped, no longer approached, and her body collapsed, apparently in an extremely alert state. This tension is even stronger than when she faced her partner in the training camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, she threw the nameplate she had removed from the prey to Schiller and said in a stiff tone: "This month's ... brand!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller nodded and said, "You are the third brand this month, very good, I will ask you to take your share tomorrow. Something was sent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina whispered a few words at Richard's ear. The death camp will be put into the 'prey' from time to time, and each prey has a nameplate. Participants need to kill prey every month and get a certain number of brands before they can get the corresponding supplies, such as equipment, materials and medicines to improve individual ability and quality. Among them, the pharmacy is a big one, mainly to strengthen the individual combat effectiveness of the students. Each student also has a sign indicating his identity. As long as the person who is used as a prey can hand over a student's brand, he can be free, which is much safer than direct escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the students who are not qualified, the first three will be punished, the punishment content will be from abuse to **, only to the extent, regardless of gender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth time a student who is not quantified will become a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing the sign to Schiller, the girl glanced at Lina again, then slowly retreated, still nervous, not willing to back They are. At this moment, a magical radiance suddenly flashed on her, the girl was shocked, and then the messy hair was almost rooted! Brushing, she has been crouching on the ground, the bloodless steel chisel slipped into the left hand palm. Her double-eyed eyes are already staring at Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina stepped forward, half blocked in front of Richard, and the gorgeous staff was in her hand. In the face of the murderous murder of the girl, Lina also looked a little dignified. Master Long was very surprised. He didn't understand why this girl would bring her a little dangerous feeling. The power of the girl is not very outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the magical brilliance of the girl's body, the same as Lina's previous release, it is also a detection technique. However, the general mage can only obtain the regular data feedback of power, elements, magic, blood, etc., and only the masters who have practiced the special perception can detect the bearing capacity of the opponent from the magic fluctuation reflected by the detection. The level of high and low, and such as Richard can be accurate to single digits, but it is difficult for large architects to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of Lina and Schiller, I didn’t feel hurt, and the girl’s murder finally faded, and slowly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Richard suddenly stopped the girl, then pointed her to him and said to Schiller: "I want her!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller’s eyebrows immediately scraped together and said, “She’s called Splash, it should be between 16 and 18 years old, and she is currently a 9th-level killer. She For the danger of a keen sense of smell, combat talent is also very good, but now is not the most suitable for you. One reason is that she just arrived at level 9, the level is lower than the three I recommend to you, you are going to the lower level The plane is best to send a person who reaches the 10th limit. Another reason is that she has not had any blood circulation ability so far. And she is difficult to tame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the girl and said, "I have a soul contract. Taming is not a problem. Why does she call this strange name, what kind of rare race? And why can't she know her age? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller hesitated and said, "She was accidentally in the depths of the forest." When she arrived, she lived with a group of moon wolves. She should have been raised by a wolf group since she was a child. At that time, she was about five years old, which was judged by human standards, but then I taught her to talk, she I still can't say that I have lived with the wolves for a few years, so I can't determine her age. As for the name, it was taken by the trainees. It is said that she is as delicious as the fig, delicious and powerful. It is also very poisonous, and ordinary people can't touch it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! It's her." Richard apparently made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina couldn’t help but interject: "Lee, do you want to think about it again? Although she has a lot of fighting talent, but after all, she has not shown bleeding. Ability, this is an irreparable injury. And Schiller also said that she was raised by the wolves, so we have no way to verify her origin, and it is impossible to infer whether she has hidden blood power. I feel that I should be cautious. In contrast, Gangde is the most suitable choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lina’s concerns are justified. In terms of theoretical combat power, the blood and the magical structure are both very important and even decisive components. For example, the same two 18-level big magisters, with the ability to have high-order and powerful blood, may completely suppress the other. Gordon sent her to follow Richard, not to arbitrarily point people, but to use Li Na's rich magic knowledge to help Richard pick the soul guard, not let him offset too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the persuasion, Lina stared at the beautiful face and the beautiful and powerful body curve. Suddenly, it was possible that Richard might have looked at it. Her position made this decision. After all, the strength of the water flower is also very outstanding. From the previous scene, she also has a horrible fighting instinct. In actual combat, this talent is not worse than the talent for directly improving power. Just to use a soul contract on her, it seems too wasteful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lina was born into a real aristocratic family, and the requirements for elegance and taste are very high, so I feel very uncomfortable with the means of splashing my opponent’s anus. . However, from the experience of the water flower, she is raised by the moon wolf in the demon wolf class and can be compared with the winter wolf. It is not surprising that the color of the wolf is strong in battle. The training of the death camp is only about killing the opponent, and will not care which part she attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
