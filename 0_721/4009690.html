			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; () <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Stevenson hesitated and then pondering laughed and said: "I didn't expect you to be smart! I am not a member of the Law Enforcement Division, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing! You don't want to touch me again! If you want to come hard, I will yell." The voice of the girl is getting bigger and bigger. This is a very remote area, and each area has a good control of the direction of the sound wave and the amount of accumulation to avoid excessive noise echo. Therefore, the voice of the girl can’t be transmitted far, and it’s useless to call it again. The key is that every public area in the dark blue has magic record equipment, and the girl's scream is just for the record of the magic record. Dark blue is the field of legendary mage. If Stevenson uses violence to get the girl's body, then Su Hailun will know how long it will take. According to the legendary Master's temper, Stevenson's best results will be beaten like Randolph, and then stripped of apprenticeship to drive out of the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in Deep Blue has a corresponding price, and the girl is very aware of her value. She believes that no one normal person will give up the identity of the legendary apprentice in order to get his body. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Stevenson really stopped, no further meaning of hands. The girl did not dare to over-excite him. This man has some kind of temperament that makes her shudder. So Irene didn't stay any longer, but turned to the direction of the transmission array. Even if she wants to spend a lot more money, she is not willing to be close to Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can reconsider." There was a voice from Stevenson behind Irene, and another voice that made her hesitate. That was The crisp sound of a gold coin collision. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "there are at least two hundred gold coins!" dense crash let the girl instinctively determine the approximate number of gold coins. So she slowly stopped and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already safe anyway..." The girl thought, but her heart jumped faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is still standing, looking at her like a wolf staring at the prey, laughing very calmly and confidently. A beautiful leather purse is jumping up and down in his right hand, constantly making a splash of gold coins. The money bag is not big, but it is enough to swell. When I saw it at first sight, Irene determined her initial judgment, at least two hundred gold coins. And rich experience, keen perception and dim environment, let the girl discover that the purse is emitting a faint magical light. This is a purse made from enchanted leather! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather that can be enchanted is very expensive, and it is even rarer to make a purse with enchanted leather. It is not a direct family of true family aristocracy, and it is simply unable to support such extravagant behavior. The money bag enchantment can be a 'space' that increases the actual storage capacity, or a 'lightness' that makes the weight and content lighter, and secondly a 'durable', even the worst purely decorative 'flash'. It will make a purse far more valuable than the gold itself that it can hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s smile is more like a viper, and the frog feels powerless to escape. "I just touched you, so these are the rewards you deserve. Come, come over, take it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene only feels dry in the throat I can't say a word. She really wanted to turn around and run, but her feet moved a little bit in the direction of Stevenson, and the various chaotic thoughts kept hitting each other in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't force me any more, and he has touched me just now, so this money is just a kind of compensation for what has happened, isn't it..." Irene suddenly found herself when the thoughts were in chaos. Unexpectedly, I came to Stevenson. And Stevenson seemed to know what she was thinking, grabbed her hand directly, put the purse in her hand, and said with a demon smile: "The purse is also yours."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I..." Irene felt that her throat couldn’t say a complete sentence, she felt that everything was not right, but she couldn’t tell where it was. wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you need money now, and the deep blue tradition is about fair and voluntary transactions. So I will give you a suggestion if..." Vinson paused, his eyes swept over the girl's body from top to bottom, and immediately let her fight a chill, then said: "If you can maintain your current state of mind, accompany me to bed, you will definitely get a satisfaction. The return. For example, I can repay all the debts for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I can't..." Irene shook her head hard, her face Pale, step by step back, but the hand is holding the purse tightly, the finger joints have become too white due to too much force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson stood with his hand, and did not force her to do anything, but said: "No hurry, you can think slowly. My suggestion It works for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene suddenly turned and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Stevenson, Minnie appeared as a ghost. Her pale eyes stared at the girl who was far away, and said coldly: "This kind of person living in the bottom edge area can do anything for money. What do you think is this kind of thing? If so, Then you can touch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson suddenly smiled and said in a low voice: "Our marriage contract has been established, according to the rules, now I want to know how How can you touch you when you touch you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled Minnie to the front and inserted his right hand directly into her mage robe, slamming hard. Minnie's face has become pale because of anger, but struggle and resistance are in vain. Seventeen-year-old Stevenson is strong and completely suppresses Minnie, who is still a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher won't let you go!" Minnie cried a little hysterically. She kicked and kicked in vain, seemingly completely forgotten, she was a magician, or a young girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher?" Stevenson sneered and said, "If you don't have the support of the Soram family, can you still pay the deep blue tuition?" In a month's time, there have been too many changes. Without the help of our Soram, the Marquis of Neo may not even be able to keep his territory. He now wants to replace every gold coin with an enchanted arrow, and spares no effort to support one. The genius daughter who is studying in dark blue? Don't be naive. If he really has the ability, how can he sell you to Soram?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this 'sell' The word, Minnie’s face was pale and pale. In the case of transactions behind the paper, the exchange of interests and urgency is almost inconsistent with the sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have me, dear Miss Minnie, you are living in a deep blue freehand life, the dazzling aura of the legendary mage's pro-disciples, tomorrow will be gone! You really Is the consideration clear?” Stevenson’s words were as cold as the hell, and Minnie’s body was stiff and struggling. And his hand is as cold as the sound, slowly sliding down. "Dear Miss Minnie, if you think about it, please separate your legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
