It’s almost the same, those who are not dead... I see a lot of people standing in your team, so there won’t be anyone who dares to offend you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I hope so." Richard nodded, his hand waving in front, saying: "We come from the ectopic face, but it is not the devil who kills and destroys. Don't be the god of the weak courage. Deception, we also have the gods standing behind, and more powerful! Flowing sand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand flowing up, opening the book of time, a god The blessing fell on the old mayor. The mayor looked shocked, and the townspeople clearly saw a brilliant light falling on the mayor. The light is extremely bright, bright and warm. Although it has the vicissitudes of time, it is full of vitality and vitality. It shows that the camp of the true God is not darkness and evil. Blessing is only a simple auxiliary technique, not at all the core of the system of the gods like various treatments or curses. But in low-level magic, its light and shadow effect is the most striking and brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the magical effect with my own eyes, and the townspeople immediately rioted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard seized the opportunity and said loudly: "The purpose of our arrival is to follow the guidance and glory of the true God! So from now on, the town of Jovan is my territory. I, Richard Archimonde, is here and your lord, all the industries where Sir David and the Baron of Fossa are here, I will accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the Li Declaration was issued, the townspeople relaxed. The battle between the nobles is a frequent occurrence, and most of them are local residents who have lived for generations, and a small number are free people with craftsmanship. No matter who is the lord, they are all the people, there will be no change in life, just paying more taxes and less. However, in the battles before and after, many soldiers died under Richard, especially those militiamen. Their relatives are basically locals, and they will naturally hate Richard. This kind of hatred made up of blood hatred is difficult to resolve. Richard is very clear that he does not want to resolve it. Just look at them with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor asked a key question: "Mr. Richard, are you planning to permanently turn this into your territory?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the old mayor and said with a deep meaning: "Of course! But I have another resident, I will leave soon. When I am not here, how can I do it?" Yours. When I come back, don't let me down. Now, hand over the taxes that you had to hand over to the High Covenant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The mayor is bitter and is trying to explain a few words that have not yet reached the traditional tax collection. There was a sharp cry in the townspeople behind him: "You devils of these ectopic faces, get out of our world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teen The teenager screamed and waved the short sword that I did not know where to find it, rushing to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, come back!" The young man followed him to run a middle-aged man, and his strong body and dark skin showed good strength. He wants to stop the boy, but he is one step late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the god of courage!" The young man shouted and jumped up and threw himself at Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his body suddenly lost strength in the air, and fell to the ground halfway, twitching a few times, and then no longer move. From the position of the heart of his back, a thin wound slowly appeared, and the blood was slowly pouring out of the wound, dyeing the clothes on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is standing in the same place, it seems that it has never been moved, but the guide of the perpetual sleep does not know when to squirt. At this moment, a drop of blood is dripping from the tip of the knife. In addition, the edge of the blade seems to have just been polished, leaving no The slightest trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son! I am fighting with you!" The brawny eyes are covered with bloodshot eyes, wielding a huge fist, striding forward to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl seems to have moved again, and then the already-cleaned guide of the eternal sleeper has another drop of blood on the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan struggled and took two more steps before he fell to the feet of the mayor. The blood quickly soaked the sole of the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have not seen the newly added two bodies, just faintly said to the mayor: "Is it seen? I never make a hollow threat, I Patience and dignity are not to be provocative. I just do things according to the tradition of the nobility, but if you don't want to be my lord, you must become my enemy, that is, you are forcing me to become a devil. The devil does not need to be a confidant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Please wait a moment, I will give you the tax payable in the next season." The mayor bitterly. Walk back to your own small building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard took the tax of the next season of Jovan Town: one hundred gold coins, two World of Warcraft fur and two boxes of books, leaving the town. These two books are all the books that can be found in the town of Jovan, all kinds of types, they are filled with the tax of three hundred gold coins. In the view of the mayor, it is a good thing that these books, which together add only one or twenty gold coins, can be filled with three hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty descendants followed him away, and they received even more gaze than Richard during the entire tax collection process. Almost every descendant has a familiar person in the town of Jovan. After all, the territory is so large. For decades, the people affiliated with the territory have long formed intricate relationships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who have been infected with blood have no retreat and have to follow Richard to continue the battle. Compared with those townspeople who dared to rush to Richard, they have extinguished the will to resist. The soldiers who saw the ogre and the fast beast know that all the resistance is in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the next day at noon, the baron’s reinforcements arrived in the town of Jovan. This is an army of hundreds of people, on the scale far more than Sir Mintel's troops, but the army is only three captains, and there are only ten veterans in the army. It can be said that the combat strength of this army, which is piled up by numbers, is actually far less than the one that Mintai was eliminated. This is also the reason why they have gone through a whole day without a road of less than 20 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron has already dispatched more than half of the army in the collar. It is said that it should be led by a jazz, but when Gao is missing, the news of Mintai and Huber’s death is returned. After that, the remaining two jazz suddenly fell ill, and it is said that even the bed could not be lowered. Naturally, they could not come out to bring the soldiers to bump. The baron himself has passed the age of fifty, and the strength of the eightth level is a high-grade cannon fodder on the battlefield, and it is even more impossible to lead the troops. So in the end, three of the three most sinners were put on the line of fire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the outpost team repeatedly confirmed that the invaders had left the town of Jovan, the army rumbling into the town and re-accepted the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After figuring out what Richard has done here, the three captains are furious and find that the mayor and the townspeople have colluded with the invaders. Suspect. After whipping, arresting and threatening, the captives received a tax twice the amount collected by Richard, in order to prove that they were innocent and returned to the baron. Of course, in front of them, it is impossible to use books to borrow such things to cover taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
