			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner walked out from the inside again, with six bottles on the tray in his hand Homemade whiskey. The speed of his wine is not fast enough to catch up with the speed of the ogre drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This wine is my private collection, the taste is very different, but be careful, its stamina is very powerful." The tavern owner reminded me diligently. But to listen to that tone, it is better to say that it is awkward. The situation is clear, the three guests on this table can drink all his stock and make him a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed snoring, grabbed the tray, placed it on the table, grabbed a bottle, reached out and screwed the bottleneck directly Pour in the throat. The spirits went into the throat, and it was filled with the taste of a fruit tree. It was mellow and lubricated, and it was much better than the previous wine. Moreover, there is a strong scent of stamina in the wine, a bottle of belly, a little bit of familiarity in a moment, a little comfortable dizziness. His belly moved and he made a loud wine cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door of the pub was opened, and the two people entered the pub in tandem. Look at their costumes, which are common bounty hunters in blood-stained areas, that is, guards, bodyguards, and horses are doing everything, relying on the profession of making money. They are obviously two-way, the first four people seized a good position, so the three people behind are very dissatisfied. There are only two tables left in the pub, and each one is adjacent to the three-pointer and the Oral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to approach the ogre, even if it is a good-tempered ogre most of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bounty hunters muttered something in their mouths, but the night was already deep, they didn’t seem to want to find another place, so they chose a table to sit. It’s down. When one of them turned around, the action was a little bigger, the cloak was flying, and he passed the three-pointed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! You met me!" said the three-pointer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, man, there is a narrow place here." The hunter said with apologetic and fear. His companions also watched nervously together, but no one dared to make a misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer thinking about it, and it’s a thing of the past. Oral also ignored the hunters and didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-point cooked wine is now rushing up, making him feel very good. After a series of battles, the three-pointer feels that his body is full of strength, and after a while, he can try to hit the thirteenth level barrier. And his activity in the body is greatly increased, which is a sign of variation. Although there was no variation at the 12th level, the 13th level was also good. After all, only one or two of the ten ogre can produce mutations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he felt that the back of the neck seemed to be itchy, like a mosquito sip, so he reached out and scratched and cursed a few crazy mosquitoes. . The blood-stained land is really different, and it can breed mosquitoes that can pierce the ogre thick skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two tables of hunters sat down and asked for wine and meals, and began to drink and brag, and said the various anecdotes in the adventure, always laughing. Let the atmosphere of the pub be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed and happy with Oral: "You don't know, at that time, old Nazl made me and Tiramisu eat a lot of roots every day. Things that are mixed with the blades of grass. That thing is really hard to eat! But the old Nazir said that if you eat every day, you can gradually become smarter. What is the use of smart? Dealing with powerful enemies, or power is more useful. The guy can withstand my hammer. Tiramisu has always been smarter than me, but he has never beaten me, just learned magic. Right, Little Oral, you know, Old Nazl said I can also learn magic. But I hate posing, standing there like a goose, oh, of course, the owner is the exception. I prefer to use a wooden stick to break the enemy's head straight!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
