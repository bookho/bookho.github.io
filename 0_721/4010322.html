			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers on the side of Richard have already conducted targeted training in advance and should How to deal with it is always in mind, the effect of the first strike is exactly the same as expected, when the next burly warrior jumped out of the steel barrier, a heavy axe squatted on the landing owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his strength and his hand was a fine heavy axe, and now he left a huge wound on the crow's body, almost cut it. In two halves, one strike, the warrior did not go to see if the woodcrow died, and immediately returned to the back of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the bird's web is really effective against the woodcrow, Richard is truly assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the forest is already a raging wind, one after another, the crow flies from the depths of the forest, circling around the tree of life, piercing The sound was overwhelming, and the soldiers were dizzy and couldn’t help but want to reach out and block their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of crows is increasing, and finally the entire sky is covered, and the forest is dim as if it has entered the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha narrowed his eyes, his eyes glanced at the sky, and the numbers jumped in his mind, rising, and the crows hovering in the air had reached There are as many as four thousand, but there is still a certain gap with the 10,000 that the tree of life says. However, in the depths of the forest, there are clusters of crows flying in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the crows of the crows who had hovered in the air but had not launched an attack. They made a decisive decision and ordered twenty magic archers to start shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful armored arrow swayed up and passed through the body of the crows with great precision. On the spot, twenty crows fell from the sky, in the air. The crows of the crows rioted and uttered an extremely angry scream, and then a group of hundreds of crows, who were crushed by black, swooped and slammed into the magic archers. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crows attacked the tree of life in the past, the guardian elves generally did not dare to take the initiative to attack the crows, and must wait until the crows were nailed into The tree of life will only start behind the tree. Only this time, the defense of the crow is the most vulnerable, and it can be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of biological temperament is extremely fierce. Once it is attacked and not killed, it will immediately turn the target from the tree of life to the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if the tree of life is successfully promoted, it will be attacked by the crows, and it will take a long time to recover. This is a long time, at least ten. Calculated in units of years, Richard certainly can't wait for so long, and he is not a guardian elf, and will not dare to attack the crows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of crows have just passed the tree of life, and hundreds of unmoving bird-eaters on this side suddenly sprayed spider webs, and hundreds of spider webs eventually It constitutes a huge net, almost all the crows are wrapped in, only a dozen flying in the edge to escape in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magic archer has long escaped the barrier and replaced a group of soldiers with thickened heavy shields. They jumped out in a training manner, first using The shield took the woodpecker to the ground, and then added an axe to it, and then kicked it to the periphery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are constantly fallen by the cobwebs, and the warriors are acting in a neat and tidy manner. If they do not want to kill the crows completely, they will lose their actions as long as they are seriously injured. Ability is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows of the crows in the air are completely violent, they are gathering their wings, swooping down, and rushing to the bird-eating spiders that are covered with the tree of life, greet them. A large piece of cobwebs, the crows dive quickly, and the bird-eating spider spouts the spider web faster. In less than half a second, each bird-eater spider squirts at least three spider webs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of crows caught by spider webs in the blink of an eye, falling to the ground, and more crows have broken through the spider web defenses of the bird-eaters. Closed the sharp bird's beak, like a sword, a bird-eater spider on the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the bird-eaters actually showed agility that was not commensurate with their size, and they bounced from the tree of life and swung back to the woodcrow. Using a mouthpart and biting down, the crow's feather-like feathers are shaped under the mouthparts of the bird's spider, bitten open by the carcass, and then special venom is injected into the body along the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few fast-acting bird spiders that are not fast enough to be worn by the crows, and they are nailed to the branches of the tree of life, but the life of the bird-eater is abnormal. Powerful, struggling to counterattack, most of them successfully sent the mouthparts into the crows who nailed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their body fluids are highly toxic to the wood crows, extremely corrosive, and abalone is screaming, and feathers and flesh are eroded at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one after another, the crows in the sky swooped down and nailed them to the bird-eaters, finally letting these bird-eaters lose. The life, but the wood crows that have been stained with the bird's body fluids have only passed for a moment, and they have fallen from the tree of life, and then twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already chaos around the tree of life. More than two thousand bird-eating spiders and the number of crows who are doubled themselves are fighting, they are fighting in various places. In the air, on the tree, fight in every place that is suitable and unsuitable for combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbers are more ferocious than the powerful crows, they are often torn by the crows, leaving only half of the body, but still biting The crow crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird's spider is almost full of weapons all over the body, and many of the crows tear the flesh of the bird's spider, so they swallow it directly, but that's all. The crows that were made did not fall out of the air for a long time. As long as they fell to the ground, the warriors like wolves would rush to the top of the battlefield and send them to the periphery of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows are still coming in endlessly, and they are constantly coming into the battlefield, and they are falling all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s face has become a bit uncomfortable, because now, the crows who have entered the battlefield have more than 10,000, with the bird-eater Constantly dying, the pressure on Richard's warriors and guardian elves is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the sky has begun to flash the magic and magic of the light, all the soldiers have begun to fight, although there have been no major casualties, but However, people have been injured all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Richard, the elf knife is constantly flashing. From time to time, a crow is picked up from the air. He immediately communicates with the tree of life and roars: "You are not It’s said that there are only 10,000 crows, now it’s one thousand two, what’s going on.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the tree of life is also a bit flustered, saying: “should It is the world tree, it must be it. It must have been aware of the relationship between us, so this time the crows are surprisingly many. At other times, it can't deal with me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world tree... well, there will be more crows, I have to listen to the truth." Lichao shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to 17,000, there are only so many crows in this area." The tree of life quickly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, the flash of light flashed coldly and said coldly: "Well, if I have a crow, I will retreat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The sound of the tree of life also began to reveal a hot rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cut off the connection of the tree of life and continued to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cloud of fire from time to time, and the sound of dragons is also resounding in the sky, Carlo has appeared in the air, but this time it seems quite wolf. The huge dragon's body is covered with dense crows, and it is constantly eating its flesh and blood. The sturdy dragon scales are very fragile at this time, and they can't stand the crows, even though each wound is right. Carlo is as small as a needle tip, but the group of wood crows covering nearly one-third of his body is like a blanket of blankets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Carlos is out, there will be a large crow of wood crows burning and falling, but they are too many, almost impossible to kill. The point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Li’s eyes were all the fierce figure of the woodcrow, and all the ears heard were squeaky squeaks, and there were one or two sounds in between. Screaming, the elf knife in his hand was so flying, a crow was pierced, or cut, and after a long time of research, the fighting art finally reached a step, now human In terms of the standards of the kingdom war professional, Richard is already a master of fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is unknowingly past, Richard has no idea how many crows he has killed, he and Nyris, Agamemnon are now back Relying on the back, it constitutes a small circle of war, protecting the sand in the center, and in all directions, all around them, all of them are crows, and Richard’s body is full of blood, own, and there are also Nyris and Aga. The Mennon, the three people have long known that they have blocked each other's attacks, and they are completely unable to calculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of defense on the ground has become a mess, the soldiers are divided into dozens of large and small circles, the gods and mages are protected in the middle, and endless The crow crow is killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
