In addition, there is no news of other reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Earl's face Great change, anger said: "The two old things that are not promised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch was hate to say: "They thought the garrison border It is possible to clear up our relationship with us, and wait for Richard to make a fuss, maybe he will give them a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finril’s face suddenly Change, muttered a few times "the garrison border", his face was gloomy, said coldly: "The two old guys are sinister enough. They were still reinforcements. Now that the situation has changed, it has changed. Become a vulture, just wait for Richard to leave, and you will bite a few pieces of meat from us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenrill thought about it and said :" At this time, the messengers of the two old guys have already arrived in front of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evero and other silver sword lords are all face-changing, Richard However, there is no foundation, this war is going on, the worst result is nothing more than the silver sword to accept the indemnity, and at most cut the block to the ground, Richard can not station troops here, the most use of this land tribute production In the name of the year to send some benefits in the past, maybe even with the Archimonde family to establish a long-term relationship, but if they join hands with the two counts on the western border, they can directly dismember the silver sword territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the atmosphere suppressed, Finril snorted heavily and said: "Whatever you fear, as long as the Swordwind City is still there, the family's costume knight is still there. We have not lost our roots, even if we let those two old things take up a few pieces of land, and when the silver sword family recovers, they will always repay them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old Earl’s words clearly spurred some morale and made everyone feel refreshed. However, one question was lingering in the hearts of some people, hiding the knights in the city to avoid losses, really Right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question, Nyris just asked Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard asked: "If you are Finril, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris frowns, after a moment, said: "I will put The reconnaissance units are distributed throughout the territory, and then the heavy troops are placed in several important castles. They can’t stand up, and then concentrate the most elite troops, maneuver in the wild, and choose the opportunity to fight with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Non't wait for Richard to express his opinion, Nyris kept shaking his head: "This is not the case. The point that the silver sword can be assembled is elite. If you fight in the wild with your thousand rides, the loser will account for 90%. Damn, you have too many knights, there are too many knights, and spearmen... Fortunately, their blasting spears have run out, no, there is tiramisu, he It shouldn't be on the battlefield, hell, twilight, I'm sure, when I fight you, she will probably insert a knife behind me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing that Nyris is more excited, Richard laughs and pats his shoulder and says, "I will fight with you, and I will use the twilight gang." "I cut you in half a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris a little face swelled red, angered: "Half minutes, we want to try. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so angry that Richard actually jumped his heart faster and quickly looked at his eyes and said, "I am an instant break, really if After a deadly battle, the first few knives can't cut you down, I am in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is almost the same." Neris said a little embarrassed, then pulled Living in Richard, he said: "Really, how should you deal with you more than a thousand people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li said helplessly: "One is like you said In that way, concentrate all the elite and fight with me, but if the strength is equal, the other party will generally not have the chance to win me. The other is to concentrate the strength of the absolute advantage, attack the place I have to defend, and force me to fight in an unfavorable situation, for example Black Rose Castle, or which one is not to be lost, the last one is to summon enough strong people to directly kill me. Just fine, now I am satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris snorted and put his hand on Richard’s shoulder and said, "You can do it with all your heart." Try your best, let me go first, this time, what should we do now, is it boring in this small town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why Suddenly, he smacked Neris's hand quietly and said, "Of course not, let the troops rest for another day, then we should go to Jianfeng City to visit the Count of Finlay, and the silver sword has been wasted. This week has reached my limit. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the troops of Richard occupy a small town called Fenghuo. The small town is surrounded by mountains and waters, and the city is only a hundred kilometers away from Jianfeng City. In an hour, you can enter Jianfeng City. Fenghuo was originally a baron’s territory. Now it falls into the hands of Richard. The baron is locked up with a bunch of silver sword lords. As for the private army of the 3,000-year-old baron, In the battle, dozens of people died in battle, more than 100 people were wounded and surrendered 2,800. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Nyris are very ruthlessly requisitioning the Baron’s castle, which is very refined, apparently from the hands of art masters, regardless of architecture, sculpture and The gardens are all remarkable, the only drawback is that the defense is almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, after talking with Nyris, Richard is preparing to go to see the troops, and see a costume knight hurried into, saying: "Richard Adults, there are two people who want to see you. They claim to be the messengers of Robert and the Earl of Hiltus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sneer and said: "Then Can the two old foxes finally wait? It seems that the patience is even worse than I expected. Nyris, let’s come together and see what the two old foxes are going to say.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scenic living room of Fenghuo Castle, the two messengers wished to see Richard, they did not want to appreciate the beauty, because it was already shocked by Richard’s military prestige, from the war to the present The number of casualties of the Richards was less than 100, but it defeated the tens of thousands of troops of the Silver Sword, and in addition to Jianfeng City, other cities were expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of the talks was very simple. The two messengers knew that people like Richard were the most impatient and wasted time, so they came to the door and expressed the goodwill of the two counts. And concealedly, they are willing to share the interests of the Silver Sword family with Richard and become a loyal ally of Richard in the western frontier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the messenger, Richard smiled and said: "The two old foxes, you go back and tell them, I will attack Swordwind City the day after tomorrow, if their If the army can't appear in the city and fight with me, then everything is free. The interests of the silver sword family are mine. If they want to move my cheese, it is best to think carefully. I have always been vengeful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the messengers was ugly and couldn’t help but say: "Richard, cooperation is good for us. Is this plan too harsh? Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said faintly: "If you want to come to the body, you still need to consider eating, silver sword I will swallow it alone, if your master wants to share some benefits, then you have to pay the corresponding price, If you don’t do anything, you want to sit and share. They also want to look at themselves too high. You will bring my original words back. The day after tomorrow, if I can’t see their army under Jianfeng City, then I don’t want to step into it. The silver sword took a step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two messengers left and went, Niris asked: "I really want to attack Jianfeng City." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris thought about it and said, "You may not be playing." Got it, and even if it is laid down, the loss must be very heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahe smiled and said: "We can make a bet, I will be able to play The next broken city, and the loss will not exceed two hundred, all arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris snorted and said: "What are you gambling? Come "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that the chest was suddenly hit, and even half of the syllables could not be released, and the breathing could not stop, he blocked it. For a long time, I was slowed down, staring at Nyris, looking left and right, and even shining in the eyes, I have already used insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has a feeling of being stared at by the ancient savage beast. The whole body is chilling and exclaimed: "You...what are you doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the insight, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and said with a smile: "I want to see if you are your own Nyris." The tone in the chest has not completely dissipated, he did not even notice that he used a respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four emperors have their eyebrows upside down and angered: "Can this still be fake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he touched his chin, he thought, "I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the usual charm of Nyris is amazing. Now, the appearance of this anger, the lethality has soared to the level of Su Helun and Qi Qi. Nyris belongs to the type that the expression is richer and the charm is more difficult to resist, so it was excited by Richard. When angry and angry, Richard will be more and more eye-catching, but this is enjoyment and torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
