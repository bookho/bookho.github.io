			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the high-powered jazz’s too powerful combat power has an explanation, not His own squadrons, most of those elite veterans are warriors of the baron. In general, the martial arts will acquire the first professional class skills at the fifth level. Whether it is precise shooting or strong smashing, they will increase their strength. A five-level veteran can deal with three, five, three or four fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plane is very similar to Noland, and there are also a large number of intelligent races, but the difference is that humans dominate. At least in the area around the Principality of White Rock. In line with Noland, the human kingdom is a system with equal hereditary and military power. In addition to being born in the giants, the superior way is also a way to obtain powerful force through cultivation and bloody battles. Therefore, the style of Shangwu is similar to that of Noland. But this is undoubtedly another bad news for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of the White Rock is the god of courage, which is the god that has not been heard of the sand. It should be the native god of the plane, from the believer. The quantity should be a medium god. In addition to the god of courage, there are five or six similar gods circulating in the human kingdom, and the ancestor worship is also very common in humans, and it is not inferior to the orcs and elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron of Fossa is a believer in the god of courage, and his temple has a temple of courage. This time it was the priest of the god of courage who got the gods, so the Baron Fossa dispatched the nearest high jazz squad to set off to search for the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Baron’s main force will attack later, if the High Jazz loses, they are the follow-up force<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Licha and Liusha went to the open space in the base, and Richard moved out of the table, and the sand was laid on the table just after the map was made according to the mouth of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the forward base is not bad or bad, about five kilometers from the terminal of the mountain road. The rugged terrain and dense jungle shrubs make it impossible for powerful cavalry to enter, even if it is a high-caliber jazz or a knight, it can only walk to the forward base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current position of the forward base is on a somewhat abrupt high ground, with steep slopes on three sides, and only the base main entrance is a gentle ramp. The height of the steepest slope reaches 20 meters. Unless it is a sealed knight, it is difficult for ordinary soldiers to climb. Overall, the forward base can be said to be easy to defend. The only problem is that once you retreat to the base, it is equal to being trapped in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li researched the map, after repeated calculations, pointed to the town less than 20 kilometers away from the base, saying: "If the baron's army has already started, Then you should arrive here tonight. This is the last place to recharge and rest before entering the mountains, and then tomorrow morning, they will go into the mountains to search for our trail. If we scout this night, we will know The enemy's general strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, they are likely to bring the priest of courage, he must be the target of the first order kill. But I don't know if there will be a magician." Liu Sha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao snorted and looked at the distribution of towns and villages across the baron’s territory on the map. He calculated it silently and said, “It’s less than a day now. It’s not too awkward for the High Jazz to return the news in time. According to normal judgment, the Jazz’s team is improved in configuration, and it is unlikely that they will be fully shackled in their concept, so the Baron Fossa should not They came out of the nest. The gods mentioned our number and strength, but they wouldn’t think that we have so many people who are good at tracking and killing, so we lost little in the first battle. In combination, we may face It should be at most one-third of the baron's strength, about two jazz, more than a dozen sealed knights, plus two or three hundred fighters. This is the most likely situation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
