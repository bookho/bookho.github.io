			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outer edge of the position, the earth is surging, only staying in most people The fascinating scene in the scene occurred, a group of undead creatures crawling out of the ground, powerful black warriors and death knights coming out of the portal in groups, and the bodies of the warring soldiers on both sides were constantly shaking. From the ground up, although the grade of Sandre has declined, the control of the undead army has not declined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little further, the locusts began to appear, they kept laying down the knights and the knights, and Richard immediately took over the command of the unit. Right, within two minutes, the two knights were mixed into a assault formation, and then slowly progressed. When passing by Clark and other priests, the priests blessed the knights with dazzling magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth roared again, and the squadron, which was mixed with the knights and the knights, began to charge, and the emperor’s generals and powerful faces changed instantly. They all saw that every knight’s rifle spiked constantly spurred the vindictive light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team of knights, do everyone have the strength of being close to the town's strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the worst of the deepest nightmare! But the emperor has no extra time to think about it, the team’s knight has already rushed in. Their army array suddenly provoked a large blood wave. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after rushing into the empire, the formation of the formation of the knights did not slow down at all, but still close to full speed intensive The crowd is running, and it seems that even the mountains in the road ahead will hit the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s long guns are constantly waving, making a whistling whistle, and the flickering temper on the front of the gun pulls out a piece of gorgeous light arc in the air. The emperor's warriors swept up in pieces and then cut them into several pieces in the air. The team's knights were like a hot knife and cut into butter. It was extremely smooth and easy to cut the emperor's battle and cut dozens of pieces. During the second breath, it penetrated the army of thousands of people and killed it from the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark emperor’s array clearly left a bloody scar, marking the bloody path of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that sharp sharp edge, slowed down in a corner of the army, a few simple turning movements, the front and rear teams exchanged, again pulled into Attacking the trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of the Iron Triangle Empire were completely stunned. This was the first time they saw a large-scale installation of the Knights. In the face of the knights, the army became a simple number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the empire went up to the generals, down to the ordinary soldiers, suddenly panic, a few generals who could remain awake screamed, trying to scream Let the soldiers calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the one who was supposed to stand out and settle down in the heart of the army, sat on the horse, staring blankly at the cross. The bloody scars in the army, he knows, how to make the soldiers calm and useless, and once again the same rushing, this elite force will fall into complete chaos, in the face of such force, ordinary soldiers The array is just a number of casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth began to vibrate again, and the demonic Cavaliers re-initiated the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights once again opened the emperor’s array, plowing the bleeding waves, killing them from the other end faster than they just did, they are still counting A hundred meters away from the horse head, re-arranged, the rifle slowly flattened, and began to charge for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor finally became chaotic, and the soldiers who were on the road of the knight’s assault hurriedly fled to both sides, wanting to leave this line of death, their The rushing caused confusion around the area and then spread to the entire army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic, stop them, they are tired, can't rush for the third time." A general used his best to call, he was a few still The general who was able to stay awake, and his guards also tried to gather around, not completely broken, but he did not call a few times, the twilight was attached to him behind the ghost, and he dug out his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the knights in the distance is not the third charge. The speed and momentum are not obvious compared with the first time. Even the temperament of the rifle guns was not bleak, and the emperor team was completely confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this irresistible, totally slaughtering charge, it’s hard to keep calm and calm, no one knows these demonic The Cavaliers are also able to charge a few times. They only know that the people who are on the path of the charge can't escape. Although the two full-scale assaults have surpassed Faro's military common sense, most of the Imperial soldiers have no fighting spirit to block or may be the last. Once the charge, not everyone has the courage to block the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the retreat finally sounded, and the emperor ** retreated as the tide, and Richard did not pursue it. Instead, the 100-member knights were lined up in a line and watched the emperor go far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of troops in the eyes of hundreds of knights to withdraw from the emperor, it is particularly ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this embarrassment is still satisfied with Richard, the construction of the Cavaliers only lost two rides, and the three thousand defended border garrisons have one thousand two Hundreds, all the battalion combat units in the garrison army were killed, and the emperor ** lost an astonishing 11,000 people, of which about 4,000 people died under Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not far from the legendary Richard, the damage on the battlefield is huge, but Richard does not feel much, he thought of the legendary mage, if it is Su Here, Helen, a space burst, can send the entire army to heaven, and His Highness Su Hailun is already a person who can change the course of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops of Richard are still gathering, and the stars and the scorpions have spared no effort to fly repeatedly, and a group of squadrons can be transported every three hours. After half a day, Richard has assembled an army of two thousand Knights of the Sui Feng. Such a team, together with all the followers, is enough to fight with the remnants of Salenville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard no longer waited for the rest of the troops to assemble, and chased it, finally catching up with Saranwell in the territory of the Iron Triangle Empire for more than 100 kilometers. The army was resting at the time, morale was extremely low, and there was no thought that there would be a surprise attack. Two thousand wicked knights repeatedly trampled three rounds back and forth in the camp, finally letting the entire army collapse, the soldiers fled, and Saranwell once again smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire’s Zhongqiang Guoqiang almost died in the last battle, and now the remaining mages and strongmen died on the spot. One third escaped, and the other one surrendered. Most of the soldiers fled. They may regroup somewhere in the depths of the empire, but Richard does not care more than three or three thousand people. Returning to the army and joining the army of the Principality that is gathering at the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, the days of the entire Iron Triangle Empire are cloudy, deep and heavy lead clouds are scattered over the entire empire, and some places seem to be low Touching the spires of some tall buildings, the chilly wind blew, let people have to wrap their clothes, and cursed the weather of the ghosts, it is summer, but these days it is as cold as late autumn . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnificent palace of the empire, even at noon, there must be a large number of torches and magic lights, one for lighting and two for heating. Some centuries-old halls of discussion have already opened the fire magic array that will be opened in winter. It adds warmth and warmth to the whole hall, but the atmosphere in the temple is heavily suppressed. The heat of magic is difficult to eliminate the chill in people's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Masters are busy setting up magic maps. Since the rise of the Principality of the Red Clan in an incredible gesture, everything in Richard has become the object of research. In particular, his military words and deeds were used for detailed analysis and careful study. The magic map that Richard's preference was quickly popularized, and became the standard equipment of every general commander in the entire northwestern continent, as if there was no A magic map shows that it is not a famous star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short period of time, the local mages association finally succumbed to reality and began to provide the original components of the magic map in bulk, if they still stick to the rules, some The scattered magic workshop will completely monopolize this market, and the supply chain of magical items has always been closely related to the dignitaries, the royal family and the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Triangle Imperial Family has been using traditional leather hand-painted maps for centuries and has been replaced with magic maps in the last three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic map was finally set up and lit up. Several mages were relieved and hurriedly retired. The map is on the territory around the empire. All are good, especially in the east, Li Shilongtu has already reached the sea, and firmly control the seaport. In another two years, a large-scale port will be completed, which will become the cornerstone of the rise of the Imperial Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everyone’s eyes are concentrated in the southwest, which is the area where the Crimson Principality is located. On the map, the color of the Crimson Principality has been changed. From deep red to bright red, until now with some faint red color, but no matter how the color is changed, people feel the same glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white-haired old man opened a roll of leather scrolls and read: "The third and seventh empire of the empire have been assembled and ready to go. 6. The 11th and 2nd Independence Legion are mobilizing and are expected to be completed in three days..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of boring numbers makes people feel drowsy, The emperor was old, his pale hair and deep wrinkles made him look like a coveted lion. He suddenly took a handful of armrests and angered: "I still read these useless things," /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
