This kind of reward is enough for most ordinary people. It is the heart of some senior professionals. ** bubble! book. Bar* With the elite bat, the contact between Richard and the Bluewater Oasis base is not a problem. The person who wants to bounty informs the left-behind person of Richard in the blue water oasis, and the intelligence will be transmitted to Richard in the middle of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second-class caravan has a small number of trucks, less than ten, which looks like a small caravan with no oil and water. But as many as three hundred guards have exposed its true value. The strong escort power and the red Cossack flag are enough for the caravan to cross the entire bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, they jumped out of a knight in front of the thick fog, just in the way they are on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the caravan jumped a few times, waved the caravan to stop, and ordered all the guards to enter the defense state. At the same time, several news hawks were released. He has been in the bloody land for many years, knowing that the other party has seen the red Cossack's banner and dare to block the road, it must be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stopped the warhorse, looked at the second-class caravan opposite, and did not care to wait for them to lay the defensive formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the caravans were all defensive, Richard raised his hand to the caravan and said faintly: "killing the light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a team of soldiers crossed Richard and listed them as a strict array, pressing on the caravan! The first row is the barbarian warrior with a heavy shield. The next row is the throwing soldier, then the wild elf and the demon gun shooter, and then the elite infantry of the demon gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bow and arrow confrontation, the wild elf and the demon gun shooter easily suppressed the opponent's shooter, but when the hundred throwing soldiers entered the range, the sky immediately sounded Grating whistling! Looking at the axe rain that almost swayed to cover the sky, all the caravan guards changed their faces! The walls of those trucks can't stop such a terrible flying axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power, even if Richard does not deliberately manipulate, can also completely kill this caravan guard. Not long after the time passed, it was Richard who never thought that his power would expand so quickly. In the face of a rather strong opponent, he could kill the light by saying "killing light". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard no longer pays attention to the battle of the caravan, but slowly turns to the horse. Even the first round of the axe that the guards can withstand the throwing soldiers can't stop the second and third rounds. When the throwing throwers throw all the throwing axe, those guards can survive half of the luck. The throwing soldiers who get the elf wars blessings only need to be scaled, no matter how they describe their abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is waiting for someone else to kill a trio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot wind blew from the red land and rolled the gravel, but there was no other in Richard’s field of vision. . However, Richard does not fully believe his own eyes. He knows the art of fighting in the dark world. He knows that there are many ways to deceive the opponent's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard relies not only on his own eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, three huge bats were wiped across the ground, and the shock waves that could not be heard by the human ear rolled on the ground. So in Richard's consciousness, there were more than a dozen fuzzy humanoid contours, and he was touched by his position, which was less than 100 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s smile suddenly brought the cold of the winter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower sand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ray of light is almost at the same time as Richard’s drink, Fall on him. The exclusive magic of flowing sand, boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of burning, while igniting the war of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s face is snarled, roaring like a thunderous sound: “Black Wing!!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blackwing! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackwing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackwing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard actually provoked in the bloody land The echoes are echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve fireballs spewed out and connected in the air into a striking line of fire, pointing to a point! The high temperature distorted the space, and the ambiguous lines seemed to pull out a sneaky figure. That's right, it's people! A shadow appeared on the empty sand that was originally empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the black wing face has been completely distorted by the horror, and the pupils are all prosperous and prolonged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wave spreads and extends silently until it fills up all areas within 100 meters. With such a wide coverage area, the black wing could not escape without any loss by the teleport. The transpiration of the flame at the same time distorted the line of sight. He could not see where the safety line was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if the coverage is not so broad, the Black Wing can't get out of the fire. He is still in a state of strong stealth and has limited speed. When the black wing is found to be wrong, the first fireball has been shot in front of it and exploded. He instinctively launched the vindictive resistance, indirectly was blown out of the hidden form, and the continuous follow-up impact, so that he can only maintain the vindictive resistance, can not do other actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the endless twelve fireballs, the Black Wings can hardly believe their eyes! If there is still a trace of lucidity in his mind, he would almost think that there are eleven invisible big magicians around Richard who are casting spells at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last moment, the Black Wing finally seized a gap, maximizing all the vindictiveness, and there was a gray magic shield around the body. This shield is a powerful ability attached to the leather armor of his body, magnifying the defensive power, while weakening the ability to attack the magic to two complete levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a shield, the black wing is still in despair, and the 12 fireball superimposed areas such as the Abyss Purgatory, even if it can reach the end of magic, you can’t avoid it. Seriously injured. This is the horror of the magician, the ability of magic is extremely powerful, almost crushing other professionals in the same class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effect of magic attacks is that there is a time limit, just need to support the past, as a high-level killer, escape hope is still very big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fireball exploded, and the sound of the explosion was submerged by the whistling sound of the subsequent fireball, just like a silent explosion. The black wing looked at the fire and silently expanded and drowned himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain! It hurts! ! This is the first feeling of the Black Wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain caused by these fireballs is much stronger than in the past. Even when the black wing is charged with a magician's fireball, the pain is not half of what it is now. That black wing successfully rushed through the fire, cut the magician into more than a dozen pieces, but now, he just wants to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must escape!" The black wing is almost called out, but the fighting nature that has been formed for many years has made him hold his head and crouch on the ground. It is possible to reduce the area hit by the fire. The fiery heat that has never been experienced seems to lock him in a closed space with only flames, and all the senses are almost completely out of order. Don't say to rush out. When he stands, he almost feels like hanging over the sky. Only after the volcanic land, he feels that the small piece of land under his body is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of fire waves roared past, and the feeling they brought to the black wing was painful and could not be said. In the midst of severe pain and death, his firm will was shaken. The Black Wing and even began to doubt, can Richard add magical effects to each fireball while shooting twelve fireballs in less than three seconds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of damage effects, spell penetration and magical efficiency do have similarities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire waves interact with each other and excite each other, and their ability is greater than that of a single fireball. Although not affected by all the fireballs, when the last wave of fire passed, the black wing swayed and stood up, and the blurred vision could still see the figure of Richard, and when he saw another familiar figure When he sneaked into Richard's quite close distance, he suddenly let out a sigh of relief and fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also shook a few times at the same time, and the feeling of taking time out of the magic is always so sad. However, seeing that the black wing was blown out from the hidden form, and finally fell, Richard finally felt that the depression in the chest dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clark!" Richard screamed again, and the energy of the gods descended from the sky and fell on him. Under the dual effects of constructive vitality and magic, Richard's magic is recovering quickly. The brilliance of the magic is shining again. This time Clark is blessed by the five-level power of the blessing, and has a very strong defense effect on ordinary damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic blessing takes effect, and Richard turns his head and smiles at the killer who has already reached the five-meter category! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer saw that the magical radiance of the sorcerer flashed over, and he had already stayed. He had a wide range of insights and recognized that it was a five-level divine protection. At that time, there was some bitterness in his mouth. On defense and recovery, the effect of magic is far better than the same level of magic. With this magical skill in the body, this 12-level killer is trying to kill Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is known to Richard, but it is close to this distance, how can such a chance be missed? If you can't do it, you will have a few more knives. The magician's fragility is well known. The killer sighed for himself, screamed, and escaped from stealth, as the eagle swooped with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him amazed is that Richard actually took out a long knife behind him and flipped the knife to stab his short sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer has not recovered from the surprise, and Richard’s long knife suddenly came with an unstoppable force, which shocked his short sword and then A knife like electricity, head down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer was horrified, and the sword was held to hold Richard’s full strength, but he couldn’t eat the strong force, fell backwards, and immediately rolled out The pursuit of long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was not eager to pursue, but held a long knife, stopped his footsteps, and raised his left hand in the air, making a gesture. So the brilliance of his magical light flashed again, this time is a five-level magic: war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
