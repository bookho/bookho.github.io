			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the solemn and solemn Ellie, Richard suddenly felt that The eccentricity of this expression, the atmosphere of the expression, and even the place, are incompatible with the nature/love that comes along. If you want to enjoy the process in this situation, you really need a strong heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard always feels that Alice’s performance is very strange, and the next thing may not be so smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to solve Alice’s clothes, and his hands naturally went to the chest, and as a result, Richard’s fingers touched Ellie’s bulging chest, she As soon as the whole body shook, lightning grabbed Richard's hand and prevented him from entering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just do / love, don't need to strip it off, first... first solve the pants." Ellie said slyly, the content is also straightforward, But Richard always has a feeling of watching a frightened rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and explained her belt according to the words. This time it went smoothly, and the belt was pulled out and thrown aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard was ready to fade the trousers down, he suddenly felt Aly婕’s knees move, which was a very small movement. But in the eyes of Richard, it was a very dangerous signal, so the lightning flashed back without thinking, and it flashed a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Alice’s foot is bounced, it’s definitely the fall of Richard’s, and Richard is eating two more eggs of the Hydra And never willing to suffer from this crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing." Richard was a bit stunned and somewhat angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm just not used to it, I don't really kick out, look at your guts." Ellie sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is very skeptical, if Ellie does not have the intention to kick out, he will not directly instinct to escape, he went to Ellie This time, it has increased the alert in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still not going well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie, who had lost her trousers, suddenly changed her mind. Before removing the underwear, she must first remove the light. At this point, Richard has been quite speechless to her, but still wants to cooperate as much as possible. Now in his mind, complete this matter. It's okay, as far as process and fun are concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Ellie looked at Richard’s bodybuilder, raised his head, bit his lower lip, and greeted him with impetuousness, yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh,...do not move,...run what,...do not do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard’s voice grew from amazement to anger, until he finally lost his patience and began to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Ellie’s voice sounded: “Well, it’s okay now, come on, don’t grind it.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it honing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, you don't move, I try to be faster. This is not as terrible as you think. It's very simple. Look, like this... hell. "What are you doing," "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I accidentally used vindictiveness, not intentional, you must be fine, yeah, Richard ... Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a noise in the family cemetery, and there was a faintness in Richard’s voice: "You...you want to kill me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't mean it, come on, continue, don't be like a girl, stand up, I know what you are doing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am strong and can’t stand the sneak attack "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to care about me for such a small thing? Come on, I can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......After a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice." The roar sounded over the volcano. "What do you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"No...nothing, really no, you see, I am ready again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first time you are ready." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time, I forgot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......After a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice, let me talk, what is going on here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah, nothing happened, we are very smooth, aren't you, you see, you don't wear clothes, I don't wear them, there are no other people here, everything is perfect, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't want to be a partner, I am not reluctant, you know, I didn't have this idea at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then why did you accept it later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too good, I don't want to give up on you, and I don't want a third person to get involved in our covenant." Inside, as far as comrades-in-arms and partners are concerned, you are the best choice. I hope that there will be more bonds between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I This is also the case, then don't hesitate, let's continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue, haven't started yet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that Starting ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" that you do not run ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; or after a while ....... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...this is my instinctive reaction, I actually can't control it, So, sorry, you...do more effort, for the first time, I think, there will be no such thing in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I understand, you resist, don't control, use vindictiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, why."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't drain your temper, we can't start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, you are careful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah,,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......After a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tombstones of the forest, Ellie ran, her body was full of burning wildness, and she was particularly glaring in the black and red background, she Full of sweat, gasping, trying to cross an obstacle, but the legs were soft and weakly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came from the rear, the same tired, but the footsteps were steady and powerful, although he was a magician, but when the life tree was upgraded, he realized a large number The rules have made the Elven world tree grow to the second order, and with the resilience of the Hydra lizard, it has a unique advantage in the protracted war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice finally can't run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard almost violently pushed her down, put it right, pressed it, and pressed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful hoaring scream followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally..." Richard grew a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally..." Ellie sighed insignificantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people walked out of the family cemetery, it was already the morning of the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle went through a whole afternoon plus one night, and the process of truly becoming a partner is only ten minutes. The hardship of this battle can be said to have a soul for both people. The baptismal effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi has been waiting in the study room, staying up all night, when she saw Ellie, she immediately greeted her and stared at her for a moment. After that, I said, "You... succeeded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Ellie nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi’s face was gratifying and heart-wrenching. He only sighed for a long time and said, “You... I didn’t expect you to be like this. I’m so sorry... I’m not able to help you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice smiled and patted Faschi’s head and said, “Nothing, I want to do it. The matter will surely succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dissatisfied expression on the side of Richard, if not his resilience is amazing, his physical strength is endless, he has long been She was dragged down, that is, she couldn't make her change to an ordinary sanctuary. Alice, who awakened her real name, really wants to move her hands. The ordinary sanctuary is definitely not her opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after this battle, Richard finally realized that Alice had a natural fear of men and women, but after this success, it should be much better in the future. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, listening to Ellie’s words and sayings, Richard felt very strange, but fortunately he still cares about the face of Ellie, not defaced. she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice seems to think that the cow is blowing a bit too big, and then how her psychological problem Fasqi would be unclear, so she hurriedly took Faschi I launched the study and said, "I have discussed some details with Richard. Don't worry about me, go and help me get something. You know what I like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Faschi, Ellie walked to Richard’s desk and sat down on the table, arms around her chest and looked at Richard, asking: “What are you going to do next? The relationship between them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before speaking this question, I have to remind you first, that is my position."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, it’s very comfortable here, but isn’t it that you are mine?” Ellie’s rogue is also a good hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not pay attention to Alice’s little rogue. For this question, he had already thought about the answer and said: “Forever allies and partners, if You don't give up first, then I won't change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellie snorted and pouted, "If you put your first sentence Get rid of it, then it sounds a lot more, you really can't pick up a girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
