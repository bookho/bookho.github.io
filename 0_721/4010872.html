"Speaking, Blatter handed the magic paper to the legendary mage, who painted more than a dozen different animals on the piece of paper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun took the magic paper and glanced at it casually, his eyes suddenly rounded, staring at one of the humble little creatures, losing his voice: "Shi Nan "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shi Nan, what is that." Blatter looked confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, a little thing." Su Hailun is forced to calm down, but anyone can see that Shi Nan is by no means a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blatt is also a very savvy figure, immediately wiped out all the inappropriate expressions, piled up a smile and said: "That said, you are willing to and me. Let's explore the plane together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Blatter's surprise, the legendary mage swayed his stomach and became addicted, seemingly struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blatt’s eyelid jumped and made up his mind, saying, “If you are willing to agree, then you can get 60% of this harvest, and you can get 60%. You can pick one thing first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition obviously makes the legendary wizard very excited and finally nods. Obviously, her goal is to go to Shiman. During the entire negotiation process, the eyes did not leave the little things similar to the earth elemental creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blat took a breath and smiled: "You can prepare first, and we will start again in three days."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you can go tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blat smiled happily, this kind of good thing, of course, promised to come down Otherwise, Su Hailun has always been known for his own desires, and maybe it will change after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, two faint light flashed over the dark blue, and the two legendary wizards began their journey of exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, at the heart of the horrible plane storm, the old wizard, who was replaced by a gray robe, was sitting on the terrace overlooking Solomon Castle, which had been in existence for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true history of this castle is much longer than that recorded by Noland. In fact, even many scholars do not know that Master Solomon was the discoverer. Not the builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the true support of Solomon Castle in the void is still the oldest circle of law in the depths of the castle, thousands of years have passed Every generation of scholars will be able to challenge this ancient genius, but no one has ever succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the enormous energy storm, the so-called powerful power of mankind is a complete joke, and the ancient wisdom represented by the castle also makes the elders of the generations of scholars The people are amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mage sighed and sighed, continued to read the magic book in front of him, and the open page had an illustration with a similar painting The creature of the elemental elf is labeled Shi Men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mages read the instructions of Shi Nan patiently and meticulously. Every word has not been ignored. In fact, he has read this text no less than ten times. Engraved in the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master looked at the stone man’s pattern and smiled a few times, saying to himself: “Su Hailun, if you are indeed the ancient survivor’s Later generations, then when you see it, you should awaken the relevant memories. Can you resist this temptation? This is your favorite food, and the key to allowing you to evolve again. This is from the depths of ethnic memory. Instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of footsteps on the terrace, and the old master closed the magic book in front of him, coming to a young A magic apprentice, she looks pretty and looks like she is fourteen and five years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took a piece of magic paper and placed it on the table, respectfully saying: "Respected castle master, this is just from the mirror. The message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master picked up the magic paper, read the above message carefully, and after a moment he put down the stationery and said to the girl gently: "You are very good, I can personally copy such important information, indicating that you have gotten the fate of the fate, go to the Rody University, if you can successfully complete the little test he gave you, then you can become his student." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden surprise made the girl unable to be herself. She ate and said, “Be a college student, I understand, I will not let you down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The girl is flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her back, the old mage sighed heavily, feeling: "Destiny"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this moment, the girl suddenly came back again, and said uneasily: "Respected castle master, I just remembered that the Rodi University had left the castle this morning, and he had told me before leaving. It is said that it will be back in a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master’s face suddenly became very wonderful, muttering: "Rody is not there, he is not there. "Fate," <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and raised his hand, and a delicate transmission array emerged on the ground, then gently said: "Since Luo Di is not, then it is the same for me to complete this test for you. At the other end of the transmission matrix, where you need to complete the task, come on, children, be brave, and master your destiny." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was so excited that her cheeks were fainting, nodded hard and strode into the transmission array. Road light in her figure disappear, but in less than ten kilometers from the Castle of the void, the girl's figure appeared there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Solomon Castle in front of her, she immediately widened her eyes and couldn’t believe what she saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the protection of the castle shield, she was immediately destroyed by the incomparably strong radiation in the void, turning into nothingness, and there was no room for screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle master sighed deeply, and the wrinkles on his face seemed to be a few more. He stood up and walked all the way to the conference hall, activated. The magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gems on the back of the seat are lit up, projecting one image into the seat, but this time the thirteen seats are hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some surprises in the illusion, such an important meeting, few people will be absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the old Master said slowly: "Everyone, everyone has arrived, let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A imaginary question asked: "Is there still two people missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old master said: "Rodi University has just set off for an endless whirlpool. I can't attend the meeting, and another, respectable ascetic scholar has decided that I can't attend this meeting, and that's why I called everyone to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;All phantoms are silent, what they feel vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle master said in a slow and heavy voice: "Respected ascetic scholars fall into the despicable trap, Faro’s mother's nest, indeed executed The soul completes the plan, thus gaining an independent and complete soul, but it does not know why it perceives the control that we left in the soul-filling plan, and uses it as a bait, when the ascetic scholar tries to control its soul. In turn, the soul of the ascetic scholar was eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master paused for all listeners to digest this message, and then went on to say: "Respect for the ascetic The scholar gave up the last chance to get out of trouble and used all the remaining soul power to issue a warning. I just received the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it right?" asked a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle master sighed: "It's broken, but not complete. After all, Rodi is not here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an unspeakable silence, the virtual shadows in the conference room were opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul power of the ascetic scholar ranks among the top three among us, even he is degraded, and we are even less likely to be with the Faro's nest in the soul. Confrontation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nest that eliminates the hidden danger of the back door is terrible, not to mention that it still awakens the real name, maybe it won't take long, it will follow the fate of the remnant Traces find us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to find another way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castle generation Start, let the conference hall quiet down, said: "Obviously, the mother nest without soul loopholes, there is no possibility of being controlled again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall and thin The illusion of illusion is said in an indescribable arrogance: "The mother's nest is an extremely dangerous force. Only if it is in our hands is it safe. Such power should not fall into the hands of others, including Richard."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
