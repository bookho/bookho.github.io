			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and reached out to touch the three gods that floated in the air Imprint. When his fingertips touch the imprint, the mysterious power of the eternal and timeless dragons will condense into corresponding gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s fingertips touched the first hourglass formed by the devil’s head, the hourglass suddenly burst and all the golden sand inside rushed into Li Inspect the body, and finally condense into a complex golden god, and then slowly dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly felt a mysterious power in the body, making the body full of vitality. And the meaning of the gods naturally comes to mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God. Life Rapids: In the next fifteen years, your body will no longer senescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gift effect is actually equivalent to life extension for fifteen years. The humans of Noland will generally only gain two life extension effects when entering the sanctuary and entering the legendary realm. In addition, the grace of the Eternal Dragon Temple is the most important way to gain a longer life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to get a longer life is a common desire of all intelligent races, so the time flow rate is recognized as the most precious god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of life needless to say, even for hegemony. In this era of brilliant stars and heroes, many times live longer than their opponents, which is the most direct way to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the first time hourglass got the grace of life, and Richard suppressed the excitement of his heart, and reached out to the second mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hour of the hourglass broke, the golden sand granulated into a stream of light, poured into the body of Richard, and again formed a god. Richard also immediately knew what God gave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God-giving. Calmly: You enter the next sub-planet that does not establish the Eternal Dragon Hall, and the time flow rate will slow down to the time of Noland. One, the duration is thirty years of the plane time. God's effect cannot be effective in the higher order of Noland and Benoland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a godsend that Richard can understand before he thinks about it. With it, when entering the next plane, the relative velocity of the plane will be slowed down. That is to say, Richard has been in the plane for ten years, and it is equivalent to returning to the mainland of Noland. One year. In this world of endless planes, the velocity of the other planes and the Noland time are different, slower and faster, but the time difference is usually within one time. The calm time has slowed down the relative time flow of his entry into the next plane to one-tenth. However, in the secondary plane, it will also consume the life of the body. Staying for 30 years means that the body is thirty years old. Only with the effect of life torrents can the battle in the endless plane be carried on forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the above two gods do not provide immediate combat power, life and time are the greatest gifts that humans can expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard reluctantly suppressed the excitement and joy in his heart and once again reached out to the final ball of light. Richard is very curious about the mysterious gift of time balls, but does not expect too much. Magic mathematics told him that after two good luck twice in a row, the third chance to have good luck... is still half. But even if the time ball can't open any precious gifts, Richard will not be disappointed, because his luck is enough now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the time ball absorbs most of the deity of the demon lord's heart, and it is impossible to say that there is no expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard’s left hand has not touched the time ball, a time stream that wanders randomly in space has accidentally passed the string on his left wrist. The beast tooth, the largest beast that was made into a whistle in the middle, suddenly lit up a layer of light, and suddenly sucked in the time stream! It immediately burned like a burning fire, burning a golden time flame, burning Richard ah! A scream, suddenly stepped back a few big steps, desperately licking his left hand. Fortunately, although the flames of time are fierce, they are extinguished when they blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard took the chain of the animal's teeth, he found that the left hand wrist had been branded with a deep scorch mark, which is like a shape of a tooth. Fortunately, the time flame is different from ordinary burns. Although it was very painful at the moment, the flesh was also hurt by the real, but now the pain disappeared. Richard moved to the left hand. It seems that the function has no effect. He immediately looks at the chain of the beast. Fortunately, the beast chain is intact and there is no trace of damage. Richard couldn't help but sigh. He didn't know why he would value this string of bracelets, perhaps because of the domineering embrace of the mountains and the sea, perhaps what she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After re-involving the chain of the animal's teeth back to the wrist, I was trying to continue the ceremonial cessation. At this moment, an unprecedented pressure suddenly came to the whole. Temple of Time. When the old and desolate breath passed, Richard seemed to glimpse the endless demise of the endless plane in the torrent of time, for a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sense of existence that completely exceeds the limit is filled with the soul of Richard, whose body no longer obeys the command of consciousness and slowly falls over the altar . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People..." is a huge voice that sounds in the consciousness of Richard, but this time it is no longer the feeling of cold machinery, but the ancient The vicissitudes of life and the majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly shuddered and suddenly understood that this is not an automatic reply of the eternal power in the Eternal Dragon Hall, but the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed for a while, communicating directly with the eternal and time dragons above all planes, this feeling is beyond description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, outside the curtain of time, Gordon is looking at a golden hourglass in his palm, his face stunned. These small hourglasses are made of transparent crystal, and the golden sand inside is constantly flowing under the mysterious force, and is not affected by the angle change of the hourglass itself. There are a total of 10 hourglasses in the hour, and they are still filled with the big hands of Gordon. What's important is that they are not just good-looking decorations, but they are made up of the power of the Time Dragon. Whoever breaks them can get God's gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one minute ago, from the curtain of time, suddenly flew out ten time streams, and ten times in front of Gordon, and then fell. The incident came so suddenly that the horrific power of Gordon was unprepared, and almost let the two hourglasses fall to the ground. Fortunately, the Vatican’s great officer next to him waved, and the two were also condensed by the power of golden time. The light belt, carrying the hourglass trap, was sent back to Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Gordon looked at the hourglass in his hand, still unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s great priests swept through the hourglass, and they already know what they are saying, “This is the gift of Eternal and Time Dragon to Archimonde, Time Hourglass The effect is the rapids of life. Archimonde who breaks these hourglasses will get three to five years of extra life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
