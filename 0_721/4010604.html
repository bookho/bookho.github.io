			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Cannan on the stage can see clearly and plainly As he swelled purple, he stared at Richard. If his gaze could kill, he believed that his gaze had penetrated the heart of Richard many times, but Richard did not look at Cannan at all, but turned his head to search. The member of the House of Representatives, when he saw the silver sword count Finril, only revealed a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Silver Sword is a gray-haired old man, who happens to be watching Richard. When he saw Richard’s sneer, Finrill suddenly hit After a chill, I couldn't help but change my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Cannan on the stage has entered the final stage, screaming: "I asked the parliament to award the title of the Duke of Richard, to The Kemond family matched the glory of the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal came out, the parliament hall was surprisingly quiet, all whispers stopped, No amount of light is concentrated on Richard to see how he responds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old and noble aristocrats know what is going on, at least know the meaning of hiding under the water, knowing that this is by no means a good heart of Cannan, but This kind of small conspiracy seems to be of little use. In addition to being able to add some nausea to Archimonde, the conspiracy that is easy to see through is also a conspiracy. Now, see how Richard responded, and the response was not good, Archimonde. Will lose points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked to the podium, seeing that Cannan did not give up the meaning of the podium, so he waved his hand, a muffled sound, an invisible force Just hit Cannan 10 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannan was shocked and angry, cried hysterically: "You used force in the Holy House of Lords, you...you..." Before he even exported, he was forced back to his stomach with a cold eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House and the aristocrats who were attending the incident had a stir, but people’s arguments were not the tyranny of Richard, but the way he just flew Cannan. At that time, Richard was a few meters away from Cannan. He flew out with a handful of Cannan, but the power was not like magic, nor was it just vindictive, but it also had the nature of both. Members and bystanders There is no shortage of strong people, but at the same time they can't tell what kind of ability Richard used to fly Cannan. However, it has been observed that Richard's simple wave-handling action has no aura, and the trajectory is clear and smooth when swiping. This action is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All veterans who have been on the battlefield know that the most terrible thing is that this kind of action is simple and direct, and there are no enemies with no water. This kind of enemy is coming out of the sea of ​​corpse, and there is no need for a second knife to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Richard’s record in the field of extremism was remembered by many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard has already taken to the podium, standing and looking around for a week, saying: "The distinguished members and nobles, I think Baron Cannan is very speaking. It makes sense, I personally agree with his point of view. As a floating island family, I can't honestly say that Archimonde does not have the necessary conditions for a duke title, but this is only temporary, and soon Ake Mond is able to meet the requirements of a Duke, including territories, wealth, planes and knights, so if the noble members of the House of Lords are willing to give Archimonde the honor in advance, I will accept it if The aristocratic court refused to break the grid, it should be, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Richard intentionally paused and waited for the entire House of Lords to be quiet. Raised the voice and said: "No matter what decision the House of Lords aristocracy makes, even if Archimonde does not get the Duke of the Duke, I will complete the obligations of the floating island family as soon as possible, starting with Charles the Great, sacred Alliance of nobles Constantly fighting, winning one piece and one piece of territory from the hands of foreigners, this is also the most noble way for the nobility to obtain territory. Therefore, I declare here that Archimonde will also join the ranks of the sages and open up the territory for the Holy Alliance. Archimonde’s goal will be the vast territory of the west of the alliance; Archimonde’s military front will reach the ocean.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion finally Many sensations were thought of by the lawmakers. Fortunately, this group of madmen in Archimonde pointed the knife to the enemy outside the alliance. It was better than the civil war like the previous times. Gordon was a war madman. The same is true. As for the west of the alliance, what is not important at all, even if it is a fertile land, as long as it can attract Archimonde’s attention, let alone the western part of the Holy Alliance is mostly rolling mountains. All kinds of strange and powerful local sites, this place is not very useful to fight down, it is better not to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the experience of Richard’s rise like a comet shows that he is by no means a fool. Anyone who thinks so does not have a good end to see Mensa, Joseph and Bear Peter knows, so the lawmakers are waiting patiently. They know that Richard must have the following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha floated a charming smile and said in a sweet voice: "But Archimonde’s existing territory is not bordered by the western frontier. The war, my army needs to pass through the territory of several noble aristocrats, the scheduled marching route, will pass through the following aristocratic territory, Viscounts Tren, Baron Ebike, and... Earl of Silver Sword, here again, I am again I would like to express my gratitude to Baron Cannan for reminding me of the glory I have to fight for as a floating island aristocrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire House of Lords was silent, and the Baron Cannan was stunned and speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden scream of extreme anger broke the silence: "I object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes They were all concentrated in the parliamentary seats, where the silver-haired silver sword, Finrill, stood up and pointed at Richard, and he was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The territory of our silver sword does not allow any army to pass." The old and fascinating Earl of Finlier screamed and threw his fist as a force. Support for determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a smile and smiled at Count Fenlier and said, "That said, the silver sword family just didn't want Archimonde to get the duke." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fenlier opened his mouth and bowed and said, "Of course not. I just disagree with your troops passing through my territory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very good reason." Richard smiled and said seriously: "But if I don't pass the territory of the Silver Sword family, how can I get to the western border? Are you going to let my troops fly over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Fenlier blushes and angers: "You can pass from other people's territory." Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the suggestion made by Baron Cannan, I will not pass from your silver sword, and from where." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cannan is Cannan, the silver sword is a silver sword, and he has nothing to do with the family." Earl of Fenlier grew louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Richard gradually closed up and said faintly: "It doesn't matter if the dog and the kennel are related. Who believes?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the protest of Count Finlay, Richard walked down the stage and went straight to him and reached out Pat the Earl's shoulder and said: "Akmund's army has been assembled and the route is certain. Which route my army has to take does not require your consent."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count’s face turned from red to purple, and from purple to white. Before he even protested, Richard suddenly burst into a bright smile and said, “What's more, what are you worried about? My troops are again It won't do anything to you, we just pass by, pass by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count is completely speechless, he looks around for help, but no one responds, several members seem to have some action, but When Richard’s eyes were swept away, he sat back again and said nothing. Now the situation is very obvious. If anyone is in the first place, Richard will target who, the people in the House of Lords know that the debate will never win the opponent. It’s still the military. In the face of Richard’s vague threat of war, there are really few who dare to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenril’s face was gray and hurried away, apparently to rush back to the territory to deal with Richard’s “passing by”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha let the count leave, and no longer go to Cannan, but return to his seat and sit next to the Wellingburg family. The representative turned sideways to Richard and smiled and asked: "Acmemond will not really just pass by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said: "That is Passing by... but only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of the Welling family smiled and stopped asking, saying that this is a nobleman can listen understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the bell in the House of Lords sounded, a team of knights walked into the House, escorting a team of ** officers into the venue, and sitting on the high platform And all the nobles below the baron in the parliament hall were invited out of the hall. In the next trial, only the viscount was qualified to attend, and the decision-making power of conviction was concentrated in the hands of the floating island giants. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, another group of knights escorted Marshal Lundstede to the high platform, sitting opposite the row of officials, the marshal is still legendary The strong, even if convicted, must be polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal Lundstede has been through the battlefield, and once he entered the scene, the meaning of chilling flooded the entire parliament hall, and the temperature dropped a few degrees, all The aristocrats stopped talking and laughing, and looked at the marshal quietly, looking different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is also staring at the marshal, for a long time no see, the marshal is still a soldier like a cast iron, and his own violent violent killing, long investigation and trial Without failing to sharpen his edges and corners, Richard had once fought side by side with the Marshal. His heart naturally understood his terrible power. Although there were legendary strongmen in the parliament hall, they were hidden in the dark town, but Richard did not doubt that the dragon If De Steader really wants to take the plunge, he can kill all the judges in an instant, and even the people in the entire parliament hall can't escape a few. The legend of the town can at least make some use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
