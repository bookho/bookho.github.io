Ress smiled and said, "I want to take down these knights. Unfortunately, my points are not much. I want to change some other things. So I will exchange fifteen sets this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of everyone are a little better, and Reese’s eating is not yet It’s too ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Romney suddenly said with some worries: "They will not give us the shrinking structure?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his good friend, the heavenly Sanctuary Ranger snorted and said: "In this regard, Archimonde's credibility is very good. From the beginning of the points, has opened two Sub-exchange, as long as it is promised, there is never any discount!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that's good! I just have some concerns. This is not It’s late, isn’t it clear?” Romnet smiled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rui Si suddenly sighed and said: "There are these things now, it seems that on the next exchange list, maybe there will be more Big surprise! It seems that my old bones have to stay here for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another legendary mage smiled and said, " The holy structure is out, can there be anything new? It will never be stronger than the fifth-order structure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, he suddenly stayed and squatted on the spot. Richard personally demonstrated the power of the super fifth-order structure, and the heroic hero of the king of angels was deeply imprinted in the hearts of everyone. In case, just say, in case the Midrande battle version also appears on the redemption list? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds incredible, but before getting the redemption list today, who can think of Archimonde’s opening of the fifth-order costume and the wild Knight system suit? Redemption? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those legendary Master thought of things, and everyone else thought of it in a flash, so many powerful hearts began to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn't ask the information of the Medalon battle version, not that they didn't want it. On the contrary, they really wanted it too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most attractive thing about the Medalun combat version is that he can adapt to it, regardless of the warrior and the mage, and can get a great boost. . Richard is a legendary mage, but everyone has seen how he used the brute force to fight the same powerful dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage certainly cannot have this power, and the explanation can only come from the battle version of Midarun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason they dare not ask is because the Medalun battle version is too expensive, and it is expensive to ask for the price. Anyway, I can't afford to ask, what else to ask? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the emergence of points redemption allows them to see a glimmer of light, as long as they can be exchanged with points, then even 10,000 points, 100,000 points As long as you fight every day, it is possible to redeem a set sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if they need to pay for ten, twenty or even thirty or fifty years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary strong will have hundreds of years of life, how many legends have been exploring the depths of the plane for decades, but they are empty-handed and even lost their lives. Not a few. So as long as they have a clear goal, they will have the motivation to fight for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, loneliness, fighting, and even danger, in the face of a fighting heart, all are not problems. As long as they can climb to the top of the standings, nothing is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some people are very pragmatic, such as Iron Shield, he said directly: "I don’t want to be the king of angels, it is not something I can afford. Things. But is there anything else that might be open?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary killer said faintly: "Raytheon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the iron shield, others have begun to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful power and wide adaptability of Raytheon are all seen by the eye. The key is that this weapon has almost no other requirements for the warrior except body and strength. It is quite big. Its value is not in the strong confrontation, but in mass production, and large-scale equipment of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raytheon is just one of them. In fact, even if Archimonde does not open a new exchange in the future, the existing list is enough for them to stay and fight for it. And in the imaginable future, there will be more and more people coming in for the points and joining the ranks of earning points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the dragon's plane is wide enough, and the dragons are much more. In the decades that will be seen in the future, the war with the dragons will not end, then they will have a steady stream of points, and there will be a constant exchange of possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the legendary strongmen left, Richard also took a list from no face and looked at it carefully. After a moment, frowning: "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, a point redemption system. The rules are on the back!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked through the redemption list and saw a description of the points and redemption system later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of this system is actually the distribution of war effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time after the Dragon War, all dragons, whether live or dead, and all the loot on the battlefield are owned by Archimonde, and Each participating strong player will earn points based on his performance in the current battle. Then they use their points to redeem the corresponding things to Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some items are constant, such as 100 points for a standard high-level sacrifice, which calibrates the value of the points and is relatively constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, points and market value are somewhat different. For example, the exchange price of a top-level offering is 500 points, which is much higher than the popular value of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is that Noland’s top offerings are often in a state of pricelessness, and there are often times when someone holds more than a dozen high-level sacrifices, but they don’t change To the situation of a top sacrifice. However, in Archimonde, each issue guarantees a top prize for redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, whether the points system can be promoted, how valuable the points are, depends entirely on the length and depth of the redemption list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this list in his hand, Richard seems to think that he is looking at a list of divine exchanges listed by the old dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of this list is almost the same as the long list of gods that the old dragon used to seduce Richard, but it is not much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five-stage finale, with a wealth of redemption options, from sacrifices to materials to large military supplies. What else can you ask for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this exchange list in hand, Richard knows that just those legendary powerhouses don’t want to run, they can only stay honestly The Dragon Valley fights for itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this kind of news is unstoppable, and soon there will be new strong people coming for the points. It is even conceivable that there will be many strong people who give up the exploration in the depths of the plane and join in the war against the dragon plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before Richard’s legendary powerhouses are more than just the right to explore the Dragon’s plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at that time most of the legendary powerhouses did not listen to the command, zì yóu action, and now Archimonde has a strong structure of the Legion and Druid The Legion, fighting under such a strong auxiliary force, will far outweigh the individual's single-handedness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the points, the strong will obey the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, how do you guarantee the supply on the redemption list? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Richard’s question, there is no face but no worry. She grabbed a redemption list, first hooked a big circle on the dragon material, saying: "These are actually the most demanding parts. However, they all come from the dragon, we only need to do some simple post-processing. On the line, this kind of apprentice apprentice can be completed. The only thing that needs to be done is to expand the size of the material handling field, and it is best to build a few more. In the future, we may need to deal with more than a dozen dragons or even more in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face continues to draw down: "There is no need to say sacrifices. The dragons are full of sacrifices. If they want, they can take them." Then the next step is equipment. On the one hand, we can do it ourselves. Those dragon scales can be made into high quality leather, dragon teeth as weapons, keel medicine, dragon whip... this you want Do you eat it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raid caused Richard to be shocked and said: "I...what do I want to eat?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although through the metal mask, Richard felt that the faceless eyes were shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with carelessness: "You don't have to be crushed into slag every time! This thing works very well, I suggest you try it." Of course, after eating, it will also be crushed into slag, and there is no need to squeeze a drop of juice. But you can at least resist a few times, isn't it? The crackdown is fun, ah hahaha!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw the sweat on his nose and said: "This will be said later, let's talk later! Let's look down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No face to look at Richard, sneer a few times, then use the pen to continue to the list point, said: "We still say equipment. There are a lot of idlers in the dark blue, you can use them all, We have processed this batch of materials into equipment so that there is no one. Of course, we don’t have to pay for the normal employment. You can let Black Gold organize the Masters, especially those young mages, and give them a few more alchemists. Class, as a teaching content, by the way, we will process the materials for us. This will save a lot of money. And the processing speed will be much faster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei listened stunnedly: "This... is this bad?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Anyway, they have to do extracurricular internships, aren't they? We have provided so many materials for them to practice, and it is already very kind to not charge more tuition. "There is no reason to say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that his sweat had come down again, no longer arguing, but continued to listen to her explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last source of equipment is the sacrifice! When you next sacrifice, as long as you see all kinds of equipment, whether it is useful or not, all are exchanged. Come out. We can't use anything, there will always be someone who needs it. The important thing is that the watch grows longer and then thicker. Then... then you don't have to worry about the sacrifice anymore."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! Where do I go to sacrifice? The Holy Alliance is definitely not working, and the Holy Tree Dynasty can’t go..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is the Millennium Empire! Is the chick named Mex not going crazy by you?" No face flushed Richard made a winked expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
