There are no particularly impressive places. In fact, under the command of Richard, any general will appear bleak, that is, capable and unable to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anna obviously stopped Richard’s way, which made him somewhat surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Countess will be very happy to meet you." Anna said blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very helpless, looking up and down Anna, sighing: "I am also very happy to see the countess. But you stopped my way, you think Is this appropriate? Or do you think that you can stop me by force?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna took a step back and took a tribute to Richard, but refused to give way, saying : "I know this is an offense to you. Wait until you have seen the countess. I want to punish me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold faceless beauty face to face It’s OK to say how to punish, but it’s a sigh of relief for Richard. Not being a heart is not a normal man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But compared to seeing the countess, Anna’s temptation is nothing. Richard smiled and said: "The countess wants to see me, I can do it any time. I am not interested in punishing you, let the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Countess will not see you at all. You always have a variety of excuses." Anna did not let it go, and bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already started to move his fingers and sighs at Anna: "You are faithful to the Countess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to know the reasons for loyalty, after you have seen the countess, I can talk to you in detail and in-depth." Anna clearly does not enter the oil, and is ready to desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a pleasantly screaming voice behind Richard: "Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of fragrant winds, Richard turned helplessly and performed a gift with aristocratic etiquette, saying: "The Countess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eka Catalina The count did not speak first, and the voice was sloppy, just like the fox saw the little hen! Finally she laughed enough, and then she said with joy and a deliberately spoiled tone: "Mr. Richard, want to see you." It’s not easy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: “The magic is too bad, I have to work hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You really laugh!" The countess smiled and kept her eyes bent and said: "Is the adult of Richard less than twenty-five this year?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for a long time, the decision is still a bit reserved, so I said a number enough to shock the derailed: "Twenty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ten twenty!" The countess’s eyes sparkled and she looked at her watch. Obviously he did not want to go the direction of the magic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a headache and knew that he was expected to be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle with the Masters Association, Countess Ekaterina did her best to support Richard, not only sending thousands of the most elite troops, but also Two sacred stronghouses were provided. After several battles, the countess’s troops suffered thousands of damages, and after the war, the pension reached hundreds of thousands of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more importantly, Countess Ekaterina is different from Viscount Heim. She is a real power aristocrat. Not only does her strength match the title, but her father, mother and husband have a good name. As a valuable aristocrat in the kingdom, her vivid stance has affected a large number of aristocrats. At the same time, after the defeat of the Masters Association in the first battle, she actively used her influence to lobby around, which indirectly contributed to the disintegration of the Mage Association’s coalition front. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a great ally, from all angles, Richard must be cautious and must be kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countess’s eyes are getting brighter and brighter, staring at Richard’s smile, and almost blurt out the “truthful”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles, his body is still growing because of the effect of life, but his face still retains most of the past. From the time spent, Richard was 18 years old, but his face was still around the age of sixteen. Although the difference is not big, it is also a difference. The short hair that Richard had accumulated was not a small complement to the age of concealing, but it was not as good as he imagined. Under the sharp eyes of the countess who is adept at refining the appearance, Richard's true face is easily seen through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess Ekaterina is around 30 years old, her body is slender and plump, her skin is white and delicate, her face is beautiful, and she has a mature style. It is the woman’s most beautiful age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was really unable to stand her unscrupulous gaze, and asked with a smile: "The Countess, is the Count of Hem?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount is not going to be very good. Richard only heard the satisfaction of the countess, but did not hear the slightest voice of Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countess opened the folding fan with a sigh of relief, and kept swaying on the bare, towering chest, and the two great peaks trembled. Her eyes stared at Richard and smiled. "Little Sim, just fell asleep. The blood of the unicorn is not as powerful as the legend, only three times from the beast to the dead horse! Richard I don't know what precious blood is there on you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sweaty and hurriedly said: "I am just an ordinary person, how can I have that? Fortunately, I have a bloodline? Countess, I am going to discuss some magical ideas with Mr. Sander. What else do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To the name of Sandru, the countess couldn't help but change her face and said, "What's the point of being with the guy who deals with the dead every day? Why not drink a morning tea with me, and then discuss the mystery of the blood and life together?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha maintains a perfect smile and says, "I am sorry, because I am going to leave for a while, so this time is very urgent. Next time I have a chance, I will definitely enjoy your morning tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Li Ms. Xiang Bojue a ceremony, fled like a rush to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Richard’s rapid departure, Anna’s eyes glanced and said, “Mrs, let him run?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How else? What about the use of force? Don't forget that this is his place. Don't look at him as a magician, you can't beat him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimpse of Anna’s face: “I’m not afraid of losing my life, but he is afraid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countess Ekaterina laughed, and reached out and picked a note on Anna's chin, and made Anna's cheeks fly red, saying: "I can't bear it! It doesn't matter, he escaped this time, can't escape the next time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the countess folded her fan and folded her eyes, staring at the direction of Richard’s far away, saying, "Give him medicine next time!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Noland, Richard immediately contacted Niris, and after confirming the sacrifice ceremony the next day, Richard and Niles I met the next time and re-negotiated the details of the plane development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original idea of ​​Richard, it is a partnership system, that is, a model in which both parties invest the same amount of resources and equalize the income of the plane. If the decision-making power is reached, the strategic decision-making parties will discuss it. Due to the particularity of the identity of the Nyris Prince, the management of the plane still belongs to Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to the original input calculation, Richard also includes a stable plane channel. The Schumpeter family invested a lot of divine grace in the Greenson plane, mainly used to strengthen the plane channel. Coupled with Gordon's subsequent investment, it is now only necessary to transfer a person into the Greenson plane, only 3,000 gold coins. The initial investment of Nyris is actually only one sacrifice for tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard still ate a lot of losses, but in the long run, this method is more advantageous because of the clarity of powers and responsibilities. Nires’s magical equipment supply channel for Richard is equally valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is well prepared, detailing how much resources he will invest and the timetable for the investment. As a result, this detailed plan was taken out, not only Nyris, but even Agamemnon’s face changed, and the two were relatively bitter. This made Richard very inexplicable. He felt that he had considered it very well and had taken care of all aspects of his interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold has taught Richard that there is no clear and fair mechanism for the acquisition and distribution of benefits, that is, even the best friends will be separated sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Nyris stood up. He actually had no objection to the model, but disagreed with the proportion of investment and share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one reason, and the amount of resources that Richard plans to invest is really too much, to the level of 10 million! What makes Nyris, who still dreams of millions of dollars a year? How can he get such a large sum of money to invest in the plane war! Moreover, Richard added a sign of evil at the end of the plan, saying that this is only the most basic input, and there is an additional possibility at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris understands that there are many emperors, but there are very few royal constructors. Therefore, as a prince, he must not be more than a royal builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment of Richard’s million is not an exaggeration. In fact, in less than half a year, in less than half a year, Richard has gathered more than One million five million in wealth. Most of them are converted into magic equipment. This shows how fast the expansion of Richard's power in the Faro plane is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the Faro time flow rate is ten times that of Noland, the speed at which Richard gathers wealth resources is too fast. So privately, Nyris and Agamemnon have a strong interest in Richard's ability to build success and blood. However, Richard’s true secret is probably hidden in Farory, that is, his inviolable field, Nyris and Agamemnon are not going to ask, unless Richard tells them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After expressing the objection, Nyris should propose his own amendment, but he hesitated for a long time, but could not say a word. All the money he can get out, not even one tenth of Richard’s, how do you speak? After a stalemate for a while, Agamemnon said that he is willing to invest in the Greenson plane, and he is prepared to combine with Nires to account for a quarter of the proceeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
