			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time the necromancer Sandrug packed up the remaining black warriors. When I came to the city, when he saw the body of Sinclair, he burst into the light and said eagerly: "No! Give her to me. Just give me half a month, I can convert her into a powerful black. Knight! At least fifteen! There is also the body of the lion, hey, no! What is it, it is actually eating the lion lion! It is a powerful undead ride!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru pointed at the mother's nest and cried with great sorrow, completely losing the usual calmness and calmness. In his previous life trajectory, it is not necessarily the time to spend a lifetime of life to encounter such a strong body of fresh corpses, the most important thing is that the soul has not completely dissipated. If you get Sinclair and the lion, then he will immediately climb a new mountain peak of the undead spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lion is the mother's nest," Richard said. Sandro's black warrior is good, but it is only good. For Richard, at least the current undead creatures have a limited role in his overall strategy. In contrast, the mother nest is a more powerful and reliable force. And as time goes by, the horror of the mother's nest will gradually show up. Now, Richard finally understands why Vatican’s great priests say that the hen’s nest is a weapon of the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most special ability of the lion is poisonous. If you can attach the ability to poison the wind, then even if they do not upgrade at all, the real combat power will be greatly improved. In most of the planes, there are few creatures that are not afraid of poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the body of Schenkel’s body? Is she also interested in the power of death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Sandro made a request, the mother's nest immediately sent a strong sense of opposition. The requirements of the sand flow, the mother's nest is very calm, there is no reaction at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly floated an idea: "Is the sand flowing for the mother's nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told his soldiers to take care of the body of Sinclair, and no one would move her. I rushed to the place where the sand was resting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw the sand, Richard immediately asked: "Do you want to give the body of the company to the mother's nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is somewhat difficult to support the body from the bed, saying: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just guessing." Li sighed. Said: "Does this help the mother's nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a powerful person, it will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reluctantly argued: "But this is after all eating people, if the mother nest is used to it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The nest will only listen to your orders." The sand is somewhat meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if Richard can control himself, then the mother's nest can naturally control himself. Richard frowned and suddenly said, "Have it ever eaten humans before?" When it comes to this possibility, it is not up to him to think of the ban he has ever made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the reaction of Richard's behavior on this mother's nest, Liu Sha has confessed, "I let it eat. Strong life, no matter what race, is very helpful to its evolution. If you don't eat Sir Mintel's body, it will not gain the power to strengthen, and will not use the power to strengthen the emergence of the fast beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard deeply glanced at the girl who had the closest relationship with herself, only to think that her fans seemed to be more and more. But the intention of running sand, he is already very clear. She did not want Richard to bear too much guilt, and she came forward and made many decisions that made it difficult for Richard to make a decision, but it was beneficial to the whole team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand left the light to Richard, but he stood in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like to do these things?" Richard thought for a moment, looked up at the sand and his eyes were clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand was silent for a moment, shook his head and said, "I don't like it, but someone must do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you don't like it, don't do it." Richard smiled and smacked the chin of the sand, kissed her on the lips, and said, "I will come later!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Richard went outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But....... No! You can't do this! And I'm used to it!" The quicksand, jumped directly from the bed and wanted to pull it. Richard, but she is extremely weak, and her bed is soft and almost falls to the ground. When Richard turned back and reached for a hand, he took the drifting sand in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sands eyes solemnly and said, "Sand sand, since these things must be done, then there is always a need for someone to do it. Since it is In this way, instead of being you, it would be better for me. I don't want you to have these little hands and get too much of these dirty and dark things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard grabbed the hand of the sand and gently printed it on the lips, then slid her up, put it back on the bed, and covered her with a quilt. The stream sands sent his figure to disappear behind the door, his eyes widened, but his face had no expression on his face, and he could not see joy or sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard came to the city again. The body of Sinclair is still in the same place. Gangde personally guarded with more than a dozen soldiers and waited for Richard to return. It’s not someone else who is confronted with Gangde, but Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undead Master is obviously extremely attached to the first black knight in his life, and the more he observes the body of Sinclair, the more he feels he can summon an unprecedentedly powerful The black knight came out and there might even be a black knight warlord. If the god of death cares, this warlord may continue to advance, and even have his own independent wisdom and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the lion, it has entered the belly of the mother's nest. The nest is quiet, its head is in this direction, but no one knows if it is concerned about Sinclair. Only Sander, who is very sensitive to the spirit and soul, can feel a huge mental power sweeping from the body of Sinclair. Sandru, who had a battle with the Brood, knew that it was the spiritual fluctuation of the Brood. It was only during the Battle of Death Marsh that the mother's nest was still very weak, and even almost let Shandru force slavery control. However, it is only a few months now, and the spiritual strength of the mother's nest is almost the same as that of Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly came to the nest and said, "This is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
