Can be cut by deified weapons, you are also dead It’s worth it!” Luo Fu stepped forward in a step of lightning, and the huge lightsaber went straight to the heart of the strong man. This great sword with the power of terror was brought up, but the speed was not slower than that of Luofu's original sword. For a time, Luofu’s hands were in the hands of Shenghui, and the giant swords in his hands rushed to the strong man like a squally shower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall, a group of soldiers are heading for the city defense giants, and a few of them are specially trained to be guarded by two 12-level warriors. With. Their actions are not unpleasant, and the soldiers in the camp have just assembled into teams. These groups of city defenses have already rushed to the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just next to the sprinting people, suddenly there was a faint figure. Then the black gas flashed, and a 12-level warrior suddenly flashed his face, and then his head left the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, the bowstring sound is constantly ringing, and a magical arrow flies out. Every time an arrow is thrown, a soldier will fall. In the close range, the power of the refined magic handcuffs that Richard brought back is that the strong people of the sanctuary can't resist it. What's more, these are just ordinary players with strong physical strength but no strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an empty handcuff, and the twilight emerged from the darkness as a ghost, and then began to fill the swords of the fallen soldiers one by one. Only by annihilating the heart, the scorpion can absorb the soul energy and the essence of life, and it is not possible to use the arrow to shoot. Therefore, the soldiers she shot, will not die for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the twilight is busy filling the knife, the splashes of the two 12-level warriors have been dissolved into the night, and a faint shadow rushes to the guard. The warrior of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, an incomparably burly figure floated out of the city wall and landed next to the giant python. The light is the shock that he produced when he landed, and the soldiers who guarded the city’s flood control were swaying. This is a giant of up to three meters. He suddenly squats, and his whole body is full of arrogance. With a giant arm, he will sweep seven or eight soldiers out of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tami, the 16th-level giant mad warrior, is also the sacred powerhouse sent by the Earl of Crow to protect Him. Tonight's attack camp was borrowed by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water blossoms out like a wind, and all the dead and wounded soldiers are quickly killed. Then somehow dragged a magical giant arrow with a burst effect. However, Tami took the opportunity of the city's anti-theft giants, madly provoked vindictiveness, and the city defense shackles that required dozens of people to be swayed were actually slowly pulled by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card slammed, and the water spray broke out once again, filling the giant arrow into the machine, and then began to adjust the direction and height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Tami stepped down and took a four-meter burst of lightning and flew out, stalking a bright red trail in the night sky. Eventually it fell on the edge of another city defense giant, a loud noise, the fireball formed by the violent magical energy instantly wrapped the giant python and the surrounding defense fighters, and at the same time, all the smashers who were trying to start the giant python were blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water spray immediately dragged a burst of cockroaches, and Tammy snarled again to pull the machine away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A branch bursts bright red, and a fireball with a coverage of 20 meters is blown up on the wall. The power of a bursting cockroach is much greater than that of a normal fireball, and only a seven-level bursting fireball can be compared. Tami and the water flower cooperated, and the other two city defenses were bombarded. But after the seven-shot shot, Tami was sweating and squatting, and sat down on the ground, exhausting his vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, the negative magic of Sandru and Yan Mei interfered with one of the control squads of the city defense squad, but another city squadron successfully launched a burst of cockroaches, consuming Richard's book of bearing. The reserve magic, six violent bears turned into cannon fodder. But this is the first time that Richard has been able to accurately control the violent bear's landing point, and it is still in the mid-air position. Those rough and thick magic summons detonate the giant python in advance, reducing their own casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest threat to Blue Castle has been lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is sitting in the war and seeing a team of giant shields and axe-shaped warriors coming out of the darkness, taking a uniform step and striding Enter the Blue Party camp. A total of six hundred humanoid warriors stepped on the ground at the same time, letting the earth tremble, and every step fell. The roaring sound was like a low drum, making people feel shuddering from the bottom of their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanoid warrior is a throwing soldier protected by a hundred humanoid warriors. In the center of the throwing soldiers, it is the pastor and mages of Richard. Of course, priests such as Iowa and quicksand are acting alone. They strategically cooperate with the commander, and the specific placement has the greatest autonomy. The same is true for the strong people above the Sanctuary and the Magisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first garrison rushed out from the center of the camp and ran into Richard’s humanoid heavy warrior! These soldiers who were born for killing did not say a word, no war, no roaring, just silently repeating the mechanical movements, smashing the front of the shield, swinging the axe, then Shield, and then throwing the axe. Every row of battle axes fell, it was all blood and splashes, screaming! In this way, the battlefield composed of humanoid heavy fighters built a fleshy passage in the enemies that swarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front row of humanoid warriors shine with the brilliance of magic and magic, on the contrary, the blue army camp's defenders are riddled with negative state. Just a wide range of delays is enough to make these fighters fall into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic crushing, magical crushing, level crushing, and even the warrior's equipment is also crushed, and finally this group of humanoid warriors with the impact of countless enemies, At the same pace, from the south gate of the camp to the north gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the humanoid warrior, the squad’s sand cavalry and barbarian warriors followed, and at this time the viscount’s large forces entered the battlefield on time, along the way The passage of flesh and blood flows into the bluestone camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the lords of the Dukes of the Wolfs began to enter the Bluestone camp. At this point, the number of Richards troops who have entered the camp has reached more than 5,000, and the number of the garrison troops has also been overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Gate is far away, the morale of the Bluestone Camp has finally collapsed and began to flee. Some of the soldiers who guarded the North Gate did not even have time to open the gates that blocked the obstacles. Instead, they climbed directly onto the wall and jumped off the wall to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the entire camp is burning with war, but there is only one battle left in the important battle, that is, the Sanctuary strongman Luofu and holding The showdown of the guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-layered warfare scroll of Luofu has passed, and at this moment it relies entirely on its own combat power and the other side. The guns and strong men are still strong, but there are several serious injuries on their bodies. The vindictiveness is even more consuming. They are all blessed with war and sorcerer, and Luo Fu is injured when holding the weapon of deification. Even so, when Richard arrived, the gunman was still roaring, killing Luofu wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gun and a strong man, he saw Richard. When he fights with Luofu, he still pays attention to the battlefield of the camp. He has already discovered that Richard is the enemy commander. I immediately thought that I would stab the young great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't expect Richard to see through his mind. He turned over and slid down. He walked back ten meters like a water, opened the distance, and stood like that, watching him calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the retreat of Lee makes the guns and brawny shrink! This is completely different from the teleportation of the legal person he has seen, but no matter what it is, in his current state, it is not an easy task to want to stab Richard. It is better to kill Luofu in front of him. As long as you add more strength, this Juggernaut with no fighting power and a weak bird can be pierced by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a heavy armor appeared in the side of Richard, he jumped a few hops with a gun and a strong man, completely giving up the plan to kill Richard. Then there is Tiramisu, Clark, Io, Sandru, and the faint waters in the dark and the hues that are completely integrated with the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a magical glory fell on Luofu, let him cover his wounds. The cleverness of this healing opportunity almost made the eyes of the gun-bearing people stand out. Then, many of the priests and magicians worked together, and Luofu’s body was immediately entwined, and I did not know how much gain effect. The black and dark green light flashed on the body of the gun, and it was a bunch of negative effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha finally said: "Surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gun and a long laugh, Loudly said: "Richard! Do you see Grandpa like this, will you surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sighed and said: "Then Ok, just send you on the road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his left hand and ten free Archimonde fighters emerged from the dark, each in their hands Holding a magic trick! In the hands of Richard, the fate of the twins waved, and a flash of lightning fell from the sky, slamming on the gun-bearing man! The strong current generated by the seven levels of magic makes this powerful who surpassed the ordinary sanctuary also shocked, and the action suddenly became a stiff! It is this small flaw that has been captured by the free Archimondes who have a lot of combat experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night sky, the arrow flies, and in a moment the strong man has inserted seven or eight arrows, and the roots have no handle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man screamed and screamed, and the gun slammed for a week, pushing all the enemies around him back a few steps. Zhang looked around for a week, then laughed three times and his head finally hangs down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of his death, he still stands still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventeenth-level sanctuary, Tiida Fenton, died in the Blue Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood silently, and asked Clark, who was very familiar with the situation on the mainland, for a moment: "Who is this person?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark said: "It should be the younger brother of Tiida, Earl of Lambert. But he has his own business. We have not gotten news of his entry into the bloody place before. I don't know why. It will appear here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are more and more strong people we have provoked, I don't know if it is a good thing or a bad thing." Richard said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand does not know what to think of, sighs and sighs, saying: "This is the only way for every strong."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and looked at the blue camp where the war was burning and killing the sound, and said: "Tonight we won, and Tida became my step." Stone. When I am defeated, will it become a stepping stone for others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
