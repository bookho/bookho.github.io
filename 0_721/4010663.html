			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dawn, the ice floes are clear and transparent, cloudless, high On the wide sky, there are several traces of different shades of purple across the sky, which is the bursting of time and space that has not yet completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue after the robbery is full of busy people, the warehouse in the annex building community has been opened, the bulk of the stored stone materials are shipped out, and then moved to At the specified location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue outer layer, a layer of scaffolding for construction climbing is being built, and numerous mage are moving back and forth on the construction site, they can use anti-gravity Huge components are transported to higher places, and the power of magic can be used to soften the stone and facilitate cutting. Other wizards take the design and carefully search for and repair the weak links that may occur due to breakage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since His Highness Su Hailun has awakened and his strength is intact, Deep Blue has resumed the order of efficient operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top layer is the most serious place in the entire dark blue, which is almost half collapsed, with the lower layer followed by the shackles, under the top floor, a full three-story area They are all private areas of Su Helun. It is extremely luxurious here, and it is more of a kind of hard work of the legendary mage for nearly a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a little girl who wants to have a dream world. In a long time, she used a piece of building blocks to build the most beautiful world in her heart. Helen’s artistic talents will only be revealed in things related to the stars. Even the most imaginative art masters will admire a miracle. Besides, her aesthetics can only be described as weird. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the deep blue, groups of wizards are working hard, they put a block of black rock in the designated position, and then carefully fill in the gap just cut The star blue stone, then melt the azure amber with magic, and cast the juice in the gap, so that the black rock and the star blue stone are integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from the sky, this is the corner of a very large and complex magical array. Such a huge and so complicated magic array requires extremely amazing calculations during design. It is almost impossible for humans to design. Fortunately, in order to serve the public, the Deep Blue Library is located in the lower blue, and has not been affected by the war. The magic map has been preserved intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of giant magic arrays in Norland that are bigger and more powerful, but most of them are made into separate functional modules, which are then spliced ​​into a whole, and the magic of the top of the dark blue Array, but no functional modules, but directly built into a whole, this magic array is designed by Su Helen personally, in the entire dark blue, and only she has the ability to design such a large scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this huge magical array is to resist the spatial fluctuations that may occur around the dark blue, while providing positioning for Su Helun, who explores deep in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Rock and Sapphire are not too expensive, but they are never cheap, but the amount of top-level repair is too large, just a material fee. More than 10 million gold coins, a large number of Master's labor costs, is a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, after the establishment of the deep blue and several expansions, Black Gold has hoarded a lot of building materials for the foresight, when the legendary mage wants to cover a small When the toy is used, there is no patience to wait for the stone to be purchased from the market. Therefore, the immediate repair work can be carried out immediately without being restricted by the supply of the market goods. Otherwise, the temporary large-scale purchase will lead to the price difference of the raw materials, which may lead to His Highness Su Hailun. The small face of the haze is a bit darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first meeting after Su Hailun’s wake-up was placed in the conference room where the big magisters met daily. Of course, there is no Su Hailun’s fantasy hall. The momentum, just in the last illusory invasion, the Emerald Dream was completely destroyed. It takes a few months to rebuild. It will have enough raw materials on the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage puts on the sky blue robe, the small face is serious, sitting on the main seat, the big magisters are on both sides, leaving Su Hailun's recent differences are Black Gold and Phil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they should be present at the 17th Magister Mentor, but only 11 of them were present at the moment, and three great Magisters died in the illusion of last night’s war. The other three great magisters were seriously injured and were unable to attend this meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold and Phil’s injury is not light, the gray dwarf has a metal neck support at the back of the neck, and the imaginary blow interrupts the gray dwarf The neck bone, but this kind of injury is not fatal if it is treated in time, and it will not leave any disability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big magisters have two minor injuries, but the rest are unharmed. It’s not because the combat skills are outstanding, but Because they held a neutral stance in the battle and did not join the battle of last night, this is also a privilege of the Dark Blue Magisters. During the war, they can choose whether to participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing discussed in the meeting was not the reconstruction of the deep blue, but the subsidy of the deceased and the subsidy of the wounded. The gray dwarf dragged the body of the wounded, stayed up all night, and put the list and plan in place. In the face of Su Hailun, the final result is a number that makes Black Gold somewhat breathless, 17 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun glanced at the number of the pension and asked: "How much cash is in the dark blue vault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The gray dwarf immediately replied: "Three million, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the minimum need to maintain the deep blue operation, so Su Hailun from the hand A small pocket popped up in the space ring and was thrown to the gray dwarf. He said, "There are two spider crystals, all for the pension, and the extra part pays for the reconstruction of the dark blue. As for the gap... I think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage has a large amount of private possession, which can support the famous Midsummer Carnival auctions on the mainland, but this high-value treasure is not easy to pass through daily sales channels. In a hurry to get rid of the hand, and the equivalent of gold coins, in addition to rebuilding the Magic Array will consume a lot of magic crystal, there are two Bethela spider crystals left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pension and reconstruction, the atmosphere in the conference room was a bit more relaxed. At this time, Phil suddenly asked: "His Royal Highness, you have to enter Faust "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun's small face swept through a layer of murderousness, which lowered the temperature of the entire conference hall by several degrees. After biting his teeth, it was only a little calm after a while, saying: "Forget it, a small matter, there is no need to destroy this and the agreement of the Holy League."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Su Helun established the deep blue, he was paid attention to by the emperor of the Holy Alliance. At that time, the Holy Alliance gave her a lot of material and military assistance, and the vast areas around the ice floes were classified as deep blue, and the conditions for exchange. It is Su Hailun who is responsible for blocking the southward route of the polar continent on this side. In addition, Su Hailun himself is not allowed to enter the floating world. The latter agreement is actually afraid that after the growth of Su Hailun will be strong, he will interfere with the inner chamber of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Su Helun is indefinitely taking advantage of it, but thinking deeper, this is not a big deal, there is still room for no fixed action. Otherwise, it is entirely possible to slaughter Richard and run again. Of course, the turbidity will not be able to save his life, but the legendary master weighed the value of his big master student and legendary attendant, or decided to abide by the old time. Contract to maintain its reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing Su Hailun’s answer, Phil nodded and said, “Then I will not move.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magisters present were serious, Without a smile, they all heard the declaration of Zhang Yang when they left nowhere last night, but they even saw the magical power of Su Hailun’s ruin, even if they had followed the legendary Master’s face war. Cold sweat, no one wants to provoke the anger of the legendary mage for no reason. In case a space bursts and throws over, the spread is in kilometers, but it is a wide-ranging attack without any difference, they can't escape even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they also heard the rumors of the legendary Master and Richard, although they felt that this is unlikely to be true, but in an unidentified identity and her character It seems that there is no need to lie. Is it true that what happened between the legendary Master and Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human heart is a wonderful thing. When it starts to tilt in a certain direction, it will always find a lot of clues, constantly supporting their conjecture, such as The legendary mage suddenly fell asleep, such as Richard and the inexplicable battle of life and death, and then, for example, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, as long as you think carefully, the evidence seems to be more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are big mages, sometimes they can’t control the cranky thoughts in their hearts. The only thing they can do is not to let these ideas emerge from their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun wanted to ask about Richard’s injury. When he came to the mouth, he suddenly felt inexplicably feeling unnatural and swallowed back. She signaled the end of the meeting. I left the conference hall and walked to the magic laboratory alone. In this area, the best laboratories have been vacated for use as a treatment and recovery of important people in one of the most well-equipped laboratories. At the time of treatment, it was Taichu and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole lab is full of blue and shining light, full of magical energy everywhere, on one side of the wall, leaning against two huge leaves The container is filled with half full of clear liquid. Richard and the lie in the beginning, the half body is soaked in the water, is falling asleep deeply, surrounded by a complex magical array, an elderly elf The mage is busy, while recording the data of the magic array, while paying attention to the loss of the magic crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun entered the lab, his eyes swept over the beginning of the day and Richard, only a little stay in Richard for a while, the old mage was very busy Did not notice the arrival of the legendary mage, is unplugging a group of magic crystals that have run out of energy, and then insert new magic crystal into the magic array to maintain the operation of the entire magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
