			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zonghu on the side said somewhat lazily: "It’s nothing to rush out. Just let us set fire to besieged, and we have a big loss in our current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am worried that they will not come out." Three-pointed and dissatisfied, he snorted a few times and said, "Then we don't want to wait all day, what kind of cockroaches can't be harvested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He smiled and said: "If you are three-pointed, you may be disappointed. Most of them will not come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the altar hall, the shadow is summoned The portal slowly closed, and countless shadow warriors stayed at the door, trying to stop the door from closing, but the giant door was still closed with an unstoppable momentum, only listening to a loud noise, and hundreds of shadow fighters caught in the middle of the gate exploded. Open, more than ten shadow diamonds fall like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing of the portal reveals the power of space rules. It is not something that conventional forces can compete with. When the doors are closed, the inside and outside doors are equivalent to two. The connected space slowly separates and returns to their respective tracks, and how powerful creatures can survive in such a state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In outer space, the shadow creatures are in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the inexplicable disappearance of the beacon beacon, the shadow creatures in this space have lost their goals. Over time, many have left the airspace, only The Shadow Corps assembled here is still waiting quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not long ago, a portal suddenly appeared in the center of the shadow community of the recreation. When the portal was opened, it actually produced a great suction force. Under the circumstance, a large number of unprepared shadow creatures were sucked into the portal and then ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow creatures experienced the initial chaos and realized that the other end of the portal was the main material world, and immediately swarmed in, but did not expect the portal to last only After a few minutes, it began to forcefully shut down, and many shadow creatures gathered around the portal, anxiously spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the portal didn’t disappear. After the close, it stood quietly in the air, and the surface flashed a touch of pale gold from time to time. Feeling inexplicable fear, do not dare to force the door, and the shadow creatures are not without wisdom, they are afraid of destroying the portal, and once again broke the road into the main world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the Shadow Corps began to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the altar of the altar, Rios grabbed the neck of a shadowed serpent with a layer of green gas on the big hand, half of the shadow serpent The body immediately faintly rusted and turned into a solid body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of shadow creatures is greatly reduced after the materialization, and Rios pulls the snake into two pieces and throws it on the ground, on the ground. There have been a lot of shadow creatures, they are like a statue of steel, but they are distorted and strange. These are powerful shadow creatures. Rios first turned them into steel entities, and then Easy to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the environment of the Cold Iron Throne, which has a huge cold iron vein, Rios can fight like this, and Hill has no such conditions. He floated in the air, dozens of silver wire entwined with the last huge shadow creature, smashed it with force, smashed it, and the shadow biofilm dissipated, but Hill's silver silk dimmed a little. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill gasping, looking around, never seeing the shadow creature again, this is a sigh of relief, he glanced at Rios , helplessly smiled a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary powerhouses are all bruised and bruised. The most visceral parts of the wound can be seen inside, but the physical injury is not fatal. Both Hill and Rios consume a lot of energy. At this moment, the remaining fighting energy of Oss is only one-third, and Hill is even as low as one-tenth of the extremely dangerous level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally killing, I didn’t expect that guy to summon so many shadow creatures.” Hill said with a wry smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rios coughed a few times and looked at the two steel shackles around him. He sighed and said, "This guy is not simple, early. Just prepare this hand to deal with us, you find no, these shadow creatures can't get out of this hall, can only besiege us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill one Hey, looking at the surrounding cave wall, his face immediately became very ugly. The walls of the hall were black and bright. I don’t know what the material was made. This kind of material didn’t even know Hill. It was obviously not the material of the original altar. When they first fell, they were separated from the senses by the space barrier. After the battle began, Hill was under more pressure and was indifferent to pay attention to the surroundings. At this time, it was discovered by Rios that he was abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for a finger, and a silver wire immediately cut a large piece of the wall and rolled it into the front of the eye. This is very clear. This dark substance penetrates into the hole wall and goes deep into the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before further research by Hill, Rios suddenly vacated and said: "Be careful, that portal is still there."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill was shocked and looked up, and saw that the strange, quaint portal was slowly emerging from the sky, and the magical symbols were lit up from time to time on the giant door. The frequency is getting faster and faster, and the giant door has signs of opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rios lightningly rushed to the portal, and he knew that if he let the portal open again, neither he nor Hill would have a very good result. wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Rios rushed halfway, but suddenly stopped and turned to look at the passageway of the cave wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when it’s in the mouth of the passage, holding a blue flame in his hand, staring at Rios, this little The blue fire made Rios feel the danger of being abnormal. He even refused to open the door of the shadow that was about to open, but stared at the flame in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rios always felt that the flame was very familiar, but I couldn’t remember where I saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hill trembles and says: "You can control the flame of the Star of Destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time that Richard has heard the term "Destruction Star", but the blue fire is indeed the monthly force of the blue moon. In Noland, the seven-string moon is also time-dependent. Alternating in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard has come to a default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rios turned and wanted to smack to Richard, but hesitated a bit, and of course he could see that the only apparent exit channel in the entire altar space, Certainly arranging a large number of ambushes of loneliness, Richard dared to show up at this time, naturally not unprepared, and Rios is extremely jealous of the flame in the hands of Richard, in the narrow passage, almost unable to escape, can only be hard anti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the moment of hesitation, Richard has launched the portal of the shadow summons, the giant door just opened a gap, a dangerous feeling of chilling and cold Just pouring down the head, let Richard suddenly chilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard took the initiative and immediately closed the shadow summoning portal. Then he shot the blue fire in his hand to the portal. At the same time, he turned and flew at full speed, and did not go to see the results in the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear felt an incomparable danger at the side of the gate, and the closer Rios and Hill were almost manipulated by a huge sense of danger. They involuntarily stiffened, and then saw countless shadow spears from the gap in the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear is like the rain, every power is not bad, but this is all, and Hill suddenly remembered a terror legend, exclaimed: "Shadow Legion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Corps is very different from ordinary shadow creatures. They are in groups, have primary wisdom, and are no longer the ones that rely on instinct. Low-level shadow creatures, and even more terrifying, the existence of the Shadow Legion means that there will be at least one general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow generals can be different from ordinary shadow life, they are extremely intelligent, cruel and deceitful, and the individual strength is extremely tyrannical, the shadow life has no physical characteristics, let Most weapon attacks are ineffective against the shadow generals, an extremely difficult enemy and one of the most unwilling creatures to explore the space of the legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of shadow spears has hundreds of rains, forcing Hill and Rios to retreat to defense, and then from the gap in the giant door There are a lot of shadow creatures in the blowout, and this time all are powerful shadow warriors, not the last shadow creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal has been slowly and painfully closed, just as there was a very angry roar from the other side of the portal, a giant claw suddenly Probing from the portal, forcing the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every second of the portal, hundreds of shadow creatures rush into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original portal close is the use of the regular power of space, but the owner of this giant claw obviously has extremely terrible power, and can forcibly compete with the space rules. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s blue fire has already flown at this point and slammed directly on the portal. The blue flame immediately splashed around and the whole seat was about to be transmitted. The door is lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
