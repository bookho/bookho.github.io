			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, return to the base of the sand and check the physical condition of the prisoner again After that, I will see Richard at the agreed time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room of Richard is in a small building in a north-only courtyard. This is the place where the former captain lived. The courtyard is quiet and the room is spacious and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sand came into Richard’s bedroom, he saw dozens of magic materials on the table, sorted out, neatly, and fully demonstrated a builder. Precision and rigor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li asked the sand to sit on the bed and said: "This time the decoration is a magic increase, I made some minor modifications to it, according to the hand Some materials, the final increase should be more than 20%, but because of the lack of three important materials, the increase is less than 30% of the theoretical maximum, even 25% of the standard extreme is difficult to achieve."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"20% is already very good, I can have another four-level powerful treatment." Liu Sha smiled and said, "Where is it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right arm may have some pain. Take off your clothes first." Richard lowered his head and concentrated on preparing the magic material, not looking at the process of unloading the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked up, he couldn’t help but hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand actually took off his clothes and left only the bottoms, and the beautiful upper body was all exposed in front of Richard. She is slightly thinner, but the chest is much fuller than her body. Although not as spectacular as the 黛美 and Venica, the arc of the upturn is perfect. The strange thing is that her ** is not pink, but the same amber color as the eyebrows and eyelids. It is faint and transparent, and there are crafts that are exquisitely crafted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to take off so much." Richard's voice was so small that he couldn't hear clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not much, so you can see it clearly." Flowing sand said faintly. Her words are the truth, although the structure is painted on the right upper arm, but in order to sort out the magic direction, she also needs to at least take off to reveal the entire right upper body. There is not much difference between revealing half a chest and revealing the whole chest, but this sentence is heard in Richard's ear, but it always feels very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard has some embarrassment, Liu Sha added: "Everything is for survival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard took the magic pen and calmed down and said, "Okay, then I will start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pen tip that draws the magic pattern is actually one The extremely thin and hollow needles, all kinds of made materials slide down the pinholes, which is a line with a specific magical attribute. Therefore, the magic pens that can make the magic pattern are all top-level alchemy products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee held the arm of the drifting sand with his left hand, holding the magic pen on his right, calming down and gently slid down her arm. Richard's breathing slowly became gentle, the magic pen was also unusually stable, and the tip of the pen was gently placed on the smoothed skin, and a very shallow and fine nick was drawn. The magic dye was revealed from the tip of the pen. Come, it is a very fine line, even if there is a natural curve interference of the human arm, the arc of this line is also accurate to an incredible point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the replacement of a magic pen, a complex and beautiful magic array has revealed a small half. Richard's forehead has oozing fine sweat, but his eyes are still focused, his breath is long and steady, and people can listen to it in his ears, and he will feel peaceful and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand in the idle sand is holding the interrogation materials that Richard has sorted out, and he is watching it seriously. The data is mainly divided into two parts, a political structure, customs and customs of the White Rock Principality, as well as some important big names. The other part is the map of the Baron of Fossa and the surrounding area. This map is much more detailed than the original one. All the big towns are marked, including the town of Osfa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand quickly read all the information, so I have been quietly watching Richard. And Richard has not noticed that her gaze is on her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely complicated line of sight is coming to an end. This is one of the most critical lines in this magical array, and the longest one. The root line has been hovering to the inside of the arm of the drifting sand. At the last moment of the collection, suddenly a pale amber crystal leaps into Richard's field of vision. Richard's breathing immediately became a bit heavy, and the power that was originally controlled by the hand was fluctuating. The magic pen tip sank and stabbed a blood spot on the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Richard was a little annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a small mistake, the finished construction will be reduced by 0.5%. And he rarely makes similar mistakes, but how can this error be explained? It can be said that the chest of the sand has a fantasy-like beauty, so when he saw the mind, did he lead to the loss of control? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw that the sand was watching himself. Her eyes were like gems, with a faint smile, laughing like everything. All right in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for what Richard said, the quicksand uses her unique, faint and hoarse voice of the sand of time, faintly said: "I believe that if it is another builder, even a big builder, I have certainly made more than three or five mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chardon felt a lot easier, and he was very angry. Then I wanted to explain that this was the first time I painted the figure on someone else. I didn’t expect the sand to say: "...but you made this. Wrong, it shouldn't be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore all the explanations were blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Liusha added another sentence: "In fact, if you want to see it, you can watch it at will. If you want to touch it, it is ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these words have a critical hit, then her last sentence is lore: "Also available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I.......that, not that...." Richard suddenly felt as if the wisdom of talent had left him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sands floating on the smile, said: "It doesn't matter what it means. Anyway, I will see it later, I will touch it. I have seen more touches. I won't be in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he had nothing to say, simply stopped explaining and continued to work hard. However, before this move, he simply stared at the sand of the flowing sand and looked at it. This began to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really effective, until the completion of the predetermined one-third of the structure, Richard never made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the last stroke, Richard looked up and his eyes naturally fell on the sand of the sand. He praised: "It's really beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
