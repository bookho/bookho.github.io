			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer never dreamed that he would be slashed by a magician one day. Chase. But now he doesn't feel that this thing is funny, just fleeing desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not good at speed and dodge, he’s been cut into two pieces by Richard. The faint long knife in the hands of Richard was too sharp. After a few blows, his short sword broke into two pieces. And when he swung his sword, he even had a faint sword, and several times he brushed his hair and took a piece of hair. The killer has no doubt that if he is brought to this point by a knife, he will immediately have more than one part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer has only half of the short sword, and it is better than nothing in the block. Fortunately, there is a spare dagger on the killer, otherwise it can only be blocked by empty hands. Counterattack is even more reluctant. Richard has a lot of accomplishments in the dark world. If you don’t see the miraculous 12 fireballs, the killer will almost think he is being chased by a senior colleague. ! He used all his skills and couldn't pull a little distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chau is like a wind, all the way to chase the killer. With two high-level magical techniques and a long knife from Sinclair, the killer was almost completely abused in all aspects, and he did not fight back. What the killer can do is only how far it is to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has deliberately slowed down the rhythm and used the little magic of recovery to instantly illuminate one by one. Zero-level illumination consumes almost nothing, but serves to provide a light source. The problem is that these lightings are accurately placed on the killers in stealth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killers suddenly found themselves with a magical light source on their heads, and the sneak attack has long been a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the killers were out of stealth, Richard stopped and watched the killer who had been chased by himself and quickly opened his own distance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer suddenly got out of danger and was almost excited to cry out. At thirty meters away, he dared to look back and saw that Richard stood in the same place, only smiled meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer is a glimpse first, then suddenly understand what, can not help but scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually opened a distance with a magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly did not leave the killer with any chance to repent, a flame arrow has been shot from the hand. This four-level magic is more effective than fireball in terms of single lethality, and it has a soul tracking effect. After the flame arrow, it was the acid arrow, and then a flame arrow. After doing this, Richard had turned and ignored the killer's ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the killers didn't go well. They looked at the rows of barbarian warriors who were surrounded by them, and everyone was bleak. The barbarian warriors with armor and heavy shields are completely mobile barriers, and there are sandmen knights in the periphery. When the last giants and thamidos with giant axes and warhammers appeared, they were completely desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a particular environment, the killer is unbeatable. However, if they are placed on the battlefield and confronted with infantry, it is an absolute tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under heavy axes, giant swords and warhammers, most of the killers became corpses in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard slowly inserted the long knife into the scabbard on his back, looked up and looked into the distance. At this time, Clark came over and said, "All enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not yet!" Richard shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Clarke said, "The battle on the other side of the caravan is not over yet, but they can't escape."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head again and said, "No! I am not talking about the caravan. There is still a guy who has escaped, forget it, and chase can't catch up. Just like this!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is that?" Clark asked doubtfully. He didn't feel anything different, but he saw that Richard was always on alert, and he understood that Richard had noticed something he had not found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a giant rock a few hundred meters away from the battlefield, a shooter emerged, and the giant bow that is taller than the body is striking. He slowly took the giant bow, and a long enchanted long arrow on the bow never had a chance to shoot. He no longer hesitated, but a whistle, calling a black horse from the peak of the stone behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooter turned over and couldn’t help but glanced at Richard’s direction. The super vision was on this flat terrain, which allowed him to see clearly. The action to Richard, even the most subtle expression on his face is vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place, just pointing him at the corner, and then made a cut throat with his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooter’s heart suddenly turned cold, turned to the horse’s head, and left at full speed. He knows that the super-range magic shooter like himself is a natural enem of the magician. His magic tracking arrow is beyond the range of most magic, and it is powerful enough to easily penetrate the long-range attack defense enchantment. Therefore, the person that Richard most wants to kill must be him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooter looked up at the sky and saw a few huge bats flying in the air hundreds of meters, watching the familiar black shadows The sky, can not help but feel the fear of life. These bats must have something to do with Richard, maybe they found the Black Wing and his men. However, the former shooter has never heard of such a magical pet. I have never seen a bat that can fly for a long time under the scorching sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has killed more than a dozen magicians, but after seeing twelve incredible fireballs and swords, Richard’s The means almost subverted all his knowledge of magical common sense, and the fear of the unknown shrouded him like a huge shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to the distant striker, but to the black wing. The black wing fell to the ground and did not move, and the body was still braving the smoke. When Richard went to the side of the black wing, he did not look at it at all, but he took the knife and smashed it. Obviously he played the idea of ​​filling the knife. Sinclair's long knife has an extremely rare extinction attribute, which is a precious knife with a total of six enchantments. It is precious because of ‘extinction’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristics of the 'extinction' attribute is just like its name. Its power lies in its fierce and sinister nature, and it is almost the enemy of all life. Those who are hit by the 'extinction' attribute will make the wounds extremely difficult to heal. The magical skills below the fifth level have no effect. The magical effect of the fifth level or above is also greatly reduced. It is good to have two or three percent to stay. . Regardless of whether the black wing is dead or alive, it is sure that you will die if you use a long knife. It is useless to save your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and the black wing suddenly bounced from the ground, and the dull sword in his hand stabbed to Richard! However, Richard's reaction was almost beyond imagination, and the short sword was opened directly with a long knife, and then the backhand was sent to the black wing chest! The black-winged face showed a tinge, and ignored the knife. Instead, the sword kept the original direction of attack and straightened to the heart of Richard. It was obviously the same idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the long knife suddenly missed, and the strong traction on the blade made the black wing almost unable to hold the sword. He tried his best to pierce Richard's robe, but the edge of the blade couldn't move any more than the meat, as hard as cutting on the dragon skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s long knife has pierced the heart of the black wing! There was no expression on Richard's face, and both hands held the handle and twisted it to break the heart of the black wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackwing eyes suddenly sluggish, the shorts are no longer able to move forward even if it is a point, he stared at Richard, screaming in vain. At this time, he discovered that Richard’s body occasionally flashed a layer of divine power and finally lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has two powerful magical effects on his body. It is undoubtedly a delusion to want to go with such a guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shock and unwillingness, the black wing fell again, and this time it can no longer stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the horror of the Black Wing before his death, there was a kind of unspeakable happiness in Richard’s heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already knew that the Black Wing was pretending to be dead, waiting for him to come close and then making a final blow. Therefore, Richard is going to go to the black wing to fill the knife, let him rekindle hope, thinking that life can be used to complete the final task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magic of Richard’s body has the last few seconds to take effect, and the physical defense of Richard, who has been blessed by double high-level magic, is almost the same as magic. . However, even if the Black Wing knew that Richard had the magical skills, he had to work hard. When he continues to pretend to die, he will be turned into a real death by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black wing first climbs to the peak of hope, and then falls into the abyss of despair, this feeling is really unspeakable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Richard suddenly discovered that only this kind of knife to the meat to kill, can best vent their emotions. So on the battlefield, there will always be fierce characters shouting and killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle over the caravan is nearing its end, and the escorts are in chaos after several rounds of throwing. The next step is a one-sided slaughter. In this battle, the guns of the Demon Guns showed their strong fighting power for the first time. With them, no one in the entire caravan could escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a place to clean the battlefield and rescue the wounded. Some people did not have much interest in the goods on the truck. Anyway, the goods shipped by a second-level caravan will be between 100,000 and 200,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only dug out the broken heart of the black wing, called the tiramisu, and sprinkled the broken heart with the blood. A three-pointed skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-pointed skull suddenly burst into the light, and even sucked some blood into it, and there was a bright blood pattern on the skull. Then a red mist emerges from the nostrils of the skull, and the roar of the ogre can be heard faintly from the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fog flew a few laps in the air and fell into the nostrils of Tiramisu, and it was sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cannibalist stayed for a while, as if he had not understood what had happened. After a long time, he suddenly sat on the ground and held a three-point cooked The skull burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-pronged soul is freed from his skull, but in this way, he truly disappears from the world. Or he will exist in another way, blending with Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
