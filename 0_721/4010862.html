			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers have strengths close to the sanctuary, behind them, Out of the three apparently taller and more burly fighters, they are all strong in the sanctuary class, and the long and thick corners on their heads indicate their extraordinary identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously these fighters are honored in the barbarian tribe. When they appear, many barbarians and civilians are directly on the ground and sing praises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this did not bring them good luck, when the ogre big lord with a hundred build knights, sneer in front of the battle, the ending of the battle It is already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent one morning defeating all resistance, occupying the valley, and then relying on worker bees and other combat units to thoroughly search the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard examined the soldiers who rushed out of the cave, and the brows were slightly wrinkled, saying: "It is a warrior formed by the blood of the devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris looked around and said, "I smell the taste of the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There are fallen gods." The mother's nest added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The atmosphere of death is also very strong." This is Sandro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not eager to enter the cave, but to release the perception, to explore the surrounding space rules and energy trends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, in this valley, there are many changes in the rules of the Faro's own plane, and the energy comes from all directions, like a trickle. Infused into the depths of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, go in and see." Richard took the lead and walked into the cave, and the followers sneaked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is actually an unexpectedly vast world, and soon Richard will enter a huge space naturally formed, here is a few hundred meters, nearly 100 meters High, there are numerous stone ladder passages that are hovering up and down on the four walls, and dozens of passages are connected here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge magical array on the ground of the hall. Three giant pools of more than 100 meters long are cut in the center, and the black and red mist is lingering inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central pool is empty, with a huge skeleton on each side, and a humanoid bone on the left, also a hundred meters high, and the right is a The giant beast bone, which has six wings and two wings, and a part of the fork in the tail, turned into two whip tails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some black gas on the left and right cheekbones, and no obvious body has been formed yet, and the deep pool in the center is very obvious, and the one killed by Richard The giant should have been lying here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While seeing the giant beast bone on the right side, Richard held his breath for a while, the characteristics of this cheekbones were too obvious, and the breath was strong and distinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the skeleton of a star beast. Although the size of the body should be a young star beast, the complete star beast bone is extremely rare even in Noland. The starburst skeleton of the big point can be used to make space props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of this star beast bone is also on the slain giant, while the sacrum in the left pool, although Richard has not had time to study Understand what it is, but the power of powerful rules contained in it has revealed its value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the three giant pools, some barbarians dressed in gray robes are busy, they look like sacrifices or shamans, when they see Li When they walked into the hall, they all exclaimed, and they put down their work and greeted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barbaric man who is already old is taking a few steps forward and majesticly said to Richard: "Leave here, the intruder, you have trampled For the holy land that belongs only to God, you can still be forgiven if you leave now. Otherwise, the greatest God will be angry, his anger will burn the earth, and his bodyguard will tear you into pieces."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and pointed to the central giant pool and said, "Guard, do you mean the huge guy who was lying here, if it is, it is very Unfortunately, it has been torn into pieces by me, oh, forgot to say, I am very satisfied with its heart and cheekbones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old barbarian listened The whole body trembled, and at the moment he did not know what to say. He suddenly made a roar of sorrow and anger, and he collided with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't have to think about it. Next to Zonghu's foot, he let him fall to the ground. He was so painful and lost the ability to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians in the mountain have almost no force, and they are all easily defeated, but the next interrogation is not smooth, these barbarians are stubborn, no matter What kind of punishment is used, they are not willing to say a word, and they are determined, and all kinds of spiritual temptations are completely ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Richard was helpless, Achilles came up and whispered in the ear of Richard: "His Highness, I have a way to let them speak." But the process is not so pleasant, you need to avoid it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and finally nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris waved people to move all the barbarians to a room next to them. After a while, there was a scream of screams. That kind of voice, just listening to it feels the pain from the soul, and those who have been killed and killed are also somewhat unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the screams finally disappeared, and Achilles came out as usual, and said to Richard: "His Royal Highness, all that needs to be known has been asked." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark magician asks the word in the mouth, so that everyone has an awkward feeling that can't be said, Tiramisu is holding something, water flower Then he locked his brow and didn't want to look at him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at everything in his eyes and understood that although some of his followers had strength over Achilles, experience and sorrow It is still not comparable to the dark gods who have experienced countless battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris forcibly extracted the memory of the barbarian's soul, so that the memory is only a few scattered pieces, the dark gods put the memory of dozens of barbarians Put together, only to get the complete answer, but after being extracted from the memory, these people can no longer recover from the incompleteness of the soul, and become an idiot with only the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris sorted out the idea and said: "His Highness, these people are responsible for maintaining the operation of the law here and guiding the barbarism in the valley. People worship the so-called only true God, similar to the role of the priests in our church, and they also monitor the operation of the entire squad, and adjust the energy gathered, the purpose of distribution, the most recent three hundred years, most of the energy has been It is used to resurrect the giants in the central resurrection pool, and a small part is used to make the god warriors, that is, the barbarian warriors we met. The three resurrection pools are the messengers of the true gods who need time to resurrect. In less than two hundred years, the ancient giants of the central government can wake up completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are their purposes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris said: "Open the plane of the plane, let the true God descend directly to this plane, thus making the plane power Get promoted and become a new, more powerful new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this statement, Richard scoffed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the gods of this plane, once the strong presence of other planes enters a low-level plane, the first thing to do is to transform the plane environment and even change. Partial plane rules make it more suitable for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result will undoubtedly have a dramatic impact on the creatures in this plane, and even directly lead to the extinction of life, which is already common sense in Noland. Even the common sense that magic apprentices know, but these Faroes barbarians obviously can't understand so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So any invitation to the true God is a stupid suicide in the eyes of a legendary Master like Richard, and the so-called true gods are mostly abyssal lords. The existence of such a kind, ferocious and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of humans or barbarians, even the Faro native gods, the longest experience has gone through hundreds of thousands of years, wanting to deceive and use these There are millions of years of great existence, and how can it be, even if it is a fair transaction, there are few successful examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first gave the sub-brain a pre-set command, and then he flew to a protruding platform on the wall, from which you can look down the entire magic array. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has set up a portable workbench on this platform, began to re-enact the giant array in the hall, and study the secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of worker bees began to explore around the hall in the mountain. As they continued to deepen, the mountain structure in the consciousness of Richard was rapidly filling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the secret caves in the mountains were discovered one by one. Most of these caves were closed, and each cave was lined with a magical array similar to the hall. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the cave were carved out of a honeycomb-like lattice, which was equipped with steel cabinets, and the worker bees opened several steel cabinets, steel The cabinet is filled with a pale yellow translucent liquid, filled with a faint smell of rancidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
