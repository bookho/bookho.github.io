The scrolls contain a series of names of gods, each of which corresponds to a section of color, placed together, a black to white, intermittent chromatogram. He took the chromatogram and carefully checked the color next to the pillar of fire. On the chromatogram, you can see that the god of courage corresponds to orange-red, but the pale gold is blank. Just a thick golden red ribbon nearby. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the magic scroll was completely burned, Clark only took a breath and wiped the sweat on his forehead, and it looked exhausted. He was very careful to roll the reel and collect it in the most close-fitting pocket, which made it a little easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small scroll does not have any special power. The only difference is the chromatogram listed above, which includes almost any known surface. A god. At the core of those chromatograms, there is a trace of the power of the true god. However, after the scrolls were closed, the divine power disappeared without a trace, and the material of the reel was very special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of humanity and even other races, as long as it is the area covered by the true god beliefs, whoever is found with this scroll, then the only ending is to be God lowered the gods and then tied them to the firearm to burn directly. Even if he was the king of the world or the pope of a true god, he could not be spared. If it is the top powerhouse in the plane, the secular power has been difficult to form a bond with him, then the gods may also drop the punishment, and even directly send the incarnation to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small scroll, in the most advanced secrets of the Temple of Gods, is called "The Book of the Gods" and belongs to the first sequence to be One of several prohibited items found and destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the land of blood is always the abandonment of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the three old men are watching Clark, and Clark is thinking and carefully sorting out the ideas, saying: "The power of this god is mostly It really comes from the god of courage. If you change someone else, I am afraid I will not notice any abnormality. However, there is a slight faint other power in the power of Nei An. If it is nature... it is probably between time. Between God Luna and the god of stability, Xerxes. We know that Lunai is in charge of time, and Xerxes has a space in the priesthood. Besides them, no other true God has the attributes of time and space. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman said slowly: "In other words, is this true power that does not belong to the true face of this plane? Is it the evil spirit from the ectopic plane?" Clarke shook his head and said, "You can't say that. He can hide his power within the power of Nei An. It is obvious that the rules of this plane are very Familiar. The gods from the ectopic face can't do this. And the rules that this fascinating power shows, the part that I can touch, have surpassed the demigod and are close to the true god. So the bigger possibility is that we have one more unknown in this plane. Half-god, and ready to start to attack the true god priesthood. So these scrolls are smudged scrolls made by real clerics, not fakes of a great magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence in the secret room, the atmosphere is so depressed that people panic. A new deity will be born, and the meaning of this matter is incomparably significant for the entire plane. The people, things and interests involved can be overthrown by the state, can be exterminated, and can even tear the mainland and fill the ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a major event is in front of you. These four old people have their own secret identities and they all have good powers, but at this moment, They are all very small and not worth mentioning. In the presence of the true God, the entire blood-stained land is nothing, let alone a specific force inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
