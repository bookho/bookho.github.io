			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, what happened?" Gangde asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened his eyes and said, "Be prepared, we have to fight again, it may be a hard fight!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde slammed, opened his mouth and said, "Good thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water flower is gently licked Lips, eyes are also lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are mostly in a good spirit, have been walking in the boring forest for a long time, and the last battle is also very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sensed the position of the mother's nest and accelerated to the battlefield. After a few kilometers, the terrain gradually tilted down, and then a swamp shrouded in a gray mist appeared in the crowd's view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thick fog, the huge figure of the mother's nest is looming, and people who see it can't help but lose sight of it. Even the ogre brothers, who saw the height of more than two meters, had a six-meter-long mother's nest from head to tail, and stopped. Three-pointed and hard to grasp the helmet, it seems that some do not want to believe their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is fighting, it keeps making a sharp squeak, moving awkwardly and slowly, and the acid splashes around, wide and slightly The dry belly is constantly shrunk, and every agitation will spray a large yellow-green thick fog from the folds of the folds, and a strong sour and spicy smell can be heard from a long distance. Ten meters around the nest is covered with this acid mist. Even the ogres, who are naturally resistant to rough skin, do not dare to rush into this fog that is comparable to the power of the sixth-order spell acid mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s pupils shrink, although the fog of the marshes and the acid mist of the nest are intertwined with great influence, but he has already seen the battle with the nest. Hundreds of undead creatures! And there are more uncountable undead creatures coming out of the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the mother's nest, more than a dozen of the most violent beasts with injuries and the number of undead creatures killed by ten times. Although these undead creatures are low-level scorpions and zombies, it is difficult for them to repel them, whether they are biting or slamming. Breaking an arm or cheekbone does not affect the activities of undead creatures unless they are Completely crushed. The acid or acid mist attack of the female nest has limited effect on the undead. Although the white bones are corroded and squeaky, they are constantly blackening, but it takes a while to make them lose their ability to move. It is better to use the pair of small blades. Cutting is still easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is in the edge of a swamp, mud is everywhere, and the speed advantage of the fast beast is difficult to play in this terrain. The cockroaches and the zombies went one after another to the fast beast. The rapid physical strength of the beast has been consumed to the limit, and it is overwhelmed by one eye. Thousands of cockroaches and zombies are rushing into the mud, and the swift beast is completely pressed into the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large size of the nest is covered with cockroaches and zombies, surrounded by at least hundreds of undead creatures. However, the attack power of the low-level undead creatures is quite limited. For the time being, it is still unable to bring substantial damage to the nest, and it can not break the outer shell of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are there so many undead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother's nest, stop releasing acid mist!" Richard quickly judged that the acid mist had limited damage to the undead, but he did not dare to approach the mother. Around the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, a strong spiritual fluctuation suddenly came from the depths of the swamp and fell directly on the mother's nest. The nest's movements immediately stopped and screamed in pain. And Richard, who is connected with the nest's soul, also feels that the consciousness is like a needle stuck in it. It seems that a white light passes through the mind, and the brain seems to be emptied instantly. This feeling is only a moment, and all the contracts in consciousness suddenly light up. Bright, the white light immediately broke apart and split into several strands, and Richard immediately resumed waking, leaving only a little bit of pain to show that it was not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic of the spirit system, the spirit whip moss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of the blank of the nestin consciousness, another spiritual wave came from the depths of the swamp, this time the mother nest lost its body in an instant. control. Although the loss of control was only a short moment, the mother's nest returned to normal, but Richard noticed the essence of the latter mental fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental Control! In the hands of many great magicians who are proficient in spiritual magic, this is the prelude to controlling the magic pet, and then the magic slavery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the mother’s nest is connected to the soul of Richard, and that Richard is connected through the soul contract and the water flower, and the four professionals who signed the magic contract. How can it be possible to control the mother's nest and control all the people? The will of Richard himself is extremely firm. The will of Gangde is not much weaker than that of Richard. The two ogres and the will of Oral are not weak. However, in this attack, the most surprising thing is the splash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​this girl has always been clean and simple, the soul is pure as a cup of white water, but when the control intentions in the spirit fluctuations appear, the water sprays like a volcano. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s short hair with no wind erected, her mouth uttered a silent scream, and a very pure killing screamed, swaying along the spirit And the line, the fierce counterattack! Although Richard was a little surprised, he did not hesitate to extend his spiritual strength, such as a fuel-burning agent, which made the killings more vigorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar in the depths of the swamp, and all the undead creatures were still alive for a while before they acted again, this time their movements were obviously slower. The offensive also appeared chaotic, and there was no more rigorous front line and cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flash of cold in the eyes of Li, and he said, "It seems that there is a necromancer who is hiding here. He wants to control his mother's nest. His appetite is really true." Not too small, courage is also big enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei’s right hand stretched out and said: "Knife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A stepping knight sent the nameless knife to Richard. The sand drifted silently and reached for a touch on the long knife, so that the blade immediately burned a faint sacred fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watery eyes brighten, silently put the perpetual guide to the front of the sand. The sand drifted his eyes and looked at the girl, only to reach out to the flames of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing is good!" Gangde shouted loudly, and his cheeks stretched out his big axe. After a while, everyone’s weapons were burning with holy flames. According to Liu Sha, this holy flame can burn for about nine minutes, which is equivalent to her gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s order, the mother’s nest has climbed out of the edge of the swamp and slowly moved towards the crowd. Behind it, the yellow-green acid mist still lingers. The remaining ten fast beasts also got rid of the entanglement of low-order undead creatures and began to move closer to Richard. As for all the worker bees, Richard has seen their bodies in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
