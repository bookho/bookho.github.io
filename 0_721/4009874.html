			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the bits and pieces of these two days, and even entering the Faro All the things since the face, Richard suddenly felt the blood boiling, the inspiration generated by the conversation with the quicksand again appeared again, and more and more clear. It is like a naughty flame, jumping, and constantly tempting Richard in front, but refuses to let him catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not worry, but stopped, not to capture it, but quietly thinking. At this moment, the magical philosophical thoughts that have been studied in the dark blue have come up. Almost every teacher will yell a sentence before the class, "Thinking is everything" and it will continue to echo in his mind. Richard found that he has been passively responding to changes around him, and rarely thinks about the path he is really ready to take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More powerful strength is just an empty slogan, through which means to gain strength, and on which road can go further. It is a more realistic issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as is known, the Faro plane is almost indistinguishable from Noland, and the rules are similar. Although the upper limit of the strength of the Faro plane is lower than that of Noland, it is also a plane that can produce legendary power. The suppression of this rule power, at least the current Richard can not feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a series of battles, other differences between the two planes have been fully shown. If Richard encounters an enemy with a seemingly competitive power on the surface, the final result will basically be a big victory or even a victory. Apart from the unique factors such as quicksand, Richard himself, the mother's nest, water flowers and Gangde, the biggest difference between Nolan and Faro's planes is already coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic makeup! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical pattern that has evolved over thousands of years in Noland is the ultimate expression of the perfect application of magical knowledge in war. Gangde only loaded a structure and was able to compete with opponents who were two or three times higher. If he can get the full set of suits for himself, then he can beat the thunder hammer of level four! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard construction knights developed with the support of the magical texture technology can be said to have the power of the Faro plane. The magic pattern will increase the level of the Cavaliers of the 13th and 4th level to the level of 17 or even 18, and it will create a large number of Sanctuary strongmen out of thin air. If the Faro plane can be resisted in front of Noland, according to the number of original planes in the plane, then the appearance of the magic pattern, and the resulting thousands of equivalents to the Holy The formation of the knights in the field of warfare can easily tear down all the resistance of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard himself, his talent, his status, his resources, and even all his special features, in fact, mostly come from the magic pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard was deeply impressed by the importance of magic philosophy. It does not tell Richard the path to success that is sure to win, but teaches him how to think and provides a framework for thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the answer has been found, the inspiration will come to fruition. In Richard’s opinion, the spark of inspiration floating in front of him is completely complete. The things in it can be caught by reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard reached out and grasped the spark of inspiration, and then realized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captured the inspiration, but Richard still refused to let go, but the palm of his hand began to increase the power of kneading. The feeling of the flames of the group also changed, disappearing from the consciousness of Richard, but the hand began to convey a very soft and soft feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the slightly hoarse voice of the flowing sand rang in the ear: "You are pinching my ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am capturing inspiration." Zhang opened his eyes and saw the sand flowing by the bed, his hand was caught on her fart/strand. However, Richard did not let go, but instead squeezed it a little more vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it? Is it wrong?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "Now? Of course I am touching your fart/share!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted a step to the bed, which made it easier for Richard to touch, and the place to touch was more extensive. Not only that, she also asked: "Do you want to take off my clothes? But seeing your current physical condition, it seems that it is not very suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察哼With one voice, he reached for a shot on the sand buttocks. The result was too strong, and the wound on his chest was touched. He immediately got a white face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to endure the pain, and Li spit out a sigh of gas and said, “Come on me, I know you have a way!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted while removing the bandage on Richard, and said: "Just just thought of a method, it can not be solved. The power of the shadow is not so simple, from the power level In fact, it is actually more profound than the power of the gods of this plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bandage was removed, the wound on the chest of Richard was revealed. . The three wounds did not close at all, but they were piled up with thick ointment before they continued to bleed. On the ointment, a layer of black gas does not fade, and in the perspective of Richard, you can see the faint shadows lingering. The flowing sand takes out a bottle containing colorless and transparent water. But as soon as the cap opened, the sigh of divine power rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be some pain, endure the point." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and did not care. His will is very firm and he is quite confident in his tolerance for pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand hand pours, the water in the bottle pours down and is poured on Richard's wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contact between the water and the shadow of the shadow on the wound is as if it is poured in a hot oil pan, and it immediately slams and splatters. Rising up a large stream of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the sudden pain caused Richard’s consciousness to be blank, and the body suddenly bounced off the bed and fell back heavily. This is completely an instinctive reaction of the body under severe pain, and Richard also opened his mouth and the entire face began to distort. Being able to control is not called, it is already his limit, and the depth of his throat is still a few roars of wild beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of a pain, it is totally tortured! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after being drenched by the Holy Water, the force of the shadow that has been entrenched on the wound has finally dissipated, and even a glimpse of the black line is entangled with the Holy Light. Reluctantly fade away in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand begins to chanting the spell, two consecutive powerful treatments fall on Richard, so under the magical effect, the wound on the chest is visible to the naked eye. The speed began to heal, leaving only a faint red line. In two or three days, the wound will heal completely. Then the sand continues to chanting the spell. This time, the spell is three or four times longer than the powerful treatment, and the power consumed is also increased accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
