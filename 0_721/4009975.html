			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xim, you are my captive now." Richard smiles Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Yes, I can pay the ransom! How much do you want, though, my family is very, very rich, as long as you are willing to let me go! You Is a real aristocrat, will certainly abide by the rules of war between the nobility, right? Don't kill me, don't kill me!" Heim said that in the end, he began to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark and deep forest, the delicate and fat body of Him is extremely dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ransom is of course necessary." Richard said slowly. His words immediately let Him's collapsed nerves relax, and then the suppressed fear can no longer be suppressed, and actually burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Richard was another turning point, and Heim’s crying came to an abrupt end. Richard approached Him and approached him until the two faces were close to less than twenty centimeters. He slowly said: "I need you to remember my face and my name! This is the last time with you. The request mentioned, but now it seems that your memory is not so good, so I need to help you to strengthen your memory. How many whip did I give you last time? It seems to be a dozen or so, oh, look, my Memory is not very good. So double this time, thirty whip, maybe you will not forget who I am!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde The long whip rises like a viper, and falls on the back of the viscount, leaving a high swollen welt. Hem screamed fiercely, his whole body was struggling, and even began to incontinence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back, leaning on a big tree, closing his eyes and raising his mind, counting the number of whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde's lower whip is very close, the whip marks never overlap, and the black and purple whip marks are not broken. The hematoma will stimulate the nerves and enlarge the pain of Him. The whip marks almost all over Him, but he didn't really hurt him, especially if he didn't touch his armpits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to slash 30, and he has not moved, only the slap. Until the sand came over and gave him several treatments in a row, the Viscount was barely able to lie on the back of Gangde and was carried out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the battle, the mother nest is no longer needed, so the mother's nest returns to the turbulent land. Before returning, the mother's nest reminded Richard that it needed a lot of magic crystals, or something similar in energy, so that it could be further strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some helplessness in the request of the mother's nest. No matter which plane is the magic crystal, the magic crystal is a high-purity crystal rich in energy. After the mother's nest is promoted, the number of magic crystals required to open a new ability is also rising. Now that the mother's nest has reached the fourth order, the new ability in the fourth order requires 40 magic crystals to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the mother nest as a plane war machine is gradually being exerted. When the size of the throwing soldiers is in groups, the power begins to rise geometrically. But again, in line with the huge role, the consumption of the nest is equally astonishing. In order to raise the hen's nest to the fourth order, Richard has invested in all the wealth that a baron can possess, and in the foreseeable future, the wealth of the duke is not enough to feed the hen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mother's nest has no limits, or the limits of evolution are very high, maybe there will be a day in the future, and the power of the whole plane must be raised to support the mother's nest. Consumption. Thinking of this, Richard suddenly frowned, and a little unsuccessful thoughts flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie took prisoners of Him and his guards and joined his own large forces. At this time, it is only time to count the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war lasted for several days, and the army of Viscount Heim was eventually wiped out by the army, with more than one-third of the war dead and one-third of the wounded, and the rest. They all became the captives of Richard. Richard did not plan to attack the Viscounts’ wounded camps. It would only add a lot of burden to himself, but would not get much more ransom. There are dozens of elite knights among the more than 400 captives, but the added value of them will not exceed the number of Viscounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day of rest, Richard gathered the troops and returned to the territory with prisoners who were twice as many as themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, Liu Sha and Richard walk side by side. Not far from them, Viscount Heim also rode on the horse and was squatted by several sandmen. Among the captives, only the Viscount has the advantage of riding, and other soldiers have to walk. After learning that Richard was ready to collect the ransom, the prisoners’ hanging hearts fell, and there was no other thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Him's back, frowning and frowning, said faintly: "I don't like this guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I really like him," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can feel that he has not completely died. You put him this time, and it will take long before he will come to us for trouble. Are you going down? I am going to hit him sixty whip? Isn't that the same as killing him directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "He came to us for trouble, that Isn't it a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it's a good thing, to Him's Personality, before I avenge myself, I will certainly prevent others from coming to us for trouble, so as not to avenge myself. In my case, I would rather have an enemy like Him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; After Richard explained, the sand was stunned, but he stared at Richard and said, "Sometimes I really feel like you are starting to be an old man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha snorted and said: "If you talk about it, you have always been better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is straight up and put on a pair Pure and flawless expression, : "I have been brought up in the temple, I do not understand anything." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; to see her appearance, Richard and hate teeth itch. If it is not on the road, most of them will have to press her down. At that time, it will be a big drama of resistance and conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But somehow, Richard suddenly thought of Su Helun. This kind of disguise innocent, pure and pure drama, if it is played by the legendary mage, is the most suitable. When she thought of her, Richard suddenly had some thoughts that could not stop her heart, and there was a kind of inexplicable sourness. When I first arrived at Faro, Richard did not dare to think about her, because he did not know if he could return to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now the initial crisis, the return to Noland has finally had the first line of dawn, and Richard dared to turn these memories out in the depths of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not notice the subtle changes in Richard’s mood. She was thinking about something. After a while, she said, “What about Palin, what are you going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to deal with it?" Richard glimpsed, but he never thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
