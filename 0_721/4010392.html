			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, Richard found a safe place to start cooking. The wound, on his ventral side, has a deep opening with a few fragments of gravel embedded in it, the wound is burning hot, and everything in the battlefield is poisonous to the Nolanders. The same is true for the Daksodas. Although the plane is dead, the residual source of power is instinctively hating all life, and the breath it emits is the atmosphere of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a short knife and a spare small blade, began to clean up the wound, picked out the debris inside, and cut off the bitter venom The erosive carrion, the whole process, Richard is meticulous and calm, and this kind of battlefield dealing with the wounds is exactly what Lawrence taught. For the strong people who are not clergy, the techniques are good and bad, sometimes life and death. The difference, a moment later, Richard sealed the wound, stood up and began to go deeper in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Richard bowed his body and carefully moved forward with the cover of every terrain, a few hundred meters in front of him, a demon People are wandering around and looking for their own prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, Richard’s physical strength was close to dryness, but the demon had become a corpse, and the hardship of this battle was beyond imagination. I found that my magic still couldn't keep up with the consumption of the fierce battle. The temporary staring of the magic star talent made him dare not use the ability to sacrifice. So now Richard has become very patient, and every battle must be extremely embarrassing. Use every bit of physical strength and magic of each point, like the most terrible miser. If he has become a big magician, this kind of battle does not have to worry about the magic, but Richard is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, after harvesting two mouse devils and one devil fish again, Richard finally felt that the harvest was enough and needed to return to the sun. They all went to rest and digest, but when he didn't go out for a long time, he was stopped by a black magician and four mouse devils. What was terrible was that there was a devil fish at the foot of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still sent his enemies into the world of death and lived back to the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he was lying on Lawrence’s operating table for a long time, until this time, Richard realized why he saw the white night lying on Lawrence’s On the operating table, counting this time, Richard is already lying on this icy iron platform for the third time, and he will definitely lie more times later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys, in addition to giving me trouble, what else to do," Lawrence is rare and angry, while roaring while he is treating, people worry that his saliva will spray into Richard's wound, or maybe Will not use too much force, cut a piece of internal organs or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Richard is very interested in the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White night, she is a real madman, and you, too much, and I have seen three madmen, but they are now changing It’s dead,” Lawrence said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha thought, very seriously said: "Actually, I feel that in this kind of battle, it is the easiest to upgrade myself, where is injured, where is the most The fatal flaws, as well as the way I see the Dakosodas fighting, often make me inspired. We always think from the human point of view, so there are actually many natural blind spots..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, these words caused Lawrence to break out: "If you do it, if you raise it a few more times, it will become dead like the other three madmen. Do you think that you are the same as the white night, her blood is one of the most horrible heavenly blood in the entire Holy Alliance, and she is a machine born for the battle, you, this talent can only be regarded as Ordinary only, how is the blood of Archimonde, not to mention a lot, but comparable to the royal family and the great man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence is next The allergic face of the cloaked face was about to get Richard’s bloody sprinkler, but Richard’s from a series of dirty I heard a lot of concerns, so I smiled and explained: "In fact, I am not taking risks, but I have a lot of confidence to be able to come back alive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Great grasp, a lot of you will become like this." Lawrence is even more angry when he hears Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t explain wisdom and real talent, so he had to be silent, let Lawrence be happy. After a few hours, Richard was almost from the store by Lawrence. Throw it out, and there is a magic box that was thrown out behind him. It contained a high-level sacrifice. This is Lawrence’s sale of the Richards and the purchase of a sufficient amount of magic material. The rest of the money was bought, of course, on the face of the former sectarian, the price was a lot of discounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha picked up the magic box and watched Lawrence close the door of the store. He only smiled and shook his head. He returned to his place of residence and met along the way. When they got to know a lot of people, they greeted each other with enthusiasm, and on the stone platform in front of Richard, they had put a stack of envelopes. Richard took the letters back to the room and read them one by one. Read it carefully. Before this departure, the structure that Richard made was designed according to one of the first three letters. This incident has already caused a strong response, so this time a large number of strong people They all recorded their needs and placed them at the door of Richard, in order to be able to be seen by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every letter is like a lamp, illuminating the way forward for Richard, and one idea constantly emerges from the mind, so that Richard has the impulse to make the structure immediately, but now Richard I was very patient. After reading all the letters, I chose one of the most mature and gradually improved solutions among many ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days seem to have been repeated, Richard meditates, draws the costumes, occasionally drinks on the open space outside the door, and the people who drink with Richard The more and more, the more people who grew up with Richard, know that he only likes to say gossip when drinking, and if he mentions topics such as makeup, Richard will only laugh and not talk. There are also people who are anxious, bullying Richard, wanting to let Richard give priority to making things for himself. As a result, Richard did not do anything, and even did not express his opinion. The strong people who had drunk together put the man into a fight. Half dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is like a sieve, it will screen out those who are not suitable for being friends, and those who share the same interests will stay together, and Richard will leave the day again and again. All of them, come back again and again, gradually, the people who are willing to drink with him are fixed, because people finally know that when Richard drinks, he just drinks, and no one can get any benefit from accompanying him, Richard made Whoever benefits from the construction will depend on God’s will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no good thing, and gradually few people are willing to do it. The people who stayed are really taking Richard as a friend. These people are used to the look of Richard, the bunch of hair, the messy beard, the bohemian manners, they are used to Richard’s occasional laughter, and the long silence, no one knows Li. What are you thinking about, what are you thinking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard’s storeroom, more and more statues are becoming more and more vivid, and the knife marks on the walls are now measured as the most sophisticated. There will be no slight deviation. In the bedroom of Richard, there are more and more magic boxes containing sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, Richard will lie in bed, look at the ceiling, I don’t know what to think about, just in such a recurring day, Richard seems to be sinking, people I am used to what he is now, and forgot his appearance when he first came. Richard is like dust, but in the sinking, Richard feels that something is about to break out, in the eyes of others. Like Li, Licha is becoming deeply imprinted with the brand of the battlefield and the city of the sun. Richard also seems to be in this unchanging, recurring life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, not only can change a person, but also change the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, time is the knife of the Dragon Slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is farther and farther away from the day, the time is getting longer and longer, and the things brought back are more and more precious, the only one is disturbing. Yes, there are more and more devil fish appearing around the sun, and the ordinary big magisters are now even accompanied by the servants to dare to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent battles, Richard always has some kind of vague feeling, and he seems to be stared at by something. This feeling is very vague, even Richard I myself have some doubts about whether I have a lot of heart. However, when Richard stood on a small plain and suddenly found the unusual silence around him, he knew that he really did not care much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of five devil fish appeared one after another, surrounded by Richard. On the periphery of them, Richard saw a tall demon who was familiar with him. It was the one I saw across the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been paying attention to you for a long time." The devil actually greeted Richard with Nolande human lingua franca, but his voice was very hoarse. Weird, just like two stones rubbing against each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, I look more delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you are very Potential, and you are probably the kind of person known as the 'constructor', as long as you catch you back, I will have a large number of merit awards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha smiled and asked: "You and I said this, not to let me surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very smart, so I think we I can talk, don't resist, I won't hurt you, the dead have no value to us. If you die, then I will have to eat you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Richard looked around and the demon seemed to see his heart, sneer: "Don't fantasize again, in order to catch you, I deliberately brought five heads of Sasma, you can't escape." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in the population of Daksodas, the devil fish was originally called Sasuma, and the words of this devil revealed an important Information, that is this Devil Rays did obey their command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first put the knife on the ground, and then began to carefully organize the equipment, throwing all unnecessary things on the ground, watching him do Everything, the devil can't help but say: "Do you still want to resist, that is, there are three of you, and you can only escape at most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
