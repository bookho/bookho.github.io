After thinking for a while, he asked faintly: "The same report must now be handed to the god of stability, the god of time, and the new god Ludre Is the Pope of Sri Lanka?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal slammed down and shouted: "Ah! This, I really don't know, this report is I... really is me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope raised his hand and the Cardinal immediately received the voice, and the Pope said faintly: "Remember, We are the servants of God, in the presence of God, every sentence spoken. You are responsible. If you don't think about it, then go back and think about it. If you think about it, come back to me. You can also take it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Cardinal took back the report, almost grateful to zero, and then stepped back out of the Pope's office, and then dared to turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope leaned against the back of the chair, closed his eyes and gently rubbed his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his office, there is a ghostly appearance of a beautiful boy, the young man standing behind the pope, with a pair of delicate women’s hands for the pope shoulders, while Whispered: "Ni Xi, the bishop just dared to deceive you, why not punish him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope took a sigh of relief and said: "He did not lie Although there must be some instigation behind this report, Richard is indeed likely to be an intruder from an alien position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Exclaimed, said: "Then we should immediately mobilize the fighting gods and the Knights of the Temple to completely smash the invaders!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sighed heavily. Say: "Do you think about who Richard is, even if he is really an intruder, what do we take to kill him? What if, if not, that means..." The Pope paused, extremely difficult, If you whisper, spit out two words: "New God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man opened his mouth, but could not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly knows Richard’s record, using two years to level the blood-stained land, defeating Salenville twice in succession, and then taking advantage of the incomparable strength Destroy the Sequoia Kingdom Masters Association, forcing the Masters Association to compromise and give up the magical equipment management rights that have never been let go. Afterwards, Richard disappeared for a period of time. When he reappeared, he led an indescribable embarrassment and led several thousand iron riders into the territory of the Iron Triangle Empire. As the wind and the clouds swept through, it was like no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a person, only by the Temple of the Gods and the Knights of the Temple, if you can win, it is really an idiotic dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more famous with Richard's record is his Masters and Gods. Although they have already learned that the priesthood of Richard is based on the pastor of the three goddesses, who does not know the true strength of the three goddesses? I dare not touch the truth because it is a word that is a hundred times heavier than the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the realm of God. Once the banquet of the mortal is touched, even if the original intention was to protect the faith, there is no forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, do we let him do this?" The boy was not willing to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can only be like this, unless there is a new god." The Pope said a little tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager is silent again. Of course, he knows that the god of courage, Zhong'an, has not lowered his god for a long time, and even the pope cannot communicate with his will. And since this time, the divine power of the priests and pastors has not increased, but has slowly declined. For a time, people are upset. In this troubled autumn, it is not wise to go and provoke a big enemy like Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, the pope suddenly shocked the whole body and stood up! The boy was shocked. He still didn't understand what happened. The pope rang the satin rope at the table, and the ringing of the caller immediately rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, bring my pope! Come on! I feel the god of courage will drop the god again!" The Pope whispered. The teenager was shocked and immediately ecstatic, like flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the bell of the courage of the Great God shouted, the Pope’s head wearing a crown, wearing a robe, holding a golden cane, stumbling over the god of courage Before the image of God. Behind the pope is a row of cardinals. There are quite a few bishops who are not well-dressed. After they are kneeling, they are still hurriedly buttoning their collars and supporting the crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope began to swear by the hymns of the gods, the red cardinal behind him echoed, and the passionate hymns echoed in the tall halls, while the colonnades on both sides After the choir, the boys and girls have straightened their necks, blushing their faces, and exhausted the power of the whole body to raise the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage The Great Shrine gradually began to shine. After a moment, a stalwart, huge will quietly came, and the temple suddenly cheered! Some cardinals are even excited to faint! For the clergy, God is everything to them, and the more senior the clergy, the more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope was all on the ground and listened to the voice of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are very powerful intruders that will appear in the territory of the Baroque Kingdom in a month. Every effort must be made to completely destroy the invaders!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest gods have surprised the Pope, and throughout the history, there have been few intruders who have allowed the courageous god to use this very powerful adjective, more than this adjective It was only once, that is the battle of the invasion of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other place where the Pope is in a heavy heart is that the will of the god of courage is too vague, even if he listens to some difficulty, it seems that it does not exceed Five cardinals can hear the gods. In the past, the god of courage was so clear that most cardinals could accept it clearly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can have two functions. One is to make the god of courage gods widely known, so that the pope or church high-level monopoly of the gods, take the opportunity to seek personal gains. The second is to test the strength of the belief of the cardinal. The cardinal who has not heard the gods many times will soon be quietly arranged to retire and give way to the new clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the voice of the god of courage is so weak, the pope can almost certainly determine what the state of courage must have, and is currently in a very weak state. I think that some other gods are inexplicably in a state of weakness or even silence. Is it that there is an unknown war on the sky? But not to mention that a few gods have been in the same camp for thousands of years, even if there is a real battle between them, then as the spokesperson of the god of courage in the world, the pope should be informed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the two gods is as important as the war between the kingdom of God and the mortal world. The source of the fight against the faith is the church and believer of the other god, and it is equally important to fight against the gods. It is precisely because of this that the initiators of the war of faith can only be gods, and there is no god to attack other gods without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time after the end of the gods, the Pope slowly stood up. His movements seemed sluggish and old, and he missed a lot of things, such as the horror of most cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Pope turned around, they all recovered their sacred solemnity, and only from the face, they could not tell who had not received the god. Of course, this attitude of the Cardinals does not expect to pass the pope, but to preserve dignity in front of their peers and subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few red cardinals who really accept the gods, but they are not happy, but they are thoughtful. When the gods they believe in have problems, even silence or corruption, then all of these senior priests will be finished. The bishop who can accept the gods can feel the weakness of the god of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishops of the cardinal group, come with me now, we need to hold an emergency meeting." After that, the pope walked behind the chapel. Twelve cardinals followed the pope, but half of them were very calm, and these were accepted by the gods. The other half are somewhat unnatural, and they have never received a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal conference room is classical and solemn, even slightly dignified. The area is not large, just sitting down with the Pope and the 12 Cardinal Red, but the height of the conference room is 12 meters. The magic wall lamp emits some dim light, and even the murals of the god of courage of the dome are looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s gaze only fell in front of him and used the doctrine of not knowing how many generations, slowly said: "You, today’s god, you have I heard it, and I didn’t hear it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the cardinal’s face suddenly panicked. The pope rarely talks about this kind of thing publicly, usually in private conversations, and then makes arrangements that are sufficient to maintain the decent appearance of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope continued: "But this time, it doesn't matter if you don't hear it. The key is how we should implement the great Nei's god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope retelled the gods and all the cardinals fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a normal matter, the church should be as sophisticated as possible, sending a large lineup of fighting gods, gathering the private army of the local aristocracy, and fighting the invaders. But in the current situation, whether it should be done, but it is somewhat debatable. When the gods are weak, his faith in the human world becomes crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The location of the gods, in the Kingdom of Baroque." A cardinal who was almost as old as the Pope reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroque Kingdom! Cardinals quickly flashed through the country's information in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Baroque Kingdom is much stronger than that of the Sequoia Kingdom. There are seven great dukes in the territory, and the territory is vast, and its strength is directly in pursuit of the Empire. If it were not for the Baroque Kingdom to work hard to open a passage connecting the South Sea, I would rather turn around and go north. Then a series of Principalityes around the turbulent land may not have an iron ride that can stop Baroque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the most important point is that the church of Ludreis, the god of war, is located in the Kingdom of Baroque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
