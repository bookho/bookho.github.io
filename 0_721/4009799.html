			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumble of laughter, a whole body wrapped in silver-gray shiny heavy armor The warrior broke open a few leaflet shrubs and strode out. The huge swords of both hands shimmered, and the vindictiveness of the hair excites a layer of light outside the armor. Behind him, more than a dozen soldiers rushed out and split them on both sides, arching them into the sand and four stepping knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a burning fireball suddenly flew out of the side of the woods and shot at the farthest soldiers in the station. The high jazz screamed: "Damn! There is a magician, all pay attention to local defense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is so close, the overall adjustment of the formation is definitely too late, If you run around and provide activity targets for this battlefield artillery, you can only rely on the magician's humming interval to adjust the position to decide whether to open the distance defense or advance the distance charge. On-the-spot crouching is a more effective way to defend against fireball. As for the soldiers who did not take the shield, they can only pray for luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he himself was kneeling on one knee, half a squat, and the giant sword was inserted in front of him, covering his face with a large blade and arm. The key, while stimulating the body vindictively quickly put a layer of defense around the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the first fireball has not yet flown to the position, and the second fireball has already flown out of the woods! The high Jazz's hand trembled immediately, and there was a second magician! The two fireballs appear only one second apart, which may only be the result of two magicians casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want him to think that the first fireball has exploded, and the blazing heat waves swept over him, covering him and nearly half of the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar of the fire, the high jazz heard a cold voice in the direction of the fireball: "Sir, I am really grateful. You, if you don't know the title, I still have difficulty judging your strength!" The other party is talking about lingua franca, but the syllable frequency and tone are flat and mechanical, typical magical language effects. Sure enough, it is an intruder from the ectopic plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and fourth fireballs also flew out of the forest in the roar of high anger. The placement of the four fireballs formed a square centered on the high jazz, and the blast radius just placed the high jazz on the center. And the control skills are excellent, the earliest flying fireball is the farthest, and the nearest fireball is the last shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But between the two breaths, the whole area is raging, and the warrior who was the farthest and the first to move is able to rush out of the sea, but still It was covered with magical flames, and it was tumbling on the ground. As for the central area, there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Jazz in the center of the explosion is suffering a blistering baptism, desperately trying to fight against the burning of the surging magical flame. In less than four seconds, four waves of fire repeatedly washed the high jazz, almost all his vindictiveness was exhausted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last wave of fire finally rolled over, Sir John about to resist the pain of being burned by the fire, struggling to stand up. As soon as he looked up, he saw that Richard was striding out of the woods, and in his hands, another fireball had formed! At this time, Richard and the High York Jazz are less than 20 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn madman!! I cursed you!" The sergeant Gao was so shocked that almost all of his hair was erected. He had no time to think about how many of the trees were in the forest. The magician, but on the battlefield, it was the first time he encountered a spellcasting career and rushed directly to him, with a killing magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard reached out and pushed the fireball to the front, avoiding it. The high-profile jazz screamed, and the body once again screamed with vindictive light. The two-handed sword swayed high, the lightning fell, and a sword hit the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic fireball blasted openly, and the violent impact of the jazz was thrown out. The vindictive light on the armor flashed in vain for a few times and was completely extinguished. Attacking a fireball directly with a weapon can only reduce a little damage, unless there is an enchantment effect or vindictiveness can weaken and counteract the magic. If the battle is to withstand the impact of the fire, it is still dependent on armor and shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High York jazz fell heavily on the ground, the helmet fell off the armor, and a red, black face was burned. The original lush beard and hair have been turned into ash at high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-profile jazz despite the strength of the military, but also can not withstand the continuous bombardment of Richard's five full power fireballs. He is still alive now, that is, high spirits and the result of excellent armor quality. The dozens of warriors who followed the jazz did not have this kind of skill. After being plowed by several fireballs, they have now become coke corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Jazz is struggling to stand upright, only the left eye can open, and the right eye is constantly flowing with blood. He was like a wounded lion. Although he stood still and stood still, he stared at Richard with his one-eyed eyes. He smiled and said: "The eccentric face is not smug, you will die soon!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and made a slap in the air, saying coldly, "That is also after you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gao also wants to say something, the figure of the water flower has flashed from the forest. She is silent, her upper body is lowered at a 45-degree angle to the ground, such as a white ghost lightning, and the moment has passed since the high! At the moment of passing by, the long knife ‘Yongmian Guide’ disappeared in the hands of the water flower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Gao’s head suddenly flew high and pulled out a parabola with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is still standing until the neck spurts blood, and he is still reluctant to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knives have passed, the water is also a sly, just as a star-like stunned blow has consumed her more than half of the power. Just as she was relieved, she suddenly heard Richard’s amnesty: “Hurry to hide!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of perennial life and death made her think without fear And out, a few more tumbling, has flashed to a big tree in an instant. The two spears roared and slammed on the ground she had just stood on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are enemies! Kill them!" Richard yelled, not retreating, striding forward to the soldiers who were constantly pouring out of the woods. And while he was marching, he began to mourn the spell. When he passed by the sand, Richard pointed his right hand forward. After the extremely strong magical fluctuations, four fierce wild boars appeared in the forest, slamming toward the high-jaw jazz soldiers. Rush over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four hundred kilograms of magical creatures are wildly rushing up, and the long fangs and the sharp spurs on the shoulders are deadly weapons. The rock has tough hooves on the ground, making a thunderous thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the High Jazz is still taking the four violent wild boars seriously, those five or six fighters are difficult to have one-on-one. And when they collided with the violent wild boars, they suddenly found that these magical creatures were more difficult to deal with than expected. All the violent wild boars are shining with a faint divine power, and the fierce wild boars who have been blessed with blessings have completely become another kind of creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
