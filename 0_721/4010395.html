			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus is not quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Holy Alliance is talking about the martial arts that will take back the rising sun, and the excitement will not be added. After many years, the bloodthirsty Philip The name of Pu was once again spread all over the world. People remembered the splendid deeds of the emperor’s youth. Some people even turned out some portraits of the year. Although Philip was not handsome at that time, it was just a stop. Domineering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, those who have privately talked about Philip’s population have changed in the past, and they are also eating their brains, before they recover the rising sun. After eating and eating, but after recovering the rising sun, it is now called Shuguang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned to Noland, he did not attract much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a floating world, Richard put things down, he carried a big magic box and went directly to the Eternal Dragon Hall. He was still receiving Nolan. The official, Nolan is obviously radiant and very enthusiastic about Richard. In the past year, she has earned the difference from the acquisition of Faro minerals, which has already reached as many as one million gold coins. As a big priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall, Nolan itself does not need much money, but she has family and relatives, and many friends and relationships that need to be taken care of. Money is never too much. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich, I haven't seen you for a long time, how long have you been in the battlefield, a year, etc..." Nolan suddenly paused, up and down Looking at Richard carefully, he was surprised: "Li Cha, why are you not a big magician, this can't be your bottleneck, but you do have some changes, um, it is very powerful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change." Richard habitually touched his chin, but there was bare, it was already shaved clean, he didn't touch anything, so Richard was even less clear. What is the change that Lan said? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan himself can’t say it, Richard doesn’t seem to change, just a little bit more murderous, coming back from the battlefield, everyone will bring It’s not normal to be murderous in the past, but it’s not normal for Richard to see it. But the more I look at it, the more I think that the change of Richard is so big that it seems to have changed completely. She thought for a long time before she understood it. It is the temperament that has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say this, Richard, you are finally back, what's the matter?" Nolan asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, come to see Vatican and quicksand, another thing, naturally is a sacrifice." Richard said, while putting the back The magic box was thrown on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s eyes are so powerful that at first glance, the magic box is a space device, and the sacrifices in it are certainly not in the minority, and the eyes can’t help but shine. However, he did not ask him who wanted to preside over the sacrifice. Instead, he said to Richard: "It takes a little time for the sand to come back, and the Vatican’s official is not very good recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why." Richard asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but what is certain is that she is in a very bad mood. Are you sure you want to see her?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Richard really hesitated. At this moment, a shrine warrior rushed from the apse, saw Nolan and Richard, and immediately said: "Li Cha, Fan Lin The great priest knows that you are here, I hope you can see her now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will come soon." After that, Richard went to Nolan. Nodded, he followed the samurai to the hall of Vatican's exclusive hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall of Vatican is the same as Richard’s last time. It’s clean and has a feeling of openness. There are no furniture ornaments at this moment, Van Gogh. Lin sat directly on the floor with her knees, and Richard also learned how she was sitting opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s eyes crossed Richard, I don’t know where to go, she was silent, and Richard was silent, not disturbing her thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Vatican sighed and sighed, and took back her thoughts. She regained her anger and look in her eyes. She looked at Li. Inspecting, the gaze of the moment penetrated Richard, and Richard suddenly slammed into a chill. It seems that all the secrets were understood by Vatican, and they did not feel stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three time hourglasses in the depths of Vatican’s eyes disappeared slowly, and their eyes no longer have the insightful power to make Lee fear. She looked at Richard, her eyes. There is a clear appreciation in it, saying: "You have gained a lot in the field of the absolute field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just going on as planned." Richard said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still ready to stay in the big magician for a few years." Vatican asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question, Richard has long been wondering how long he thought, and immediately said: "At least four years, it may be longer, now I am I can only think of so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For four years, it seems to be longer than I thought. I thought it would be enough for three years." While saying, while waving, the hall has a little time in the air, condensed into a set of tea sets, not to see the Vatican tea, but to pick up the teapot and pour it out, naturally from the spout, pour a cup of tea, tea The fragrance filled the hall in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline pushed a cup of tea to Richard, and he picked up another cup of shallow drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a sip of tea and immediately squirted a sigh of gas, praising: "Good tea." Then he sorted out the ideas, to Vatican Say: "Normally, three years is really enough, but I am not a person who can put everything down and go on the road of the strong. I still have a lot of responsibilities. I need to take care of the territory and develop the plane. And to enhance the strength of followers, in addition, there are many commitments to complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin nodded and asked: "You are in the field I have seen Philip in the battlefield. How is he doing now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty." Richard smiled and said: "The next step is to recover the rising sun. The battle of that level is far beyond my ability. How can I get involved? I have never been to the sun, I have never seen him, I have not heard it for a while. The news of His Majesty, I don’t know if he is still stationed in the rising sun, or go to other places, wait for me. When you are on the battlefield, you will find a way to inquire about your message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I only need to know his status every other time, no need to inquire "Van Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Vatican, but saw her cloudless, faint, not like angry or worried about Philip, I don't feel a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin looked at Richard’s expression and couldn’t help but smile: “Bad boy, what he is thinking about.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was thinking, the risk of taking the risk is not small, why don't you help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed and said: "I can't Leaving this eternal dragon temple, unless the eternal and time dragon finds another god who can replace me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sand sand." When the name came out, the voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calmed down and opened his mouth, as if he wanted to ask, but did not speak, but put all the questions in his heart, Van Gogh Lin looked at her eyes and flashed a line of emotion, and sighed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too much like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Liusha, almost exactly the same as Philip and Vatican in the past, the way of doing things, the road they take is very similar, they are actually Unconsciously walking on the old roads of Philip and Vatican, Richard and quicksand are too smart and think too much. They always think about whether they can do more for each other, but forget to ask if this is The other party wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young, I always wanted to think carefully, but I didn’t know that it was just a matter of concern. Instead, I pushed away from each other. However, this is youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline finally decided to push them again, and said: "Now this is not a problem for the time being, I still don't want to leave this temple, so you still have Sufficient time together, talk more, fight together, sand is a good helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha carefully scrutinizes Vatican’s words, I finally understood some of the meanings, and asked: "His Royal Vatican, if you leave the temple, where will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to a world without light Where is it, I can't say it, just want to say it, but I can't say it. If we stay tired in the temple, we can choose to go to that place. Then, the new gods need to take over the dragon temple. "Van Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline’s voice was soft and pleasant, but Richard heard the chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
