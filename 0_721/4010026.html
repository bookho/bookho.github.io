What Li said before she left, the cold eyes when she saw her, were still deeply imprinted in her heart, as clear as it happened yesterday. She is scared and very scared. She did not know if it would cross the bottom line and what would happen if it was discovered by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coco! I know what you are worried about, are you worried about Richard?" Young people are getting more and more excited, and they say: "Lee counts What? What is great about him? Isn't there a good father? I don't know if he is a hybrid of Gordon and a wild woman. How have you never heard of him in the past ten years? He has a good time. The father of the Marquis, so there is a sacrifice, can go to the eternal dragon temple to sacrifice. Otherwise, what kind of builder will he become? Still a level 10 magician, this aristocrat-born magician, I can cut a sword Dead! He has been on the floating island for so long, how has he never made a structure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Richard him... "Coco once worked as an assistant to Richard, and also had some common sense of magic. Although I can't see the potential of Richard's accomplishment in the construction, it is not what young people say." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cocoa, stay with me!" The young man did not hear Coco's weak rebuttal. He was completely immersed in his own thoughts and said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool night wind blew through and let Cocoa fight a little chill. She always remembers the consequences of being known by Richard, so she took a step back and said softly: "Irvine, no. I am already a partner chosen by Richard. It can't be like this. We can't fight against the family." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or like this, we are secretly together, you give birth to one of our children!" Young step-fighting knight Elvin retired and offered another Suggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco seriously thought about it and suddenly remembered another thing, so he shook his head and said, "No! He...he hasn’t touched me yet...so, if we That way, he will definitely be discovered by him! Otherwise, wait for the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erwen screamed, surprised and happy, clutching cocoa Q: "Have he really touched you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The pressure on the shoulder suddenly increased, and the cocoa pre-feeled and began to tremble. Looking at Elvin’s eyes, there was also fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coco! Let me give it to you!" Elf slammed up and took Cocoa into his arms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Richard will kill us!!" Coco struggled hard and the sound improved by eight degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irvine is deaf to the ear, the hands are getting more and more intense, and the breathing is more rapid. As soon as he came into contact with Coco's young, energetic and flexible body, he was completely ignited and could not attend the consequences. Anyway, Irvine’s last name is not Archimonde. It belongs to a certain in-law family of the collateral. Strictly speaking, even the vassal is not. Now he has the potential to build a knight, and which family can get a good one. position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa is just a second-level illusionist. It’s not much stronger than the average girl. It’s not an opponent of Irvine. When he struggles, he is pressed by him. On the open space. And her dress can't stop Elvin's powerful hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
