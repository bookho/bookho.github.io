Then I think about my own problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided by the Brood, when it is promoted to the 10th order, it may awaken its real name like the ontology. If it is not awakened, then the 11th level Can wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard thinks this is very strange. According to common sense, the body and the avatar of the mother's nest should share the same soul. The real name is a reflection of the power of the soul. How can one wake up a real name? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not the place where Richard needs to worry. If they each have a soul, it is a good thing. In the hands of Richard, there are two mother nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as long as there is enough time, there will be a jīng dark night in the Greenson plane, and its level has been directly chasing the mother. The frosty warrior and the arrow beast of the nest body. When the mother's nest is promoted to the tenth order, the created jīng English night jīng spirit can reach the seventeenth level, which is equivalent to the Shenli cold cream warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading such an army, Richard even has the confidence to sweep the old tyrants of the three empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the army of Richard, it can be roughly divided into three major blocks: the Brood Warrior, the Archimonde Warrior and the Foreign Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat power from the two nests is gradually occupying the core plane, and the growth of Archimonde warriors has begun to slow down. In the past few years, Richard has recruited almost all Archimonde soldiers who are willing to join the army. So now, he has to focus on the recruitment of soldiers outside of Akmon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 50,000 non-Arqmond fighters currently recruited, and five regular legions have been formed. And all Archimonde warriors are only 70,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as another core of Richard’s fighting power, the knight is always growing at a high speed. Richard spent a lot of money, recruiting candidates for the knights, and using the magic contract as a carrier to ensure loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Richard's Knight's construction is more optimized for carrying capacity, the range that the bearer can choose from is virtually expanded. Now he has more than 2,000 candidate knights. It is a tyrannical force to pull these people out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the ancestor ontology, its current growth has reached the bottleneck, and the promotion of the 12th level also requires a lot of gods, but the ability to create combat units has been rushed. On, it is a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the parent nest has its own advantages, that is, its creation system is much more complicated. Whether it is a star, a flying dragonfly, or a flesh furnace, it is not available in the mother's nest. The ancestor itself forms a self-sufficient war system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An army cannot be a warrior, so if the mother's nest body and the avatar are decisive, the loser will definitely be a avatar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not the case for Richard. If the mother's nest is missing, he can make up. Moreover, compared with the combat units such as Frost Warrior and Arrow Beast, the comprehensive combat power of the dark night jīng spirit is obviously stronger, and the price ratio is higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts for a whole night, Richard finally decided to focus on the resources of the dark night. Then, the next step is to determine the standard equipment of the dark night and the supporting material logistics system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the design of magic weapons, obviously deep blue has an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, millions of gold coins under Richard’s have already achieved fruitful results. The dark blue masters now have the concept of price ratio, knowing how to maximize the cost of controlling the cost, rather than romantically chasing the pure power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the idiots who know that inlaid a dragon with a dragon will become a legendary weapon, but Richard can’t match his own soldiers. Upload odd weapons. In fact, even followers are not available with legendary equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard gives the upper limit of the enchantment level of the standard equipment is the jīng level under the epic. This is also the highest enchantment equipment that can be mass produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expected plan, Richard immediately painted the image of the dark night jīng spirit warrior, shè hand and Druid on the magic paper, and attached the relevant data. These data will be used as the basis for equipment design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard thought about it and added a jīng spiritual master. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although now due to insufficient data, the nest can not create a mage, but there is a wealth of magical material in the nest body, which is enough to support the creation of a spell. Fighting unit. Even the wizards created in this way have only a few magics available, more like those who are born with magical genius. However, for Richard, this is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard’s request for jīng’s Master is even lower. Thunder, acid rain, and poisonous fog are all unnecessary, as long as they can fire the ball. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Richard himself, it’s all the way to the legendary fireball. It’s just that the fireball has changed a little, from small to large, from small to large, from red to blue. But how can they change, they are still fireballs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared for this, Richard came to the ultra-remote communication magic array and started communication with Deep Blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, black gold appeared in front of the communication magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the gray dwarf today is very weird, the eyes are black, the hair and beard are sparse, and there is a large piece of scorch on the tip of the nose, it looks like Just fled from the volcanic eruption to the same day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the teacher there?" This is the first question of Richard's routine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness left some time ago, and it is said that he was looking for food with a legendary mage in the depths of his face. Recently, His Royal Highness’s appetite is very good, and the amount of food is turned over. Not to mention three times, the consumption of fruit snacks after meals has also tripled." The gray dwarf said that he danced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Deep Blue, the more the legendary Master can eat, the more happy everyone is. Everyone knows the eternal law of Su Hailun, and the amount of rice determines the combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also smiled and asked: "Oh, what good news has you told me recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold suddenly put on a mysterious expression, and lowered the voice and said: "Kid, you asked right this time! Remember the last time I told you, will you give you a big surprise? Now You can see it right away! But before that, I have to remind you one thing: you have to make sure that there are enough gold coins in your pocket!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Richard has never seen the gray dwarf like this. Black gold is never exaggerated. Since he is so sure, this surprise must be huge enough, so that Richard can not hesitate to put a lot of gold coins out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I am coming now?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! Why not?" The Grey Dwarf said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Richard to Dark Blue, the cost of a one-way trip is 100,000 gold coins. Gray dwarves who have a very high concept of gold coins cannot ignore such a significant cost. It can be seen that this surprise is definitely enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard immediately activated the ultra-long-range transmission matrix. After a while, he went to dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold led Richard directly to the magical test ground in the dark blue underground. Black gold has brought a whole row of humanoid targets. The strength of these humanoid target simulations begins with the ten-level knights, and continues to the seventeen-level knights, each level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanoid experimental target was placed 30 meters away, which is the usual distance for magic experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few masters pushed a mobile cart, but the cart was covered with a black cloth, and there was nothing hidden underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold’s sound is heard in the Magic Lab: “Kid! You will see a great miracle soon! From then on, those damn dragon blood The gnomes saw me and respectfully praised the black gold master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the gray dwarf jumped up and slammed the cart Black cloth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw something as bizarre. It is thick and heavy, and it is nearly two meters long. If it is placed upright, it will far exceed the height of the gray dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that this thing is used horizontally, and Black Gold will not find this kind of trouble for himself. The Grey Dwarf is indeed a bit taller than the Alpine Dwarf, but it is not as high as humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is somewhat similar to the dwarf's musket, but the difference is that it has six barrels. At the end of the barrel, it is not the divergent opening of the dwarf musket, but the straight nozzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the back of it there is a thick grip and trigger, indicating that most of this is still in the scope of the musket, but Richard is very skeptical that it can be used like a musket. After all, the six large barrels together add up to 60 kilograms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the rear of the barrel, exposed piles of gears and complex lines also indicate that this thing is not as simple as a normal dwarf musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will see a fireworks feast! Kid!" The gray dwarf was as excited as drinking a bucket of spirits and grabbing the cart. Bizarre musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard understands what the handle in the middle of the gun is for, and the original position is where it is. The gray dwarf's right hand hangs down, naturally grabbing the grip and holding the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing was originally used at the waist position... Richard is thinking about this strange use posture, Black Gold has already pulled the trigger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the muzzle squirted a few meters of fire tongue, and the magic lab sounded like a thunder, and everything shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far-reaching representative of the humanoid target of the knight is suddenly sunken, with several hot-deformed metal bombs embedded in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is huge, it can hurt the knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the Knight is armed with a shield, this gun is not enough. At most, the arm of the knight is numb, and it is not able to blast the shield. degree. In an instant, Richard made an accurate judgment on the power of this strange musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is just the beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gear on the rifle suddenly rotates rapidly, giving a karaoke sound, the gear drives the six barrels to start rotating, and one of the barrels on the side rotates When I reached the center position, I also blew a long flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the roar, the barrel continues to rotate at a rapid speed, and a fire tongue is ejected from the barrel, almost in one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
