And you promised, you have to do it... this character, how do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Someone has already boasted that I am smart!" Richard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is so shameless?" Vatican asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "White night!" Richard looked innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Night?! She?" Vatican lost her voice. When she thought about it, she suddenly smiled and licked her lips with a strange expression. She said slowly: "The character of the white night is definitely not to be stupid, or to start playing directly. If she says that you are smart, it is estimated that it is hateful. Can't help but knock your head! Let me see, I guess right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the eyes of Vatican began to circulate the dark golden light, Richard immediately screamed badly and subconsciously wanted to hold his head. It was really unspeakable to be swayed by the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin was a glimpse first, then his face was weird, as if he was enduring hard, and finally he couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard’s face changes, his face is remorseful, he is deeply blamed, and he should not play any tricks in front of the eternal and timeless dragon. The power of retrospection of time is indeed a hateful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Vatican to laugh enough, then put away the form of arrogance, turn to dignified elegance, cover the mouth with his hand, and bend his eyebrows: "Long time no I laughed so happily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only had to say "I am honored!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Van Lin put away a smile, and said: "Well, let me talk about what I want to ask you. It is about drifting sand. She was abandoned at the entrance of the Eternal Dragon Hall. In fact, every year. There are many abandoned babies placed at the entrance of the Eternal Dragon Hall, but the Eternal Dragon Temple is not based on kindness, so these abandoned babies will be sent to ordinary people for adoption, and their fate will not be related to the Eternal Dragon Hall. Flowing sand, when I saw her at first sight, I liked the stubbornness of her little face. This...may be the traction in time. Later, I just watched her grow up, become a pastor, become a priest, In the end, she became a god. Her personality is very similar to me. Looking at her, I am like seeing myself when I was young. But now, she is embarking on me. The road, which makes me very worried "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". I need to how to do, "Richard saw the Vatican Lin dignified, so he asked?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin thought about it and said, "Promise me, let her keep hope forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There is a saying that even if Vanine does not say, Richard can guess. If the sand lost hope, it will go the same way as Vatican. And Richard now knows that Vatican is calm, but not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns: "How can I make her hope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin said: "This is something you should think about, I can't teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make her hope? Richard thought to himself, he felt that when it was time, there would be an answer. Just like he suddenly wanted to go to Calando and wanted to see the mountains and the sea. Not only does it want to see her, but it is because the five years are too long, and the long wait for no information is a torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard gradually understood that as long as he had the heart, he would always know how to give her hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's talk about this sacrifice. What kind of sacrifices have you prepared, what kind of gods do you want?" Vatican said lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said: "This time the sacrifice is more than expected. I originally prepared two artifacts from the Faro plane. There may still be a glimpse of the gods in the face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it should be enough for advanced ceremonies."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I just got another batch of sacrifices, so there are two more top sacrifices in this sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin’s eyes brightened and said: “It’s very capable! Did you bring her family out to you in the night?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a glance, it seems that nothing can be overwhelmed by this great priest. Moreover, Vatican seems to have an extraordinarily understanding of the white night, but it seems to have vague hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get the time for the sacrifice. The Vatican’s great priest was let go of Richard and did not continue to ask the relationship between Richard and White Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice ceremony began on time, and Vatican personally sent Richard to the core of the Eternal Dragon Hall. The sacrifice was very heavy, and the box left by the white night was even more difficult to carry on with Richard. Vatican looked at it and took it with him. He took the box off the back of Richard and slid it in his hand. It seems that there is no weight at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snacks were shocked, this box is close to ten tons, he has to use all his strength to be able to carry it back, but also have to use some magical armed forces. However, Vatican walked away and looked at the relaxed look. Her strength might not be under the Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is still like a ruin. Vatican puts the sacrificial box on the side of the altar, then nods to Richard and retreats beyond the altar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha skillfully started the sacrificial ceremony. After a while, the power of time came from the void, forming a golden light curtain, and the whole altar was Surrounded. Richard now knows that at this moment, the altar is actually in another time and space, and because of the double barrier between time and space, apart from the sand and Vatican, the god of eternal and timeless dragons, no one else can influence The process of sacrifice. However, a large priest such as Nolan has the ability to make the grace of the sacrificer slightly tilted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first put a simple axe of a traditional axe on the altar. If there is a person in the Faro Baroque Kingdom, it is possible to recognize this. Tomahawk is one of the three artifacts of God of War! When Zong Zonghu was besieged by many great mages and sacred sects, he was seriously injured and fled. The three gods of the God of War also lost two pieces, all falling into the hands of Raymond. With the destruction of Raymond, the two artifacts naturally came to Richard. Although the Faro artifact is not comparable to Norland's standard artifacts, it is still a little stronger than Norwood's legendary equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, according to the standard procedure of sacrifice, Richard was meditation on the hope of the grace: the coordinates of the plane. He believes that he is now qualified to fight across the plane and can work hard to find the whereabouts of the man. Suddenly, Richard faintly felt the power of time passing over his body, gently touching his own soul, and then fluttering out, condensing with the power of time falling in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
