			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the normal cost, the smallest castle can be built with seven or eight thousand gold coins Richard has extra requirements for defense, so the cost will exceed 20,000. There is also a need to rebuild the road, which is also a small expense. But in any case, the pre-project, five thousand gold coins are absolutely enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, the Knights are respectfully saluting, but this time the aristocratic etiquette can not make the mood of Richard better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here? Why is this only working? You are going to rely on this person and put the castle on me little by little." Hey, Pierce, where did he go?" Richard's voice became more and more severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already a cold sweat in the forehead of the Knights. He found that this young and gentle-looking young master, once angry, had a heart-warming majesty. "General Richard, you started telling me and Pierce to hire a craftsman to hire the stone and wood from the Baron Fontaine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Nod, then saw the face of the Knight, the brow wrinkled, sneered and asked: "Why, the gold coins for you are not enough, things can not be bought, people can not hire?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights said with a smile: "The gold coins you gave are reasonable enough. But now, it is really something that can't be bought, and people can't hire it. The new Baron Fontaine puts all the building materials. The price has increased tenfold, and the salary of the hired worker has also increased tenfold. At this price, we simply don't dare to make the decision. We can only decide when you return from the Duke territory."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked slightly surprised and said: "So, it is the Baron Xiaofang Dan who did not want to sell it to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Knight said cautiously: "We think so too, but this is what you are told by the adults, so we must continue anyway. So, now Pierce still stays in the Little Baron Castle, and I come back one step ahead and collect the first hand. But you also see that there are only so many people, the materials can only be taken locally, that is, manufacturing."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said nothing, but slowly patrolled the site and said slowly: "It seems that some people do not want I built the castle in this place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, then we are now...." The knight was carefully asked. The time he followed Richard was not too short, but he felt more and more that he could not see the young great magician. Until now, as long as Richard’s face is up, he will be inexplicably afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You continue to manage things on the construction site, don't stop the construction of the castle. I will go to the dusk castle in person tomorrow." After that, Richard returned. In the second floor of the camp, which was built for himself, a copy of the map obtained from the Duke was opened, and compared with the list of the surrounding nobles provided by the Duke, while thinking and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the door was gently ringed and the sand came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a day's journey, why not take a break?" Richard smiled and put down his roster, and reached out and took the flow of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamer snorted and slammed it on Richard’s hand and said, “First talk about business!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s hand hurts, but he didn’t let go, but he didn’t move any more. He said, “Well, let's talk, what is the right thing? After we have finished the business, we still have something to do!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand was furious, and he took a bite on Richard’s shoulder and then gnashed his teeth and said, “If you have no day and night, you are not afraid of the magic downgrade!!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahaha smiled and said, "How come? When the business is doing, the magic is surging, just to understand the truth of many magic and decoration!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! It’s getting more and more serious, isn’t you a big magician like this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Richard's cheeks gradually thickened: "According to Noland's standard, I can still be far from the great magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noland, the smile on her face suddenly disappeared. She sighed and straightened her body. She said to Richard: "Do you have any thoughts about returning to Noland?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way, but there are a lot of ideas." Richard released the hand that took the sand and pulled her to the map. He smiled and said, "We are actually It is already open to the situation. The next thing that needs to be done is to increase the strength and increase the possibility of survival. The path is nothing more than resources and war. As long as there are channels for selling the structure, we will continue to flow in gold coins. Wealth can be exchanged. Magic materials, slaves, territories, and even mercenary groups can also carry out some normal trades. Now that I have played so many games, on a small battlefield of about a thousand people, as long as the strengths are not too different, I will surely defeat As long as you can continue to defeat the enemy, you can get the two materials we need most now, the magic crystal and the ancestor worship the totem altar. With them, the mother nest will continue to grow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard used his hand on the blood-stained land to say a little bit, saying: "Without three years, we can control this land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &n Bsp; Liu Sha looked at Richard's side face and found that he did not know from what time, gradually becoming confident and decisive, and began to take responsibility. She sighed in her heart and put her eyes on the map, saying: "The ancestor worships the totem, but it is not as good as the temple statue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I was taken aback and said with some hesitation: "That is equivalent to open war with the true God. Even if we can, at least we have to wait until we get through the passage back to Noland. Only when we return to Noland, can we resist. The power of the legendary powerhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe going back is not as difficult as you think!" The sand drifted gently to Richard's face and said slowly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard was really shocked and looked up and said, "What? Can we go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not so easy!" The sand drifted a small fist and slammed on Licha’s head before saying, "We can’t go back, mainly because we lost the promise in the Faro plane. The coordinates of Rand. Our own power is not strong enough to be spatially oriented. But when we painted the impossible time for the Duke of Biele, it suddenly made me think that it was not completely impossible. Realize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Just build an altar to sacrifice to the Eternal and Time Dragon?" Richard was taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is not so good, he glanced at him and stunned him. He said, "Of course it is not an altar. The dragon of eternal and timeless has not made an imprint. It's useless. But the book of Time in my hand can be connected to the dragon of eternal and time, we can try to get the coordinates of Noland directly from it. Now in the Faro plane, we also know The location of the two time lighthouses, by removing their materials, can rebuild a time lighthouse, which is the basis for returning to the Nolander Portal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
