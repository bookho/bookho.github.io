Richard asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anything that wants to achieve through the Eternal and the Dragon of Time requires a sacrifice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice..." Richard’s face also changed. He has personally experienced the sacrificial rites, and of course knows what level of sacrifice is required to cause the attention of the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sacrifices! The old dragon does not need faith, only sacrifices! It pursues the principle of eternal exchange of equivalence." Hate said. She grew up in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, and of course knew what kind of sacrifice she needed to return to Noland. To put it simply, a big devil head full of strength is almost the same. If such a skull passes through the hand of sand drifting, most of them can exchange for two years of life rapids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you think about it, it’s only twenty years. In the longan of eternity and time, it is not only this time to scrape powder from any dragon scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard immediately relaxed, took a sigh of relief, grabbed a hand on the sand butt, and said with a smile: "A small fan! It’s good to find the way to go back. It’s too expensive. In other words, even if you need a sacrifice, it’s not necessarily done by us. It can be done by other means, such as constructing exchange. We don’t do it now. Let the Duke of the Wolf help us to make sacrifices? Here is Faro, only a few thousand years behind Noord. The power of a duke must not be underestimated."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 流沙 argues: "This is an indirect method, indirect! That is to say, the previous sacrifices must first be used to strengthen the book of my time, to strengthen the communication with the eternal and the dragon of time. Ability, then you can replace the Eternal Dragon Temple with the Book of Time, and sacrifice to the Eternal and Time Dragon. Although the Book of Time is an artifact, but can not be compared with the real Eternal Dragon Temple, so through the sacrifice of the book of time, the income The grace of God will be much less, very About two-thirds less!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Anyway, since there is already a way, then don't feel expensive, anyway, we don't need to go in person." Get it." Said, Richard's hand began to touch down the sand ass, then grabbed the hem of the robes of the gods, began to lift up, put on a frame to prepare 'do business'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowing sand reluctantly sighed, no longer entangled in this issue. She is only very uncomfortable, the same sacrifice, if the eternal dragon temple in the floating world can be exchanged for 30 years of grace, then the book of the time passed can only be exchanged for ten years. In fact, it is very difficult to change to a decade of grace. The difference between being and not being is essential. As long as you can get the grace through sacrifice, you can say that they have laid a very solid foundation stone in the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, what else can you complain about? After Richard’s hustle and bustle, the feeling of quicksand has been a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held down the hand of Richard’s robbing under the robes and said, “I haven’t finished it yet! I just tested it for Siss. He has a very talented sorcerer's talent. In the special case, he can consider quickly raising his level. I need several powerful assistants. In addition, my magic scroll is almost running out, I have to consider Get a batch, do we find another temple to grab it? Finally, it is your own strength, you need to make another build for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
