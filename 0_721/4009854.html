			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, a huge bright moon rises in the sky, shining the whole In the land of blood, the stars have become the embellishment on the set. It seems that even the night sky here is different from the other side of the turbulent land. Under the moonlight of mercury, many weathered stone pillars are also emitting a faint glow. Through the night, Richard led the crowd to set off and joined the advance team in the early hours of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Richard saw was a team of soldiers, everyone was wounded, all the horses were lost, and the original soldiers were now only alive. Two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the quicksand was busy treating the wounded soldiers of the advance team, Richard gloomy face, walked around them, and wounded everyone’s injuries. Looked at it, and then said to the headed knight, "Who did it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said to be the red Cossacks, they are interested in carrying us The horses of the horse said that they wanted to buy at the price of one gold coin. This is only one percent of the market price. I refused, and they immediately turned their faces. There are more than two hundred people, including about ten knights. The strength is much stronger than us, so in the end only escaped so many people." Step Knight said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge wound on the back of the knight, almost revealing the bones. When I first saw Richard, the wound was still flowing out of pus. In addition to this wound, there are more than a dozen large and small wounds on his body, which shows that the battle of the day was fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Cossack..." Richard repeatedly read the name several times, his face deeper and deeper, then asked: "Those who attacked you, see you later." Did you still recognize it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can definitely recognize it! The head is a knight with at least 13th grade. He wears a red heavy armor. With a saw blade, it is very easy to recognize!" said the step knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and forth, waiting for the sand to handle all the injuries, he stopped, patted the knight’s shoulder and sighed and said: "This is a good job, because you are all alive and come back. If the horse is lost, you can get it back. If you die, can I find someone who can be trusted like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard is finding out that the value of these knights that Gordon gave him is almost impossible to measure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Steps showed a grateful color, struggling with a meticulous military ceremony, and said: "For the Gotton adults and Archimonde, it was originally The purpose of our life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Richard in the target of the Cavaliers, but only Gordon and Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed this, but said nothing, and the people around who heard it also took it for granted. This is the cohesiveness of the family and a legendary leader. The object of their allegiance was formerly Gordon, now Richard, and may be the son of Richard in the future. Either one is a member of Archimonde in the eyes of these knights. Gordon was raised separately because his contribution to the Archimonde family was large enough to be included in history, comparable to the most outstanding Archimonde in history. Perhaps in a few decades, Gordon’s merits will surpass all ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the knights of the battle are all made for Archimonde, and Archimonde provides them with education, training, social status, wealth and a Channels leading to higher positions, if they are strong enough, they will be even more affected by blood, relatives, and even teams. The two sides are like holly and fir trees, intertwined and support each other. This is also the way to survive the many nobles of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
