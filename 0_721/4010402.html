			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the terrain on both sides of the strait, Richard led the followers back to the two sides. The place, the bridge of the mainland, the so-called bridge of the mainland, is actually a section of the central part of the valley of the gods, where the bottom of the rift suddenly rises, less than a hundred meters away from the two sides, and has a gentle slope, overlooking it. A giant bridge a kilometer wide was built on the rift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this was the only passage for north-south traffic, and it was called the bridge of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bridge of the mainland, which is several kilometers long and about a kilometer wide, the two sides launched an extremely fierce battle. Every inch of land was repeatedly watered by blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon has repeatedly made breakthroughs, always being stopped by the local soldiers of Shulan with flesh and blood, and finally Gotton consumed all the power and had to Staying on the bridge of the mainland, the two sides have built a dense line of defense from the bridge, and the two ends of the bridge have become a fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, in order to consolidate the line of defense, the two sides continued to move the fortifications until they were separated by a kilometer. The middle kilometer zone has already become a dead zone. I don't know how many soldiers are here, their blood will be dyed dark brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood at the highest point of the fortress, looked at the top of the tower, and looked at the other side. From this perspective, the first half of the Shulan fortifications Can be seen clearly, can indeed be said to the point of impregnation, in a small area, stacked thousands of defensive warriors, and the fortifications have obviously passed the special design of defensive magic, the magic of the big magician has a large range of magic Quite the resistance, the Shulans are very smart and very cautious. They built a wall at the opposite commanding height. This wall not only blocked Richard’s sight, but even Richard’s fortification in the front area. The fortifications were all attacked, and only under the wall, they will face a difficult siege war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the defensive layout of both sides, Richard has already knowed what he is doing. He walked into the commanding castle. At this time, a precise magic map has been set up in the battle hall. Several mages are constantly importing the latest data into the map, so the terrain of the bridge of the Shulan continent has become more precise and clear. The magic map is extremely accurate and detachable. It can be carried along with the army. It is also a dragon. The finest of the bloody gnomes of the same kind of products, each Nolande giants have to have at least one or two to show the military professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a thing, although it is only a mass-produced product, but also a few hundred thousand gold coins, in the past, Gotton is naturally untenable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the magic map and meditated. At this time, Oral came in and reported that the army’s reorganization had been completed, and the terrain was explored in Richard. At that time, Oral stayed in the fortress of the mainland to reorganize the army. He has been following Richard for a long time, knowing how to reorganize to meet Richard's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and called Senma into the war room and reached out to the forefront of the fortress. He said: "Reload the one or two regiments to move forward. Entering the attack position, the light infantry will follow, and the fortress garrison will enter the position. All the dispatch will be completed before dusk tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma slightly surprised Q: "Would you want to attack the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao shook his head and said, "No, wait for them to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for the Shulans to call." Senma is even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they don't come, then we will fight, and you will know when you get there." Richard reached out and represented several legions on the magic map. The flag moves forward, which is equivalent to letting two-thirds of the troops in the fortress enter the attack position. Obviously, this will be a situation of attacking, but the attack is completely hard, even if it breaks through the defense of the Shulan. The loss must also be extremely heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arrangement of the troops was transferred, Richard picked up the knife and carried it behind him. He said, "Go, let's go to the front line and give the Shulans a slap in the face." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma can be said to be behind a sneak peek at the front of the fortress. Richard only brought followers and a group of local recruits. The warrior went up to the city wall and looked at the opposite side. On the wall of the fortress of the Shulan people, there were a lot of beautifully dressed guys. It was obviously disturbed by the movements of the troops here. There was no shortage of force in the Shulan people. The strong, more people are staring at Richard and watching, and his eyes are not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and turned his head to the ogre: "Tiramisu, try to find out what kind of strong people are in the Shulan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre opened two big mouths and smiled and said: "Reassure, head, I promise to give them all."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's learn swearing with them and read more books." Richard was helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am reading, I only know how to eat when I am three-pointed." One of the ogre's heads immediately screamed, and the other one with one eye If you don't show weakness, you immediately retort: ​​"If I didn't eat it hard, we can grow so big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the head said, read." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your book has been read for three months, not on that page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the two heads of each other, Tiramisu jumped directly from the fifteen-meter-high wall. When it landed, it shook the earth. He dragged his hands and hammers and draped thickly. The man is silent and takes a big step. He walks straight to the center of the two fronts and screams in the sound of Shuran in a thunderous voice: "My name is Tiramisu, the coward of Shulan, who dares to come down with me." "A dead battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the ogre is rolling away, rumbling in the rift, bringing back countless echoes, for a time, it seems Heaven and earth Ogre roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in the middle of the bridge of the mainland, the ogre's momentum is constantly rising, quickly breaking through the limit, and even seeing a green and red gas column It was rising from the top of his two heads. For a time, everyone on the Shulan side was discolored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu is the first of many of Richard’s followers to break into the sanctuary. When the two-headed ogres break through, it’s not good to say that the soldiers are still big. The Magister, more like a mixture of the two, the great advantage of the race allows the ogre to almost touch the ordinary human sanctuary or the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Shulan people no one to end, Tiramisu is another roar: "Hughan's coward, who dares to fight with me," /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a blatant clamor and provocation, and the Shulan people are a commotion. The soldiers in the fortress have a lot of shyness and sentiment, and morale is rapidly declining. At the back of the bridge of the mainland, there are indeed legendary strong people in the town, but the legendary strong can not easily move, let alone mention that tiramisu is just a sanctuary, the legendary strong is the winner is also a shame, is the legendary strong Ken pulled his face down and didn't dare to appear in the middle of the bridge in the mainland. There are only two legendary strongmen in Shulan. One of them was seriously injured in the battle with Gordon and the knights. He almost lost his life and suffered injuries. Unhealed, the remaining legendary powerhouse has become the only remaining pillar of the North, saying nothing can happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ogre was called to the third time, the Shulans finally couldn't stand it. A burly man jumped from the wall and strode to Tiramisu. He had the light green color of the Shulan natives. More than two meters five, in the normal person is the burly pole, but compared with tiramisu, but not the chest of the ogre, this big man carrying a stunning huge two-handed sword, but from the footsteps Look, the speed is certainly not slow, it is the strong force of both strength and agility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing an opponent's end, Tiramisu laughed a few times and retreated a large distance, giving room for the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan stepped into the battlefield, holding a sword with both hands, and the momentum rose. He stared at Tiramisu and said, "Who are you, I am Hugh." The Lan Empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu has a big hand and interrupted the words of the big man: "Don’t waste time, if you don’t die after the fight, then Besides, the name is not too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a twist on his face, and he screamed, stepping forward, and the giant sword stabbed straight toward the belly of Tiramisu. However, the Jianfeng was only halfway through. The big man suddenly slipped at the foot, and the whole person shook ten meters in a strange way. The blade front had turned from the belly to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu smiled and stared at the direction of the original Han, and it seemed that there was no reaction at all. The big man was actually very fast, and the giant sword flashed. The squad has been stabbed with the heavy armor of Tiramisu. The ogre armor instantly illuminates a layer of cyan ray, and the giant sword is immediately one of the most stunned, the big man is shocked, the arrogance is raging, the giant sword Was not touched by the magic defense, stabbed the ogre's waist ribs, the sword front did not enter the heavy armor, and immediately made a squeaking sound, every one centimeter was extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive power of the Ogre's heavy armor is obviously beyond his expectation. Such a defensive power is only available in the armor of the Imperial Family of the Hughland Empire. The strongest of the era, even the equipment of the Shulans can not match, and now actually jump out of an ogre, is a legendary level of equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then unexpectedly, not only this thing, Tiramisu’s electro-optic beating, the action suddenly accelerated, and the chilling hands of the giant hammer The sound of a round, instantly reached the top of the big man, the big man was horrified, at this time dodge is no longer enough, can only block the cross sword in the midst of a thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer and sword intersect, there is no gold and iron crossfire, only a thunderous roar, far away, the big man fluttering, is already double Kneeling, knees sinking into the ground, his arms can still support the giant sword, but the sword of the giant sword is under pressure, is bending out a clear arc, the sword is full of light, it is the enchantment effect The flag that was constantly destroyed, obviously this great sword of good quality was smashed by Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
