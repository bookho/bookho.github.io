			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is not large, but it is enough to pass in the quiet corridor. It is far away. After a few doors, the girl was disappointed and disguised, and there was a muffled noise from the stairs, as if there was any heavy object falling into the ground. The cocoa face was as white as paper, and the small mouth opened and closed, but did not make any sound. She stayed in the same place for a while, but Richard and the butler did not seem to find her abnormality, and no one urged her. Finally, Cocoa lowered his head and returned to the room, waiting for Richard to come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was closed behind Richard, and the housekeeper who closed the door reminded him to go tonight for a little rest, not to overdo it. Work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms in Cocoa are small, just over ten square meters. A small bed, a cupboard, plus a table and chairs are a bit crowded. But the small room was clean and spotless, and there was a diary on the desk next to the ink bottle with the feather pen. On the window sill is a pot of bluegrass that exudes a burst of fragrance around the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no extra decoration here, clean and warm, just like the room of any human ordinary country gentleman daughter on the mainland. On a floating island with lava volcanic scent everywhere, this room is like a fresh and elegant white flower on the volcanic foot. It sways in the wind and can be destroyed at any time. The style of the room is exactly the same as cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa stood by the door and twisted the nightdress with both hands. Although the low head does not see the expression, but these little movements have revealed her extreme nervousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the environment in the room, Richard went to the front of Coco, reached out to understand her light brown long hair, and then put on her face. Lift her low head so she can look at her eyes. When the skin touched the finger, Coco immediately trembled strongly. She wants to bow her head, but Richard's hand is stable and powerful, letting her understand that this is a request that cannot be refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa looked up, his eyes filled with despair and fear, and the tears had already filled, but there was no overflow. She suddenly had a chill, then hugged her hands with her hands, as if shaking slightly in the cold. She did feel the cold, because Richard's hand was very cold, and his eyes were colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to you in this building, senior professional servants and guards officers..." Richard said here, intentionally paused before continuing to say: " ...and the young reserve warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa shuddered again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not continue on this topic, and let go of his hand, let her head hang down again, then slowly and toughly ring her in the chest The front hand was opened, and the shawl fell to the ground, revealing the robes under the robe covering the undulating chest. Cocoa's skin is delicate and white, and the rim of the faint lining can be seen through the neckline of the nightdress. The full chest is not as proud as the 黛 ,, but it is just right on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of Richard touched the neck of Cocoa and made her tremble again. However, Richard did not pay attention to her faint resistance, but slowly slid down the white skin, sliding all the way to the chest. His fingertips touched the neckline of the nightdress, did not stop, continued to go down, so the cocoa nightdress was pulled down gradually, gradually revealing two groups of white and full of milk. As soon as the red line in the first line was also hidden from the edge of the neckline of the sleeping skirt, Richard’s hand finally stopped, but did not withdraw, but stayed at this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of cocoa has already jumped very fast, but she is desperately controlling her breathing. As long as the movement is slightly larger, her chest will completely jump out of the nightdress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard’s devilish voice rang in her ear: “Akmund’s woman needs to remain pure before being appointed. Did you do that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa was stiff like a statue, and it was hard to see her gently nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and his fingertips slid gently on her bare breasts and said slowly: "Is it? But I am not very Believe in you, come and prove it to me now, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Coco suddenly relaxed the collapsed body, and his hands fell in two Side, gave up all resistance and protection. Resisting is of no use. From the day she arrived at the floating island, this is her destiny. Not Richard, but also other people. This is an obligation because she enjoys the right, and if she really does not want to fulfill this obligation, she can choose to leave the floating island immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco knows that he can’t leave here. In fact, every normal aristocratic child knows his own responsibilities and the rights he can enjoy, and accepts his own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Cocoa gave up the resistance, Richard snorted and stepped back, and a detection was thrown on the cocoa. Unsurprisingly, there are only a few places on the cocoa that reflect weak magical fluctuations. Such weak fluctuations mean the same bearing capacity as ordinary people, and no magical texture can be attached to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took back his hand, took off his coat, threw the boots to the door and lay down on the cocoa bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Richard patted the position around him. Coco bite his lip and walked away with his life, lying down to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is very narrow, and Richard’s body is fully grown, plus cocoa, it is very crowded. When Coco went to bed, he was taken by Richard in his arms, and his body was tightly attached, and he could even sense the other's heartbeat. Coco's heart beats wildly, and Richard's heart is slow, firm and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the girl’s surprise, after going to bed, Richard did not have any other movements, but slowly closed his eyes, and after a while it sounded a little The buzz. He actually fell asleep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa can hardly believe that all this is true, but it happens in front of you. She did not dare to move, for fear of awakening Richard. This persisted for a while, and Coco could no longer support it. Everything that happened tonight was only a few minutes before and after, but for her, it seemed like a century. Her body softly slammed on Richard, and her tiredness came in and her eyes gradually closed. When stupid, Coco feels like this, relying on Richard, there is a strange sense of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic lights in the room are running out of energy and are gradually dimming. The seeds placed in the corner of the room emit a misty blue glow like a rainy day, adding a layer of coldness to the small room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long I have slept, when the cocoa woke up, the day outside was not bright. When Lee got out of bed and started to dress, the door just sounded a few soft and rhythmic knocks, then he calmed down. This kind of knocking from the volume to the rhythm is completely in line with the etiquette, only the old butler can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
