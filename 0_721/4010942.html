You also saw that in any place in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, including your private temple, my authority is much higher than you. In addition, I have seen the number of gods I have, if it is not very If it's clear, that's okay, I can let you look at it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard reached out and the heart appeared to be gorgeous. Excessive time hourglass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing this hourglass with his own eyes, despite the expectations, Xifa was still shocked and widened his eyes. Such a gorgeous time hourglass, she never even imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t have to count how many patterns there are, just look at it and see. The rules of eternal and time dragons in this respect are simple and unconventional. The more grace, the more gorgeous the hourglass is. This is a vulgar setting that is not customary, but it is also very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the hourglass has been gorgeous as if it were covered with a layer of gold, even if it is a visual impact, it is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Law does not know how to describe his feelings. With such a timeglass, how many things did Richard sacrifice? Ten top sacrifices, or twenty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "You also saw that although my gods are not many, but I want to expel you, and the group of great priests outside. Going out or getting it. If you only want to be alone, then you can probably drive you out seven times and eight times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Face sè somewhat pale Straightforwardly said: "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be said, what can you give me? We have had an unpleasant start before, wanting I am afraid that it is not an easy task to erase this memory. In addition, I think that you are the master of the Dragon Temple. You should be more knowledgeable than the priests and know what your true status is."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei revealed a sly but with a smile that could not understand the emotions of Xifa, continued: "In front of the old dragon, none of you are irreplaceable. Maybe you all have good talent, but it will use you, not because of you. Talent, but only because you have reached its standard. To achieve the standard is enough, no matter how high the talent is meaningless. The reason why the old dragon needs the gods, the saints, is simply because it needs some good-looking furnishings to show him The status is right. Am I wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Xifa is even paler. This is actually what she suspected, but she has never said so straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, only the high authority of the gods and me is special. I can turn an ordinary person into The great priest can also make a big priest become the head of the dragon temple, for example, the one who is waiting outside." Richard concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...how can you know so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I happen to have a friend, and the relationship between Eternal and the Dragon of Time is not so simple. She told me, otherwise I don't know if my title authority is so good, I will be bullied by you. Hehe, if That's it, it's a big joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western sighed, and the last trace of my heart went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled helplessly and said: "Since you know so much, you know that I can do very limited things, at most, to provide you with a special The exclusive sacrifice channel for me. If you come to the Eternal Dragon Hall in the future, you don't need to go through the channels of other families of the dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So? Richard is not surprised that Westfa knew his first secret sacrifice in the Millennium Empire. That time he consumed a major humanity of another ancient family. This may be one of the reasons why the chief priest was against him. However, he is not interested in the grudges between the nobles within the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xifa bite his teeth and suddenly his heart sighs and says, "So what can I get from you? I can pay, but I also want some return! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak!" Richard smiled. Kenti’s request is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xifa gritted his teeth and said, "I want the presidency of your sacrifice. You don't have to monopolize, but you must wait for it than the one outside... That woman is more! Even if it is only a little more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up straight and nodded: "There is a very ambitious idea. Then my What about the return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western law is a stiff, hesitant moment, she finally stood up and walked to Richard, then a little clumsy and stiffly close to Richard The body sits down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard reached out and provoked her chin. Xifa was stiff and didn't resist. He just closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a little bit of water on her lips, then took a note on her ass and said, "Okay, I will accept the goods." As for when to eat you, I will talk about it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westfa opened his eyes, and at the moment she couldn’t tell what her mood was, Richard actually So let her go? This made her relieved, but there was some faint loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she also knows that in this man there may be the secret of becoming the eternal and time dragon god, at least through his relationship with the old dragon . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great priest, becoming a god is the ultimate dream. Although the gods will eventually go to the dark areas to develop, but that is their only chance to get zì yóu action rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked out of the log house. This time, Westfa was walking alongside Richard and was slightly behind. Since weighing the pros and cons and making up her mind to compromise, her mentality has also undergone some subtle changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western France, do you know why you can't become a gods?" Richard suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western French immediately jumped a few times, she barely kept the surface calm, but the slight trembling voice betrayed her: "Why?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her deeply and said, "Good performance. I will give you some advice after a while. But I can give you a piece of advice now." Being a god is not a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I am willing to pay any price!" I can see that Westfa Very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only sighed and said nothing. At this moment, he remembered the exclusive temple of Vatican and quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one endless time sand in the shrine of the sand. It is like a desert, nothing else. And the temple of Vatican is simply, that is, an empty temple, there is no sand at all. The two of them stayed like this, and they have not known it for hundreds of thousands of years. Time is meaningless to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what kind of talent can endure such an environment for thousands of years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly trembled in his heart, remembering something that he had never thought of before. He has vaguely known the story of some Vatican, knowing that Vatican is already in the limelight, so he is alone in the temple. So what is the sand, the sand is for what, is there some unknown story behind her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she first saw sand, she was just a teenage girl, no bigger than Richard. Therefore, Richard is always easy to subconsciously ignore the identity of her god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how can a girl be able to endure the unchanging loneliness of the desert? Even if Richard himself, there is no such strong confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Westfa saw the sudden emotional changes in Richard and tried to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just remembering something that was previously ignored. Let's go to sacrifice now, I don't have much time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westfa reached out to shake the power of time, the surrounding scenery changed, and the two returned to the Hall of Time. The priest was still waiting there, his face was full of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked up to her and said, "Help me prepare a sacrifice. The brave need to get the rewards they deserve."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Your Highness!" The official was excited and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman who squats!" Looking at her back, Xifa still couldn't help but violently swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and laughed at her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction knights brought by Richard constantly carried the huge magic box into the Eternal Dragon Hall. This time the sacrifice was unexpectedly large. It also changed the face of many priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just looking at the number of magic boxes, you know that hosting this sacrifice is at least equivalent to less than 20 years of struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this time, Richard also made ample preparations. He brought in 15 top-level sacrifices, which was the accumulation of all this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the true number of sacrifices, the young and beautiful grand priest held his breath and stayed on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ceremony is about to begin." Richard reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She woke up from the state of absence, looked at Richard, and whispered softly: "Thank you! You can tell if you have any needs in the future!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately emphasized any word, meaning it, any man who is not too stupid will understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha just smiled and said nothing, walking to the altar. After a while, the light curtain rose and surrounded the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful big priests stand outside the light curtain, watching the rising light curtain, the face is excited, but also somewhat complicated, but more It was the madness and firmness in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a saying that Richard did not say that this big priest is more likely to become a god than the Western law. The former chief priest is also easier than Western law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western is too sensible, she will weigh and choose. A sane person sometimes becomes very weak. Just as she stepped back in front of Richard and eventually lost herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dragon does not need a wise and intelligent person. It needs a madman, a madman who would rather sacrifice his own destiny and soul for some reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when standing in front of the altar, Richard’s heart was not calm at all, but the heart was ups and downs. He didn't know why the sand would become a god, but at least she knew why she went to the dark area in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, when thinking about this, Richard found that he was not calm in his imagination, and his heart was still hurting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you think about it, the wound that has never healed will be turned over again. So every pain is so fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, pressed down the undulating mood, placed a piece of sacrifice on the altar, and then mechanically chose God. This process has long been ripe for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
