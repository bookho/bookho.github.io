			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is divided into dozens of small squares, each containing an ore The sample, with a note, says the amount of this ore. Seeing this batch of raw ore, Billier’s eyes suddenly brightened. He is engaged in the business of ore. You can distinguish the type and quality of the ore at a glance without looking at the instructions on the paper. Instead of immediately expressing his opinion, he picked up a piece of ore and carefully identified it as if he were playing the lover's milk/room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman stretched out his fat hand and grabbed a piece of ore to play with it, seemingly casually saying: "I heard of a second-class caravan of the Red Cossacks. It was just robbed, and the caravan seemed to be carrying a variety of rare minerals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his hand and knocked on the box, said in a soft voice : "Those minerals, aren't they all here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, you do! The courage is not small." Tiffman looked at Lee meaningfully. Take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "When I first arrived at the blood-stained land, a team of people was almost killed by the red Cossack. I sent people. To negotiate, the harvest was a few months ago. They used a few thousand horses to kill me and wanted my life. Unfortunately, except for dropping hundreds of bodies, they didn’t get anything. Since they are the first When I opened my head, I didn't respond too much. It was just a beginning. This time is just the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guys are desperate. Tiffman said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desperate? Then let them become real corpses." Richard smiled and said a very cold joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and the red Cossack, if you want to end," Amman asked as if carelessly. "I mean, if, how do you prepare to end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "They have offended me too much, so it's not so easy to end. When I made the idiot that I decided to kill, no matter who he is, I have to see his head in front of me, and hatred will end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Old man Amman shrugged and said: "It seems that it is not a wise decision to get into you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people present are experienced and see Li Not only to retaliate against the red Cossack, his real purpose is to stand in the blood of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the goods..." Richard looked around and waited for the decision of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billiel gave a sigh of relief and said, "If this shipment goes to the human kingdom, it can sell 280,000 gold coins at market price. I don't care about you." For what reason is not to sell this shipment to the Sequoia Kingdom, but here is the blood-stained land, this shipment once belonged to the red Cossack, so the highest price I can give is a 40% discount on the market price. The advantage is I can eat all the goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billier gave a good price. However, Tiffman said: "I can eat this shipment with 50% off. Anything that can make Red Cossack suffer is a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With you." Billier apparently is not prepared for a higher price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard indulged and said: "55% off, but half of them can be replaced by barbarians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave trade of Jinhui Battle Flag is also very good. Big, Richard's proposal is a good suggestion for Tiffman. Taking into account the bargaining power of the barbarians, Tiffman actually bids slightly less than 50% off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Richard very deeply and said, "Good! You don't have to worry about the quality of these barbarian slaves, you can see them tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70,000 gold coins, if Tiffman is interested in taking care, then Richard will be able to get 80 young men and savage. Barbarians are born warriors. If equipped with the right equipment, they can play a fighting force ranging from eight to ten. With this batch of barbarians, Richard’s strength will climb again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about the stolen goods transaction, Richard and Amman agreed to visit the Sanctuary Swordsman Luofu tomorrow. Luofu got one of the last two installations, obviously not enough, so this time it was a little down and I met Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard was a little empty, Clark immediately asked about the battle of the dusk castle, and everyone showed a very interesting expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight Castle, Sinclair and her town bear knights were wiped out, but the details of the battle were not known. The great aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom did not care too much about the war that took place on a baron. It was said that the evil spirits were different, and there were more such things happening to the Dukes of the ancestor worship. Moreover, in the eyes of the great aristocrats, the ectopic invaders who can be eliminated by a baron are also weak. As for the failure of the Temple of the Allied Forces and of Allen, it is obvious that they are too incompetent. Baron Fontaine was a small and famous commander and swordsman. He has stood up for many years. He also had the merits of opening up the territory, but he died in this battle. Therefore, people naturally attribute most of their credit to Fang Dan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the blood-stained land only believe in power. They have seen the strength of Sinclair at the expense of tens of thousands of lives and several strong sanctuaries. So of course I don't believe the set of words of the kingdom aristocracy. Only Richard, who has also experienced the Sinclair war, is closer to the truth. Even if Richard conceals something, it is more credible than the aristocrats. Moreover, in the eyes of Clark, Amman and other interested people, it is the key to the death of Sinclair by the smudged scroll of the gods that Richard took out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was stunned and quickly analyzed all the possibilities in his mind before saying: "Actually, the battle from the beginning, Sinclair There was no light injury on the body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha basically restored the battle of the day, but only a little processing. Of course, he did not mention the mother's nest, and also omits many key messages of his own follow-up. He also undermined the strength of Sinclair through the injury, and artificially raised the personal strength and strength of the Baron Fontaine. Even so, Richard also talked for ten minutes before describing the thrilling war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost everyone who listened to the breath, and the person with good personal strength and savvy eyes quietly verified the comparison with Richard. Feasibility, but the lie that Richard has the talents of both real and wisdom can definitely stand up to repeated scrutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Clark asked in a hoarse voice: "Mr. Richard, I heard that you have a young and promising sorcerer around you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean flowing sand? Yes, her faith is pure and sincere. Why, are you interested in her beliefs?" Richard replied. Richard, who has an in-depth understanding of Faro, knows that the identity of the quicksand is the best cover for their ectopic invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
