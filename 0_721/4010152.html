			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can bring her out!" Mysterious woman stressed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked at her and said in a word: "There are now Faschi, and the Knight of the Eternal Dragon Hall. More importantly, in and out." The floating island will inevitably leave traces, and it will not be completely undetected. Once this incident is overwhelming, it will be known by the sire. After you have smashed Kane today, you will rob you of Qi Qi that night? Is it a loud slap in the face of your knees? Have you thought about the consequences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman said indifferently: "What can be the consequences? He After all, it’s my father.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond whispered: “There are two princes who die in their armpits! Their offenses are definitely not as good as you plan to do. The matter is serious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman is silent, she knows that Raymond is telling the truth. Bloodthirsty Philip is not easily angry, but once it is angry, it must see blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s voice immediately turned soft, saying: “There is one thing, I will not let you sacrifice to save other women. No matter who the other person is.”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman’s lips were stretched, but no sound was made. But from the tremor of her body, I can see the excitement of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls slowly, and the seven-stringed moon in the air begins to shine. In the smashing moonlight, Raymond's eyes are deep in the sea, and his voice is firm and gentle: "My time is running out, and the Joseph family cannot break for me and the current ally Mensa." Qi fell in the hands of Richard, or returned to Mensa, or married to the Duke of Bear Peter, which is the worst result for me, no difference. For her, the three endings are completely different. The former can still see a glimmer of hope, while the latter two choices are completely hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I would like her to stay in Archimonde and stay in Lee Check, my enemies are around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how the people change, the string moon over the fauna always follows a constant trajectory, rising and falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the floating island, Richard is standing in the castle’s warehouse, watching the old butler with a group of people in the inventory of a box just arrived. Weaponry. A full range of weapons with more than 50 enchanted boxes, although more than a dozen people have sorted together, it takes a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just used sacrifices, and he can’t use magic for the time being, so he can’t meditate or paint. It is not too heavy work to complete the next stage of development planning. It only takes a little time, so Richard is now in a lot of leisure time that is completely idle. I don’t know why this moment is all about Qi Qi. The shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl has repeatedly surprised Richard, and she has now become a very sensitive factor that can affect Archimonde, Mensa And the nerves of the three families of Schumpeter. The longer Zhai Qi stayed on the floating island, the more the dignity of Mensa and Schumpeter would be trampled in dust and mud for a longer time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Qi Qi has a trait, it is like a sleeping volcano, usually seems to be silent, even can form a lake, grow green grass, However, once it breaks out, it will be earth-shattering. It is this trait that separates her from other women and makes people addicted. No wonder Mensa will name a plane with her name. Although this is only a means to increase the value of her transaction, at least her performance in front of Richard proves that she does have this value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time another attendant sent the magic crystal. Richard opened the box and looked at the hundreds of magic crystals arranged neatly. When he nodded, he closed the lid. These magic crystals are ready for the plane transfer, and the extra ones will be taken to Faro for the transfer array and the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard is ready to bring back at least 20 warriors and step knights, as well as ten 10th-level magicians. Fortunately, after strengthening the plane channel leading to Faro, the transmission cost of each person has dropped from 20,000 to 15,000, but the transmission cost of dozens of people is still huge, which makes Licha heartache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the magic crystal in the box, Richard suddenly started a new idea, and gradually can not be suppressed. He let the attendants continue to make preparations before the start, and they hurried down the stairs all the way down to the end, he went more and more urgent, almost all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing several guarded gates, Richard came to the depths of the castle. Here, the ultra-long-distance communication and transmission magic array of the floating island is built. The operation of transmitting the magic array is very simple for Richard. He skillfully selected the dark blue coordinates and then began to insert the magic crystal into the magic array. Until the hundred and nineth magic crystals were inserted, the communication magic array slowly lighted up, and the shining magical light reflected the face of Richard's face, and the weather was uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array finally lights up completely, and Richard stands in front of the magical array and waits patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a familiar sharp and sharp voice came out of the magic array: "Who interrupted my work? Damn, if it’s not here, On an expensive ultra-long-range magic communication, I won't come in person at all! Some words, friends, know that gold coins never sleep! Every time you waste is burning gold coins!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a familiar, very distinctive discourse, and Richard can almost see through the magical array at the far end, a gray dwarf is jumping loudly and loudly Called like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, it didn’t take long for the classic image of the gray dwarf to appear in the center of the communication magic array. As soon as he appeared, he suddenly hugged his head, stared at Richard, and said, "You... you... are you... Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Licha lived, did not understand why Black Gold would be so surprised, and even he could not recognize himself. He said inexplicably: "Is not who I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get a beard like that?" The gray dwarf almost jumped his feet. Shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a glimpse of the short hair on his face and said: "But recently many dwarves have praised my beard. Is there anything wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold broke out completely: "What do you learn badly, you have to learn to sing! The guy is a taste and dwarf. The same, and there is no digital concept guy! His brain is all muscles! Dwarves, what are they?! They boast, we must oppose! They like, we must cast aside! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! We! We are born in dark blue, knowing mathematics And a truly elegant group of people!" The gray dwarf shouted for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that the gray dwarf and the ordinary dwarf are the relationship of feuding, as long as they meet, most of them will kill you. Seeing that the gray dwarf's roaring did not stop, Richard had to remind him: "Mr. Black King, the remote magic array communication costs are very expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it have to do with me? Anyway, it is your magic crystal now!" Black gold is not heartbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha cried and said, "Okay, Mr. Blackkin! Let’s talk about business now. I heard that the teacher just fell asleep?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf's look flashed a bit unnatural, saying: "Yes, Your Highness is just sleeping, you may have to sleep for a few years!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current eyesight of Richard is extremely powerful, how can he let go of the gray dwarf expression? He sank in his heart, but he quietly asked: "Why did the teacher suddenly fall asleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To restore strength. For His Royal Highness, sleep It is the fastest way to restore strength." The Grey Dwarf still decided to tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should the teacher regain strength? Is she injured?" Richard continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Yes." The Grey Dwarf hesitated and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard captured sharply from the gray dwarf's eyes, suddenly asked: "Is it related to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold smiles and says, "You can say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specific!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Black Gold sorted out the idea and said: "This is the case. After the Highness received the coordinates of the plane you passed, your Highness sent it directly to the Faro plane. Then I did not know what happened in the Faro plane. After a big battle, he was injured and returned. His Highness took a few days and went to the outside plane once. After returning this time, he confessed a few things and closed himself up and began to sleep to restore his strength. When I came back twice, my highness was much heavier than the first time, but I didn’t say who I was fighting with, only vaguely revealed that it was related to Faro. After the downstairs, some of our old guys analyzed it. I think the object of the two great battles of His Royal Highness is probably..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold took a deep breath and said: "...the gods of the Faro plane !"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly silently asked, "Why should the teacher fight the gods of the Faro plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The gray dwarf began to wipe the sweat, and the image of the magic array began to become swaying, as if the communication was disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Gold! If you dare to cut off the communication, I will fly directly to the dark blue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard screamed and scared the gray dwarf, and now he discovered that Richard did not know when he had a kind of domineering. Although it was far less than the state of Gou Thong, which made people involuntarily cringe, but Richard was angry. There are also some powers now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! But you can't tell your Highness in the future, I told you these things. Of course, what I said is just some speculation, just guessing." "Black Gold has emphasized it several times in a row," he said: "His Royal Highness went to Faro for the first time, and almost rushed over when he received the coordinates. And His Highness used the method of extracting arachnoid energy to directly construct the plane of the plane. In the past, you know that this method will basically be transmitted outside the crystal wall of the plane, and it will easily attract the attention of the gods in the plane when it breaks in. This will be the same as if you ran to the door of other people and opened the door directly. Zhang Yang. But when His Royal Highness just left, he was beaten again. At that time, all the rushing out of the broken plane was the power of the gods! But even though the highness of the temple was wolf, it was not hurt, and it was beyond the dragon. Physique, as long as you can rest for two days. His Highness is so embarrassing, mostly because he went too fast, and the result was caught by a surprise. But the second time, it is different..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
