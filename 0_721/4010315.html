			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Richard is really not heard or deliberately ignored, Cardiff It is a special one in the Tucson family, because he owns a plane of his own. This is the private property that his mother left for him. It has been developed for more than 100 years and can contribute nearly 2 million yuan of income every year. Diff competes for the biggest card of family inheritance rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the existing analysis of Cardiff’s current analysis, Richard should be able to use about 5 million funds, the auction of this level of sacrifice, the deal After that, the cash is required to arrive immediately. If the bet is won, then the final loss of Richard will be around 2 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif looked at Richard, sneer in his heart, and he could afford five million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling has been fixed, Richard and Cardiff went straight to the fifth floor and entered the luxurious and low-key auction hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of them immediately caught the attention of many aristocrats who had already arrived, so they came up to say hello. In comparison, people around Richard are even more than around Cardiff. More than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the dispute and gambling between Richard and Cardiff spread, and there were more than a hundred nobles in the auction house. Anyone who appears here will not be a very ordinary aristocrat, and most of them are connected with the floating island giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the bet, the nobles were excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury case This kind of thing is insignificant in the eyes of the nobility, most of the time is a decent excuse, not to mention the injury is only a little-known guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the bet, three million is not scary enough, the nobles are more interested in the two slaps, so understand the meaning of the face, and use such a straightforward The way it is expressed is extremely rare in the nobility circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a nobleman, it is necessary to maintain a decent image and not be so rude. If the hatred of both sides is really to be slap in the face, then it is not as good. See you on the battlefield directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think it's incredible to have such a bet between Richard and Cardiff, but it's not surprising to think about the tradition of Akford's nouveau riche and the violent reputation of spreading it. It seems that Richard The appearance is handsome and beautiful, but the bones are still a rude Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the excitement and expectation, the auction began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat calm and calm, and Cardiff is well-informed. He has always liked to play with unsure, so he has quietly told his confidants to go back and collect money. With his status in the family, he can also borrow an extra 2 million. With this extra 2 million, the total amount of money he can use reaches tens of millions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the host was on the stage with a passionate and eloquent opening ceremony to mobilize the atmosphere of the venue, and several maids who were stunned by the face were brought up with a top-level demon. The box, the lid just opened a line, and the smell of a lot of screams spread throughout the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nobility has no resentment, and it’s absolutely good to get the auction here. The more singular, the more extraordinary it is, and the more Several old aristocrats who were old and well-informed showed excitement, and Richard was a slight move in his heart, because this smell he had heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host sang: "Your distinguished gentlemen, ladies, this is our first auction item tonight, it is very precious and very special. More importantly, it comes from the extremist battlefield: the land of dusk, maybe some of you have heard of it, and even the lucky ones have used it, it will be more deeply aware of its wonderful use, it is more than one A sacrifice, but it is also a sacrifice. It is true. It is... the completeness of the bear’s first overseer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the moderator said, the bear’s lord’s ** is not just a sacrifice. In fact, the real big aristocrats value it more. There is a function, but there are very few who actually put it on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the lowest quality sacrifice, but it is often able to sell the price of intermediate sacrifices. The reason is that after the refining, it will become a dose. The ability to use multiple times of secret medicine can make any male revive in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is not only as simple as an aphrodisiac, but when the concentration is sufficient, it allows the user to obtain the racial ability of the bear's first warlord, that is, the possibility of temporarily changing the size of the male device and making the woman pregnant. Great increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the former or the latter, in the eyes of those who are old, but still holding weight and wealth, are worth a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the voice of the host fell, and immediately people began to scream and scream, the sounds came one after another, and the price immediately crossed the threshold of 400,000 low-level sacrifices. On the 600,000, then seventy, eighty, until 900,000, approaching the million mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One million." Earl of Cardiff first quoted, this thing has no effect on him, but it is to donate to the Eternal Dragon Hall. It doesn't matter, as long as it can be a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the price exceeds 1.2 million, the quotation quickly becomes slow and hesitant, because 1.5 million is the price threshold for intermediate sacrifices, How can the squad of the bear's first warlord be scarce, but there will always be outflows, and in any case, the level of intermediate sacrifices will not be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One and a half million." Richard screamed a price that made the audience quiet for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing has an additional meaning for Richard, is to complete the agreement with St. Lawrence, but because it involves the white night, he certainly will not take this thing Handed over to St. Lawrence, the old man’s wish can only be released later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the second battle of the field, Richard found that the relationship between the old man and the white night is complicated and special, the old man wants to go to bed with white night, more like It is a threat under some anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the old man’s hand can be compared with the installation technique, how can it not cure his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole scene was silent, and eventually this thing fell into the hands of Richard. Richard just told me: "Wrap it up, give it to the eternal dragon together." The temple is sent." There is no more of the following, and I don’t even look at this special thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from, Cardiff clenched his teeth, and the handrails of his hands were deformed. His bid has reached 1.3 million. Actually, he is not far from Richard, but he just dare not raise the price. When Lee shrinks, he put himself on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the moderator announced the successful auction, he suddenly remembered that he would be afraid and made a mistake that should not be made. It doesn't matter. In the end, it will be donated to the Eternal Dragon Hall. The important thing is that you can't make less money than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard’s gaze looked over, and then it was not too big, just to let some people hear the voice: “Marquis of Cardiff Now that the loss is still too late, the loss can be controlled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif is no longer able to correct Richard’s name for his chaotic position, he just bites his teeth back Road: "The auction has just begun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif couldn’t help but look at Lina, who was sitting straight beside Richard, and saw a trace on her face. The tension that could not be concealed, so I settled down in my heart. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next auction, Cardiff decisively attacked, and there were repeated gains, and the moment was high-spirited. After several rounds of auctions, he took two hundred and thirty to two hundred. Ten, temporarily leading Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gadif is not shooting anything, but choosing something useful for the Eternal Dragon Hall, so that you can do both, and Richard is just staring at the sacrifice. Buying with magic materials, the highest bid is two or three percent higher than the reasonable price, but even then, thanks to the first bear of the first warlord, Richard's donation is only a little less than Cardiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an intermediate sacrifice was placed as the backbone of the auction, the entire auction entered the second round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif and Richard took turns to bid, almost staged a tragic scene. After more than a dozen rounds of repeated bidding, Cardiff successfully shot at a price of 2.5 million. I have arrived at this sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up on the spot, punching hard and making a very loud roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Cardiff is not happy for a long time, the next round is a huge gold black crystal, also from the territorial battlefield, the third-order structure The core material is also used in many fourth-order constructions. This piece of black crystal with a few kilograms of weight is photographed by Richard at a high price of three million. It suddenly makes Cardiff's small heart tremble. Richard has already It took five million, which is the limit of Cardiff’s estimated cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
