Fang Dan’s injury was heavy, but at that time he saw it very clearly. He had not yet reached the point where he couldn’t save it at all. The sand drifted and he was given a serious treatment for him. Of course, the combat power after the wound was inevitably affected. How suddenly he could not get it. To the point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the battle, Baron Fontaine was taken off the battlefield and returned to the main building of the castle to be healed by the family doctor elder. When Richard arrived, the baron’s bedroom was full of people. Many of them were women and children, and the baron himself was lying in bed, his face pale and gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner sofa, two tired old people were also sitting. They are the sacrifices of the Baron family, with the power of the ancestors to perform blessings and treatments, similar to the role of the priest of the temple, but far less powerful and extensive than the pastor's magic. They apparently had exhausted their mana, but they were powerless to the Baron's injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly walked to the baron's bed, sat down and held the baron's hand. He glanced at him and his heart fell straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a hard wound that is swallowing the life of the Baron, but a lot of rolling death and corrosion in the wound, apparently an accessory to the Sinclair attack. In this short period of time, the internal organs of the baron's body have been largely necrotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a tight heart and suddenly remembered the water that was also seriously injured by Sinclair. He immediately searched for the existence of a girl in consciousness. Fortunately, the soul was extremely weak. Still smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the arrival of Richard, Baron Fang Dan showed a happy smile and said: "Licha, my friend, we have just fought side by side, defeating the powerful The enemy. Unfortunately, I can't have a drink with you again......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay on." Richard encouraged, but he didn't believe in his own heart. Fang Dan can stick to it. This kind of injury does not mean that the sand that has been completely dried up by the power of God cannot be saved, that is, the ordinary big gods are also helpless. Only the grace can bring the baron back from the line of death. But God's grace will only be placed on the believers of the gods themselves, and as a family of ancestor worship, the baron will not ask the gods for the grace of God anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fang Dan smiled weakly and said, "I know I can't do it anymore. Look at...we can fight for me to fight side by side tonight. My...children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked over the direction of the baron's fingers and saw the four children of different ages. The youngest teenager is already fifteen years old, and she has taken off a lot of childishness. She is still a seven-level swordsman. The youngest girl is only four years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! What kind of path do you want them to take in the future?" Richard nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fang Dan reluctantly propped up his body, and the clerk next to him immediately picked up the pen and paper, he knew it would be the widow of Baron Fontaine, and Richard It is the supervisor of witnesses and wills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron's eldest son was appointed to inherit the title and continue the tradition of family ancestor worship, the youngest two children still live in the family. But the accident is that the baron asked the second son, a fourteen-year-old boy, to abandon the ancestor worship and turn to the sand and become a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a decision that made Richard aware of the accident. He stared at the Baron’s eyes and wanted to see why the Baron suddenly did it. But the Baron Fontaine had not had time to explain anything, and the look of the eyes quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness and the children did not cry, this is Fang Dan’s request before his death. Now is not the time of weakness and crying. Just as the baron of the prime year suddenly died, the blow to this family is undoubtedly very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, the elite knight’s elite knight died more than half, the standing army almost went to eight/nine, and the estimated half of the remaining people could no longer fight. . Even if the other deployment forces and reserve forces on the Baron’s territory are summed up as quickly as possible, they can only make up for two or three hundred people. This is even harder to defend against a Jazz attack, not to mention the entire family. The most powerful fighters are only 11th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the haze does not condense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Richard finally stood up and walked over to the second boy and said, "What is your name?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xissuo, Richard." The teenager said a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So Sissor, are you willing to serve a true God, become a loyal follower, and fulfill its will in the world?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xissuo looked around, only bowed his head, some did not dare to look at Richard’s eyes, whispered: "This is the decision of the father, I... willing "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence came out, and immediately a few sharp eyes fell on Siss. There was an oracle in the descendants of the ancestor worship family, which made many people, especially the two older rituals, very awkward, even if they heard it was the order of the baron before the end of his life. But their status in the family, which is the order of the baron himself, can also be rejected, although before the baron was born, this rejection only existed in the law and theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and waved, and a magical glory fell on Xisuo, letting his panic settle down. A very simple mind to appease the spell, but silently reminds everyone in the room of his identity as a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Siss, Richard seriously said: "Sisso, you have a very visionary father, but unfortunately, he can't accompany you more. Come with me, Siss, I will take you to see your guide, her name is Liusha, a godsman who is destined to be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before leaving the room, Richard looked at the baroness and looked at the young boy who had just taken over the baron. He finally sighed and said to the baroness: "The Baron had had some agreements with me, he would My territory provides food, weapons and necessary supplies. This is a symbol of friendship between us, and I hope that these agreements will be carried out. As long as they are still there, I am the most reliable ally of the Twilight Castle!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroness is sorrowful, saying slowly and clearly: "All the wishes of the Baron will be realized, so you can rest assured, Richard."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, didn’t say anything, but took Siss’s hand , left the room. In fact, he is now only a teenager who is less than seventeen years old. He is only two years older than Siss. But these few months of the Faro plane made Richard feel like it was a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the main building, the thick bloody taste once again came. There was a vague cry everywhere, and the people in the castle began to walk out of the hiding place, watching a body that had been cleaned up from the city and the battlefield, fearing to find familiar faces inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
