However, he immediately saw that the two structures and life are very different. Their functions are to greatly increase the speed of the shots, and add various damage effects. However, the two structures of Richard need to be self-excited and cannot be superimposed. The power is not as good as life, but the burden on the body is much lighter than life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is Lawrence’s eyesight, as soon as he sees these two structures, he knows that Richard has completely ruined his life and created a new structure. The new structure is far less powerful than the life, but it is not as demanding as the user's request. The number of times that can be motivated is far beyond life. The new structure is a compromise, and the value is natural. It’s far worse than the life that can be superimposed, but the corresponding production difficulty is also greatly reduced, and the cost is also greatly reduced. It is less than one-third of the life-stricken ones. Above the structure, the practicality in the battle is beyond the majority of the third-order structure. For the strong ones who are not equipped with equipment, the promotion is huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lawrence looked at it and suddenly snorted, no longer paying attention to the specific structure function, but looking at the stroke line outlined by Richard. Come, if the whole structure is regarded as a painting, then there is no other artistic conception. Every one of Richard’s hooks is full, oppressive, and obviously has a powerful and powerful force, but it is suppressed and nowhere to be released. Looking at it, Lawrence only felt as if he had heard an injured beast, and was roaring but helplessly roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Lawrence took his eyes off the two structures and took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full ten days, Richard was once again at the door of the sun-drenched capital, and it was not far from the gate of the city. The guardian sanctuary strongman has already known Richard, knowing that this is the royal architect of the Holy Alliance, and one of the key figures in the city of the day, so he hurriedly carried him back to the city and sent it to Lawrence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard was lying on the iron platform where Lawrence treated the patient as he did last time. His injury was slightly lighter than the last time, but the body The surface is full of wounds, and there is a deep incision on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence didn’t say a word, silently began to deal with the injuries on Richard, and Richard did not speak, just quietly looking at the ceiling, I don’t know Thinking about something, in the dark and gloomy room, I only heard the jingle of various tool instruments occasionally colliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood stasis gradually became thicker and gradually faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence threw the blood-stained knife aside, then wiped the sweat with a dirty towel and said to Richard: "Oh. "You can get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha began to look up and looked down at his body. He had seven or eight wounds on his body, and he was stitched at the moment. The ground was sewn, and it looked like a scabbard stitched up by a corpse stitch. Richard tried to move the body, and the pain caused by the wound made him breathe a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know it hurts." Lawrence said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard's movements became slow and cautious. If the pain is not necessary, no one would want to experience more, pain relief and anesthesia. For Lawrence, it was only a trivial matter, but he ignored the forgetting of this step, which is obviously intentional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence snorted and said, "If you know the pain, then be honest next time, don't go outside and go to work hard, this is very interesting, day is not There is still a little old man in the capital, and there is no need to send a young royal architect to go out and desperately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the harsh reprimand of Lawrence, Richard is I smiled uncomfortably and said, "I am a quasi-magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quasi-magic mentor, that is, the big magician and several dare like you This kind of noise, you just want to die." Lawrence finally broke out, the saliva sprayed all over his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearly wiped the saliva on his face with a corner of his robes and said, "I can definitely come back alive."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "This sentence, in addition to the Marshal Lundstedt in the city, there is no second person dare to say so." Lawrence said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on his clothes and smiled and said, "Then I am the second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lawrence roared like an angry lion, bombing Richard, and the old man had foreseen what would happen next, but he could not stop it or change it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, not a week later, Richard threw a box containing two third-order structures into Lawrence's house, and he still left the day without leaving the unchanging equipment. Lawrence was just Sighed, I identified the structure of Richard and sold it to the Marshal at the agreed price. Then he purchased a lot of magic materials for Richard, sorted it out, and made the necessary processing, and put it in Li. After checking the residence, Lawrence returned to his small shop and continued to live a life of awkwardness, waiting for Richard's return. Before Richard returned, Lawrence only occasionally treated a seriously injured strong man. There will be anger in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard left for a very long time. When he came back, he not only supported the entrance to the city gate, but also carried a small parcel behind him. Just along his footsteps, there are occasional drops of blood dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the later, the more the Richard swayed, the more he insisted on the door of Lawrence, and after he opened the door, Richard could no longer support it. One fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depths of the room, Lawrence’s iconic roar: "Which is an impatient rabbit, dare to come to the door of Laozi."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed out to see, seeing Richard, who fell to the ground, first stunned for a while, did not see the person who sent Richard, only to understand that Richard is himself Come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence hates going forward, dragging Richard into the room, throwing him on the treatment table, angered: "You are more powerful than once, actually You can climb to me by yourself, but don't hurt if you have the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Li said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he is lying on the cold iron table, the beard and hair are long and thick, with a special taste, he lies quietly. There was a sentence that didn't talk to Lawrence, letting the cold instruments stir up inside his body. After less than an hour, Lawrence dealt with Richard's injury and began to examine the Richards belt. Come back to the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the spoils were inspected, Lawrence couldn’t help but say, "Yes, kid, these are all you kill."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and left all the spoils to Lawrence and then returned to his home. This time he was not eager to meditation or build the world. Inside, but moved a few boxes of spirits back, a person boring to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, a sudden voice came from the side: "Can I have a few drinks with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing a handsome young man standing next to him, apparently quite thin and pretty, Richard pointed to the position opposite him. The teenager sat in the past and then caught the two bottles of spirits that Richard had thrown. It was a bit wolf. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager took a small bottle of wine carefully, and immediately coughed up, and his face flew up two dizzy, could not help He said: "This wine is really hard to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the wine that Richard got was only needed to be strong enough, and he never thought about the taste. Seeing the appearance of the boy, Richard just smiled and then sipped on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Richard, I heard that you are a big builder. Is that true?" The boy asked, he looked at Richard’s gaze. Full of curiosity and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and asked: "Little guy, what are you doing here, this is not the place where you can participate."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager straightened his chest and said proudly: "I am already 18 years old, not a little guy, and I also have 17th grade."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyes are slightly bright, then the light is dim, just faintly said: "The 16-year-old little guy, depending on your fifteen-level level, as long as you leave the eyes of adults, always Life is dangerous, your 17th-level breath can't lie too many people, don't expect to rely on a necklace to do whatever you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager's face is awkward, Then he fell into dismay and said to Richard: "Well, Uncle Richard, I am the nephew of the Tamar's Principality. This time my father took me here to hold a ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle." Richard cried and laughed. He was only 21 years old, and when he was sixteen years old, he became an uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He habitually stroked his chin and found that there was no longer a hard scorpion, but a thick, thick beard, unconsciously Richard, who has not trimmed the margins, has had a face full of thick whiskers, his hair is also uneven, with a cloth strip randomly behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
