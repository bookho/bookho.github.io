			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the body of a dynasty, there is still a person standing there. A man with a very majestic appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is of medium build, his body is like a steel tower, the bright red robes are floating on the light, and even the bright baldness seems to be exuding The light of the light! His upper lip has a striking thick short beard, a short and thick scepter in his right hand, and a valuable white crystal embedded in his head, which is slowly emitting the Holy Glory<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you can't recognize the iconic red thick short beard, only look at the rich power of glory, Richard immediately knows the identity of the man in front of him, he is the presiding officer of this temple, Essien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All clerics who participated in the ceremony died under Richard’s fireball, and Essien was unscathed by strong divine protection, but his The response is obviously just enough to protect myself, and I have not had time to benefit my colleagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien glared at Richard, holding up his scepter and pointing to Richard, shouting loudly: "The devil in the ectopic plane! Your greed and boldness will Bring you endless pain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien’s first words are loud and thunderous, and the words are louder without a word. As thousands of people are shouting in unison, the whole temple is resonating with his voice! At the same time, the vision is sudden, and the image of the god of courage is slowly moving, and slowly begins to be in the right position!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling of indescribable fear floats on Li I noticed my heart, and the sand behind me suddenly screamed: "Don't let him finish! My power is suppressed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water splash from a shrine knight Open, and turned to Essien, but Richard yelled: "Shuihua! Come back!" She glanced, but obeying the order of Richard is instinct, so a turn in midair, several consecutive ups, Returning to the Knight of the Temple, the guide of the eternal sleep directly points to his unprotected face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball flew out of Richard's hands and shot at the left rear of Essien. The fireball landed, but did not immediately erupt, but could not stop spinning, the devastating energy of the group was bound by magical power in the flickering fireball, and it was increasingly violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a time-delayed fireball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essin's pupils shrink, but they don't move, the anger in the mouth is always non-stop, and the sacred power in the whole temple for many years is being voiced by him. A little bit of leaping, constantly gathering at the front of the scepter. Then the white crystal began to bloom in a milky white light, more and more intense, like a thunder that will break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry, another fireball flew out, and fell to the right rear of Essien, still no explosion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one second later, the third fireball was shot from Richard! This time it is no longer a time-delayed fireball, and the drop is in front of Essien. The falling points of the three fireballs form a perfect triangle, and Essien stands in the center of the triangle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien’s red eyebrows are almost erected, and if the heart stops beating, there is no sound in the big mouth. Everything was completely submerged, as if the entire hall had only a few rings of magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
