			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice is long, long and long-lasting. The priests also show envy, a large number of different kinds of sacrifices, is the favorite combination of eternal and time dragons, often get extra grace, see the happy face of the sand sand, you can know that God has How much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the priests saw that the look of Richard was different. In the past, Richard could say that the entire Holy Alliance left them the deepest Impressed people, he not only comes to the most diligent, but also brings a large number of sacrifices, and from Nolan, you can also see to what extent Richard's exclusive plane has developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that Richard is only twenty-one this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal dragon hall 12 or above priests have the ability to distinguish the traces of time lapse, that is, to identify the true age of an item, and a person's The real age, the time of the floating world has only passed more than a year, but Richard has been fighting for five years in the plane. In five years, it has turned a former boy with autism and autism into a modern one. An important figure in the Holy Alliance, people have even begun to talk about whether Richard will open a miracle for three years like Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the priests don’t know that the smile of the quicksand is not for the sacrifice, but for the coming night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice is long and the night is much longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard has a long and fierce experience, and he has a strong and prosperous life, and he has been dying, dying, and arbitrarily slaughtered, then Richard Found that this is not the end of his / mother /. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sand is raining, it is more and more beautiful, and her body and mood are equally pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is finally over. At dawn, Richard feels happiness as the sun comes along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a war, there is always a win-win, after the winners and losers, the winners are poor and chasing, and there are also beaten dogs, and the sand is obviously Belongs to the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers have been rushing back from all the planes. Richard and Liusha also arrived at the Black Rose Castle through the transmission array, and got the news of the return of Richard. Elliott also came over the first time, when Richard In the conference hall of the Black Rose Castle, the conference room was already in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked into the distance, a familiar face swept from the front, water, twilight, Oral, Sandro, Zonghu, Nai You, Lina, are people who have followed their own for a long time. Senma and Axiris are still the people who stayed in Gordon. They did not show absolute obedience and obedience to Richard. Richard can understand. Now he understands that these two men are not unruly, but in this way commemorating Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a while since Modred walked over from Favord. They also know the news of Gotton’s departure, just these two people, maybe Also included Wald and Han Erdong, in this way to commemorate, or look forward to, expecting Gordon to create a miracle again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gund, Tiramisu, Io, and Oral are still guarded by Faro. In the past year, Richard’s Crimson Principality With the support of high-end equipment, which is continuously input from Noland, it continues to advance into the depths of the ancestral highlands. Now it has penetrated hundreds of kilometers and firmly controlled the occupied area. During this period, the Iron Triangle Empire and the deep The friction of the Red Principality continued to be continuous, confirming that Richard was not in the deep red Principality. The half-dominant army of the Iron Triangle Empire was still on the vast battlefield and the Crimson Principality, and the leader was re-enabled. Salenwell, it is said that there is also Li Shilongtu’s most effective staff assistant in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the deep red Principality is surprisingly surprised. It’s not the wolf-like followers who are leading the army, but the mysterious General Anrekala, and Anerika’s partner is black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anrekara, now the most mysterious figure in the entire deep red duchy, the mystery is even on Richard and the quicksand, no one knows his origins And he doesn't always appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anrekala always appears suddenly and suddenly disappears, but when he appears, it must be accompanied by an almost unbeaten record and unpredictable The use of soldiers is an occasional failure. Afterwards, it will prove to be a premeditated fraud. Now, after Richard, Anrekara has become the second god of war in the Grand Duchy of the Crimson, and his life has not been truly defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Allenville once again led the army to provocate, Anrekara suddenly appeared, and led the elite troops of the Principality to attack, this time the deep red Principality remains The strength is less than the opponent's tradition, with 8,000 to 10,000, but the real combat power, the 8,000 people certainly exceed the 10,000 main force of the Iron Triangle Empire, because it contains a full thousand humanoid knights armed to the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was unfolding on the vast battlefield of hundreds of kilometers. The two sides were maneuvering, detouring, and arranging. They almost played their tactical abilities to the extreme. In the end, Anrekala still won, forcing Saranwell to fight at an unfavorable time and place. In the end, the 10,000 main force of the empire only escaped more than 3,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, Anreka’s name became a great name, and in the Iron Triangle Empire, he became a famous person who changed his mind. Saranwell made a secret report to the imperial emperor and all the core decision-makers. In the report, he analyzed in detail the advantages and disadvantages of Anrekala and concluded that the mysterious general was indeed a rare star on the mainland. The soldiers can hardly find any weakness, but he still can't compare with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard, Richard can win a war in the face of a war that is arguably impossible to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Anrekala is still a famous person, but Richard is like the embodiment of the military god in the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world famous, the military god incarnation, there is no difference to the Iron Triangle Empire, the entire empire can not find a star who can match them, then Only relying on the strength of national strength, assembling the army to fight with the deep red Principality, but this is a war against the national movement, no one dares to draw conclusions, and ultimately, this meeting did not yield any meaningful results, just decided Collect the information of Anrekala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an effort that is doomed to no results. In the deep red duchy, only a handful of people know the true face of Anrekala, the mystery of the new generation of the Principality The military god is actually just an elite knight, any elite knight, as long as he wears the armor, it is Anrekara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond plus the brain, is Anrekara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this exploratory small-scale battle, there are not many war dead on the Iron Triangle Empire, but there are as many as 5,000 prisoners. The Crimson Principality is now There is a famous policy, that is, it does not abuse prisoners, and it does not deliberately kill opponents on the battlefield. Even after the war, it will treat the wounded of the enemy, benefiting from the vast and extravagant pastor regime of the Principality. Always get treatment, and seriously injured people have hope to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the enemies of the Principality, this policy is a headache for them, the Principality of the Red Red is allowed to redeem the captives, and in any case Allow redemption, even if this practice is to re-send the other party, but the redemption price of the Principality is double that under normal circumstances, which puts heavy pressure on the enemy country, from any country, from the Iron Triangle Empire to a small In the Principality, in the case that the price set by the Chonghong Principality is still within a reasonable range, it is impossible to not redeem its own soldiers. Since the founding of the Principality, the war has been almost invincible, and the number of captured prisoners is numerous. It has put tremendous pressure on the finances of the hostile countries. For a little longer time, another effect of this policy will begin to manifest itself. That is, any legion will fight against the Crimson Principality, even the most elite legions will involuntarily retain their strength. The fighting in the end of the battle has fallen sharply. I know that surrender can live well. In the case of unfavorable conditions, the war of death of the soldiers is also greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
