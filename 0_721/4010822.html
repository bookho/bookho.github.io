			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Ou Ruo was deeply stunned by the audience before the front of the box It seems to be humble and said: "I am sorry, because this thing is too important for Master Fitzrok, so I am determined to win." He paused and said in aggravated tone: "I think, distinguished gentlemen, ladies, you It is not deliberately obstructing the masters of the sacred sects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of these words is already very strong, and many nobles, despite their dissatisfaction, But they did not speak, and the heart of the mountain lord was not indispensable for them. For this reason, Fitzrock was offended, and the price was indeed a bit large.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosting Although people are dissatisfied, there is no way to take Ou Ruo. Earl of Ou Ruo is not only the agent of Fitzrock, but also a sanctuary of heaven and a constructor who can make a third-order structure.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the silence of the audience, Earl Ou Lou smiled, turned back and sat on the high back chair, and put his feet directly On the handrail of the box, this action is simply defying the audience. It may be certain that Fitzrock became a holy constructor in the heart of Ou Ruo, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The host raised his voice and asked: "The heart of the mountain lord, there is no one to bid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the auction house, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl of Ou Ruo sneered and said, "Why do you have to work again? I don't believe who dares to go with Master Fitzrok." This time he lowered his voice. But still enough for at least half of the people to hear,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host of the auction was flashed with anger, and then resumed normal, with a gentle and sweet voice Say: "Repeat again, there is no one to bid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice did not fall, she heard a gentle voice saying: "Two top festivals ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is gentle and sweet, but it is particularly harsh in a quiet auction hall, and to Ou Ruobo For Jue, this is simply the slap in the face,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped up from the seat, his eyes swept over the box, then I stared at Richard and said one word at a time: "You want to be an enemy of Master Fitzrok. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said faintly: "This is the auction venue. If you can't afford the price, you can get out. Don't just call it out here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You" In an instant, I was so angry that I almost immediately rushed to kill this kid who didn’t know how to be good, but he still had a line of reason and controlled not to start in this place,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He grasped the hand of the railing, tightened tightly, in the eyes of the host's extremely dissatisfied, pinched the cast iron bar, and Ou Ruo suddenly sneered, saying: "I want to compare wealth with a big builder." Ok, I will see how much you have, the fare increase, two top sacrifices, plus one more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two million. "The voice of Richard is still peaceful,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five million "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction has been one after another, and compared with Richard’s consistent indifferent, Ou Ruo’s voice is getting more and more excited, and the discerning person knows the current price at a glance. Has Approaching the bottom line of Ou Ruo, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotation on the field has indeed reached an outrageous level, and it is no wonder that Ou Ruo will be out of order,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Lomdock moved, slightly uneasy, whispering to Richard: "His Highness, this price is a bit too high, you have to be careful, Ou Ruo is Set a trap for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered back: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As a sacred architect, Richard is very aware of the special value of the heart of the mountain lord. This thing can indeed be used as the core material of the fifth-order structure, and it can even become the core material of the super fifth-order structure. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I believe that Fitzrock will do his best and will not miss this great opportunity,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked out a new price and said to Lomdock: "How can Fitzrock use such an agent, this is simply to offend everyone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal agent saw that Richard was still relaxed and relaxed, and smiled and said: "Fitzlock was originally extremely arrogant and rude, in the empire. He didn't offend a lot, but there are several fourth-order structures. It's really only he can do it, so many people choose to endure. Fitzrock is not stupid. He also knows who can offend. Who can't provoke, in addition, Ou Ruo, who has strength and is the brother of his favorite lover, will naturally be more arrogant. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard felt that the eyes of the two swords fell on himself, but did not care to say: "It seems that Ou Ruo thinks that Fitzrok will definitely be promoted to the holy frame, so there is no scruples, plus one. Ten thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price is obviously about to defeat the nerves of Ou Ruo. His entire upper body is pouring out of the handrail and staring at Richard. The cold said: If you count something, dare to grab something with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t look at Ou Ruo, just nod to the host,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host then asked if there was still someone bidding after the silence time had arrived, and asked for three times, and the lottery was settled,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo's face became ugly, and turned to Lomdok, asking: "Lord, you sit here, it means that the Emperor is also supporting this idiot." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomdock is not an ordinary nobleman, he flashed a sigh of anger in his eyes, then stood up, Apologizing to the audience, I turned to Ou Ruo and said: "The Earl, please pay attention to your words, even if Master Fitzrok really becomes a holy constructor, I believe that he will never tolerate any insults. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo was speechless, opened his mouth, his face rose to purple, and he immediately said: "Add another 12 million." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price has far exceeded the recognized value of the heart of the mountain lord, showing that Fitzrok is really determined to win, and that Ou Ruo’s arrogant 'daring and big decoration "Teacher than wealth" is really not just bragging, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Ou Ruo met Richard, an alternative,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three top-level offerings." Richard is still calm, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price has completely defeated Ou Ruo, he yelled : "You can't afford this price, a liar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is still sitting still, Lom Ke then nodded to the host, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the nobility, the meaning of this little action is obvious, that is, Lomdock is young for this strange face. The endorsement of the person guarantees that he does have the financial means to pay the price, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles were amazed and curious, and they whispered and guessed which stranger would be the agent of the big man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three The top sacrifices, that is, the top giants will not be thrown casually, and for most people, the heart of the mountain lords is rare, but it is not worth the price for their use,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderator asked the bidding voice to reverberate in the hall, and Ou Ruo’s face was red and white, he could not call a higher price, but he was very aware of the heart of the mountain lord. The meaning of Fitzrock, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rounded his bloodshot eyes, staring at Richard like a red-eyed bull, saying word by word "You are determined to be an enemy of Master Fitzrok. Now you can withdraw the offer and you have time to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "According to the rules, if I If the offer is revoked, one-third of the quote will be deducted as a penalty. This is a top-level offering."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo thought that Richard was weak, and when he sneered, he said, "This is the punishment you should be subjected to indiscriminate bidding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I smiled and said, "I still have the same sentence: I will roll without money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for death." Ou Ruo screamed and pulled out the sword. In an instant, he crossed the auction hall and threw himself at Richard. His attack was full of strength, and the sword was blooming with a dazzling brilliance. He wanted to set him to death, <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo’s own strength is close to the heavenly sanctuary, and no one expected that he would actually be here, so under the sudden attack, no one can stop it for a while,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Lomdock is also a sanctuary swordsman, only stand up, suddenly feels that the waist is empty, the sword has fallen into the hands of Richard, then Richard flutters out of the guardrail and meets Ou Ruo, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ou Ruo Chong is like the wind, many people can't see his movements at all, there is only one ray of glare in the field of vision. Above the field, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is elegant and slow, like a piece of fallen leaves with the wind, every turn is easy to see, <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
