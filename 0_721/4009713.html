			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comatose blood parrot was dragged to the tavern by Naja, casually like Carrying a bag of goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deeper, the fringe area is quieter, and even the rogues who like to go out late at night can't see one. Just now, the Law Enforcement Masters Group came so far and loudly that all the surrounding lanes were closed, and even the seams of the external peeping were not. Under the weight of survival, people have completely lost their curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quietly following Naa, and he can’t see anything unusual except his face is pale, but his hands hidden in his sleeves are tight. The fist, the forearm muscles are constantly beating, and a drop of blood slowly oozes out from the fingers. The hand of Richard was originally wounded. The iron bar was not polished. The burrs and even the sand left by the mold release were attached to the surface. When he grasped it, he broke the palm. It was only a small wound of superficial epidermis, but Richard now relies on the tingling pain caused by the compression of the wound to repress the wild pulsation of the heart. In the depths of his heart, he has already fallen over the river. If he is not there, he really wants to yell and scream, and only then can he vent a little lateness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha murdered for the first time tonight, and took four lives, and the last soldier was cut open by his hand, the injury Most of the organs, and then died slowly and painfully in front of him, full of fear when he died. At the time of life and death, Richard entered an absolutely peaceful state, and all consciousness and movements were transformed into cold numbers. The skills learned from Naia were naturally used, and there was no oyster. The four killers thought that Richard was just a rookie magic apprentice, and this kind of thinking immediately gave them the price of their lives. In addition to the fireball, the other three killers were killed in Richard's unexpectedly exquisite assassination skills, and the results of the fireball, carefully speaking, are also closely related to the assassination skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the duel of the dark world, it is often the moment of passing by that has decided to live and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of decisive battle, for Richard, everything is like a dream, a real, cold, full of digital dreams. Until the gray dwarf left, he just woke up from the dream, and then the negative feelings of nervousness, weakness, nausea and convulsions began to take turns to wash Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the sadness of the first murder, Richard also felt the tension of the arrival of the blood parrot. I don't know why, the more Naa is easy, the more nervous Richard will be. His observations have always been meticulous. When Naya raised the blood parrot, he saw a little unnaturalness in the faces of Naya’s two companions in the corner of his eye, and the blood parrot even revealed unspeakable fear and moments before the coma. despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferred from Naa’s words, Richard knew that the blood parrot was famous in the dark world more than a decade ago. Such people, as well as Naya’s companions for many years, will unconsciously show tension and fear, so what will Naa’s show show for themselves after a while? And Naya has just reminded me to let Richard take a wooden barrel. Now, as soon as I think of the barrel, Richard's stomach can't help but groan. There is an impulse to immediately find a corner to spit out everything in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya and Su Helun, and the big magisters are a little similar, that is, never joking about serious things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he wanted to vomit one at a time, Richard bit his teeth to follow Naia’s footsteps and succeeded in reaching the tavern. Even Richard himself felt that this was a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Naja and Richard left, the two lazy men who stayed in the place suddenly changed. They cleaned the body with incredible speed and cleaned up the scene. After a few minutes, all the traces were almost wiped out. Only the depths of the alleys still have traces of large magical flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people in the fringe area go out of their homes tomorrow morning, they will feel that nothing happened last night. In fact, in the fringe of the fringe, similar things, including vibrations, explosions, and strange sounds often appear. People have long been accustomed to it. As long as the doors and windows are closed, there are two different worlds inside and outside the room, no matter what happens outside. The people in the house have nothing to do. The building is protected by the dark blue rule. It is absolutely not allowed to break into the door or destroy the outer wall. The perpetrator will be judged as an invasion and become a deep blue enemy. Of course, what happens outside can also become relevant, if the people in the house have too much curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya dragged the blood parrot through the small lobby and entered the kitchen from the bar. And Richard found that the kitchen space of this pub was unusually large, even larger than the area of ​​the front hall. In addition to the common stove, wine cabinet and food cabinet, the kitchen wall is also full of large and small iron rings, even a few pulleys hanging from the ceiling, and several kinds of iron hooks of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong smell of soot and inferior spirits in the kitchen, but these two strong flavors could not hold the omnivorous musty. The walls and floors are stone-built, and the wash is very clean, but there are still a lot of irregular traces on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and close the door." Naja told me to drag the blood parrot to the center of the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to the door and closed the door, and then saw that the back of the door was actually a wooden barrel that was not too small. The barrel was very old, and although it was very clean, there was no smell, but when I saw it, Richard finally couldn’t suppress the strong reaction of the body, and suddenly rushed to the side of the barrel and vomited desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to have dinner yet, so a few things in his abdomen spit out a few times, and then spit out the clear acid water. The thick sour gas rushed into Richard's nose, and almost all the taste in the kitchen was pressed down, but another unobtrusive taste became extraordinarily clear. Richard instantly judged the source of the taste, which is the taste left by the bloody years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chagang just knows that the body's instinctive reaction has prevailed, and the stomach is a strong twitch, almost shrinking into a ball. The last bitter sour water is almost sprayed from his mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Naia seems to have known that Richard will be such a reaction, but at first glance at him casually, he began to take care of himself. Come. He slammed down the iron hook hanging from the ceiling, put the blood parrot's hands and feet on the iron hook, and then pulled the chain, the blood parrot was suspended in the air, and the limbs were stretched to the extreme in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe pain caused her to wake up from a coma, and then the sharps penetrated the pain of several meridians, causing her to scream again. But after restoring the mind, the blood parrot immediately stopped screaming, but relaxed the tight body and began to observe the surroundings. But the first thing she saw was Naa, so she immediately flicked in despair and couldn't help but snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya reached out and smacked a little on her, and with his wretched expression, I couldn’t tell the truth. However, the blood parrot completely gave up the struggle, the strength of the body continued to be lost with the touch of Naa, and the despair in the eyes was so strong that it could not be fully opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
