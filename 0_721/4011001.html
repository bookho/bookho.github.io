			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, a black line suddenly appeared on the empty horizon, and there seemed to be a dark cloud in the sky. Soon the black line became a black tide, and the dark clouds became a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the long land, the number of reapers is already tens of thousands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a glance, Richard’s eyes jumped to the nearest five digits! And still jumping up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, even Richard’s face changed, and he looked back unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless mask rarely reveals a gentle smile and says, "Afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Slightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face smiles: "You are stupid, what's so scary? Even if everyone is killed, this plane is only You are alive, and you can also turn all these machines into scrap iron. This is the worst case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee smiles: "But me Hope... forget it, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is immortal, there is no perfect thing. If you are born, you will die, and if you have a defect, you will have the motivation to continue to fight. Richard knows that since he has made such a decision, he is responsible for it. He must lead all those who follow him to achieve the ultimate victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no face to face, even if only Richard himself, he will also win this war, for the first and last person to die . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the rushing reapers, even the veterans who have fought in battles are stunned, and God is robbing them. In addition to the soldiers of the hen's nest, even the knights of the knights and the sanctuary of the sanctuary have had a stir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha met, suddenly his body flashed, appeared before the front line, put three long knives one by one on the ground, and then turned back to all the soldiers Ruan said: "Akmunds! I am your king, I will take you to start this war! So this battle, I will stand here, stand before everyone! King of Akmond, should always be Standing at the forefront of the front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short words, it is more useful than what kind of agitation, because Richard is not talking about it, but using his own feet to tell everyone what is the king of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reaper's fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of rest, several new units appeared in the Reaper. Richard's gaze fell on a large transport ship that was 30 meters wide and nearly 100 meters long. These ships are flying on the ground, and they are numerous. The black tides seen by the soldiers are made up of these ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind all the reapers, there is a large battleship of 500 meters long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few kilometers from the front line, the transport ships stopped and the front bulkhead fell, naturally forming a tilted down pedal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive flesh-and-blood warriors, the spider warriors, and a fighting machine that has never been seen before. This new combat machine has a beetle-like chassis, relying on multiple mechanical feet to walk, but the upper body is a body of flesh and blood, holding more than ten different weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers in Richard’s field of vision began to scream again, and he simply turned off the display of these numbers. But the numbers no longer jump, and Richard's wisdom talent reflects the results directly in consciousness. When these marine units emerged from the transport ship, the total number of reapers has exceeded 100,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper like a tide slowly unfolds and then approaches. The black holes of the guns are like black forests, and it is possible to eject a lot of high-energy beams that harvest life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large black-pressed fighters in the sky are also in sync with the marine units, slowly approaching. When the marine units gradually entered the range of 500 meters, the fleet suddenly accelerated, and suddenly rushed to the position of Archimonde! The marine units also began to advance at full speed, and at the same time, the battlefield suddenly became so bright that people could not open their eyes, and countless high-energy beams were shot at the Archimonde position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was prepared, and immediately fell to the ground, grabbing a special tower shield to protect himself. The Archimonde soldiers also erected a tower shield, and the whole person was indented into the excavated fortifications and covered with a tower shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are specially made tower shields with a lot of polished metal sheets on the surface. High-energy beams illuminate these metal sheets and are immediately reflected and scattered by a lot of energy. The remaining energy hit the tower shield into a coke pit, but failed to penetrate the tower shield. Only the high-energy beams fired by hundreds of medium-sized fighters were powerful enough to easily pierce the tower shields, and even the soldiers who had hidden behind them were smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of attacks in the past, the reaper has been a lot closer, the fighter group is hovering above the position. Under the bombardment of high-energy beams like raindrops, the tower shields of many warriors have been damaged, and casualties began to rise rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, the coldness of the eyes, the figure flashed, has disappeared in the same place. There is also a holy sword that disappears with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the reaper fighters in a whole area of ​​the air suddenly fell to the next! Then a bright red sword light crossed, just a lot of fighters falling in the middle of the attack, a dozen hits of dozens of fighters. At this time, the figure of Richard appeared in the fire and smoke, and then gradually blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of fighters on the periphery who are turning to look at Richard, but the beams are all empty. What Li stayed in was just a ghost, and the body did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the giant ship that fell far behind the front line suddenly shook, and a huge beam of light crossed the distance of kilometers and hit the void above the fighter group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looks coldly from the void, when the light column is in front of him, simply dodge. His eyes were condensed, his hands were stretched forward, and one after another, the light of the wall emerged, and they were stacked in front of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the main gun of the big ship was so powerful that the wall could not stop it and it was instantly broken. However, the power of the main gun beam was also weakened a lot in an instant, and then bombarded Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stuck in the beam for a moment, a rollover, and the figure disappeared again. The distant ship turned again, and the muzzle was slowly pointed at an area that seemed to be empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has thus determined that this large ship does not know the method by which it has the ability to detect its position. However, seeing does not mean that it can be hit. Richard's figure is constantly flashing, and whenever it is locked by the muzzle, it will instantly change position. The giant ship swayed several times in a row, but it could not fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li suddenly flickered and appeared on the top of the giant ship, and rushed down. But as soon as he moved, he suddenly saw dozens of sub-cannon guns on the giant ship light up, and a high-energy beam of light woven into a net of death, in front of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, the fierce glimpse of the light, slammed, and slammed down, actually hit the death light net and landed on the deck of the giant ship. He did not say anything, the holy sword forced to the next insertion, the huge blade immediately fell into the hull, and then a bang, the deck was suddenly blasted a big hole, and Richard immediately jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the big ship is a maze-like passage. When Richard just jumped in, there were dozens of beams hitting him! There were fixed suspension guns and fired soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha whispered, and suddenly used the ring of the elf secret sword! The Holy Sword swivels for a few weeks, and the red sword is sharp like a sword. It instantly smashes everything within 30 meters of Richard, the fort, the wall, the floor, and the flesh-and-blood warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge void inside the big ship. Richard looked around and didn't know where it was the important part of the big ship. He simply chose a direction and rushed over. The result is a high-energy beam of light! Richard hardly resisted the beam bombardment and directly smashed forward with a sword. Jianguang once again smashed everything in the front ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no room for manoeuvre inside the ship, and almost all of the attacks have to be eaten hard. But he also has a domineering response. Anyone who dares to attack will be smashed by Jianguang along with his area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, the chilling ship suddenly swayed and then swayed more and more, spurting flames from the hull, followed by I swayed and fell down! The hull of the big ship was suddenly folded into two halves, and finally roared and planted on the ground, and it continued to explode and burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure flies out of the wreckage of the big ship, it is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the midst of hard work, the Archimonde soldiers who saw this scene all cheered! The destruction of this big ship does not mean that it can win the war, but at least let people see the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there were fires and explosions everywhere. The Reaper Marine units have rushed into battle and are entangled with the Archimonde warriors. In the position, the knights are framed in a hundred units, and they form a square array, constantly throwing a spear and blasting a fighter from the sky. The peripheral knights waved the giant sword and chopped one Reaper Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
