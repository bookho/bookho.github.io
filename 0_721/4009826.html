			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the main building is coming to an end, women and children are driven to the hall On one side, the surrendered soldiers were locked into several closed rooms. If they had a change, a fire could solve the problem. The battle on the side of the wing is nearing completion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard entered the main building, and the battle inside the building was obviously too dangerous for the magician, especially for the lower level Master. In the consciousness, Richard searched for the position of the three fast-moving beasts, and at the same time sensed their residual strength. It was better than the imaginary result. Although it was inevitably injured, it still maintained more than 50% of the battle. force. Richard ordered them to search for the soldiers hiding in the main building and then withdrew all the people back. If the fast beast loses, it can continue to produce. This group of soldiers will die one less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the hall, a dozen women and seven or eight children were huddled together because of fear, they looked helplessly at the enemies that suddenly appeared, thick The bloody suffocation almost stunned several of the aristocratic ladies, but they miraculously persisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked back and forth two times in front of them, remembering everyone’s reactions, and then said, "Who is the wife and daughter of the High York Or children? Who is the first to identify them, I will let her go immediately!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women can still be quiet at first, but the mobs’ fierce eyes And the weapons that are still bleeding are constantly reminding them of how miserable they will be. At this time, a few screams came from the depths of the main building. It was the people who were hiding and discovered by the fast beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of sternness undoubtedly shocked the hearts of women. A young woman dressed as a servant suddenly jumped up and pointed to one of the ladies and shouted: "Yes She! She is the lady!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The untouchable! I will kill you!" The scream of the lady contains extreme fear and anger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But someone opened their heads, and the rest of the people immediately followed suit, lest the only place fell into the hands of others. "This is the son of the High York Jazz!" "The vicious woman is the mistress of the High Tester!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Mrs. Gao’s Lady, two The mistress and one son and one daughter are all identified. This time, Richard was very generous. He waved to the women dressed in servants and said, "Very good, you are all free, you can go now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The women trembled to the door and found that no one really stopped them, and immediately screamed and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said again: "Oral, you bring two people, accompany this noble lady and two beautiful ladies to walk around, by the way Appreciate the collection of the High Jazz."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured, Master!" The bloody half elf responded gracefully. His life experience and keen perception in the giants made him the perfect choice for copying the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have ten minutes." Richard reminded the elf in excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... when necessary, you need a little trick," Oral said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever." Richard waved his hand, and Oral and the two stepping knights pulled up the jazz lady and two mistresses and walked upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, the bloody half-elves really robbed the wealth of the High Jazz. Gold coins, jewellery and a few rare metals totaled nearly 5,000 gold coins, and what surprised Richard was that in a delicate little box that Olal handed over, there were three magical crystals of finger size. Three units of magic crystal, you can already do something, can be used to enchant, or create magic potions and magic equipment, but also support the magic array. And from the appearance to the structure, and the power contained in it is exactly the same as the magic crystal that Richard has seen. This shows that there are also magic crystal veins in this plane, and it can even be inferred that the magic operation mode is not much different. This is undoubtedly a very good news for Richard, who is based on magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just three women, especially the jazz’s most beautiful lover, whose face is a bit unnatural, and apparently Oral has used a small ' Means' can get results so efficiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the time and immediately assigned the next task. He stuffed all the women and children into two carriages, and they were forced to withdraw to the forward base. More than 20 captives who surrendered were escorted by five descendants, and he followed him to ambush the reinforcements of the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Richard looked at the manor’s arrow tower, letting people ignite it, and the smog of the sky. This is a huge torch that is clearly visible more than a dozen kilometers away from the night. This is a hint that starting to set fire, it means that the invaders have already withdrawn, and that the reinforcements who may come from Jovan or other places will not go in the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the ambush was also provided by the surrendered soldiers, and it successfully intercepted more than a dozen cavalry and more than 20 infantrymen from the direction of the Cavaliers. Under the order of Richard, the first batch of rushing troops were still re-armed descendants, and then the ogre was wrapped from both sides, and the three fast-moving beasts sneaked around the rear of the team and launched an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is coming to an end. Under the siege of an enemy equal to a dozen knights, the support soldiers quickly collapsed, and Richard did not even find the need. The opportunity to use magic. After simply cleaning up the battlefield, Richard took these people to the next ambush spot, which was the guard from the town of Jovan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ambush was a little more troublesome, because it was not just the expected guards, but also more than a dozen adventurers. One of the older masters actually shot a fireball, demonstrating the identity of the five-level wizard. But this fireball also directed the target for the enemy. The next moment, Oral's long arrow opened a big hole in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ambush still smashed the enemy, only two soldiers were killed and three people were seriously injured. They are all under the fire of the old wizard, but under the magic of the sand, the three seriously wounded soldiers can put into battle as long as they rest for ten days. The fact that the seriously injured robes were treated by the priests during the battle also greatly encouraged the morale of the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single attack, two ambushes, has swept away the troops in the high jazz territory. At least on this night, this territory is like a girl who has faded her dress, and she can squat freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to property, Richard has available as many as 30 troops. After the capture of the Cavaliers, they received a batch of equipment and more than 20 horses. In this way, Richard formed a team and entered the town of Jovan at dawn. Two ogres and swift beasts were left outside the town, lest they cause too much panic to the civilians in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, the demon of the alien face!"
