			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can’t rule out that the scorpion’s first small squad is met. Their large forces are likely to be behind. Without an overwhelming army, how can the reaper swallow a single plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still too little information about the reaper. Richard pondered for a while and made up his mind to order a flying unit to gather all the flying units in the nearby area to fight the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain itself has a good fighting power, it can assemble more than a hundred flying units, most of which are 12-level feather snakes. After receiving the order from Richard, this brainstormed all the flying units immediately, and compiled them into a rigorous formation, throwing them at the reaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute and six seconds<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle ends in one minute and six seconds, all feathers After the war, the brain was also killed. The final information that Richard received was an image that was considered important by the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, a large-scale metal warship is parked, and it should be a transport ship from the huge cargo hold on the back. Several mechanical beetles were holding a piece of red and white squares into the cabin, which seemed to be loading the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the far end of the picture, it is a broken body. A mechanical beetle is cutting the body, while another mechanical beetle piles several armor together and tries to compress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this picture, Richard is shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How similar is this scene to the nesting worker bees collecting resources! Only the worker bees in the hen's nest are creatures, and the reapers are mechanical creations. But looking at the Harvesters, these well-defined units, they are obviously wise, and they are not necessarily lower than the Norland level. It's just that the way this wisdom exists is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is a heavy loss, and the harvest is huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha lost all the airpower in the coastal area of ​​the Northeast, and lost a huge brain and a flying scorpion, but also got a lot of key points. The data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not think that even the brain had not escaped. The speed of the Reaper fighters is close to or even more than 500 kilometers, which is comparable to the messenger. The speed of dividing the brain is only close to three hundred kilometers. On the other hand, he also found that the Reaper fighters have strong resistance to many magic, especially frost magic, and they will be flame and Lightning damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small fighters are incredibly strong, and from this point it is a metal creation. A few feather snakes bite hard, leaving only a few claw marks on them. The results of more than a hundred flying units were only destroyed by ten miniature fighters. The small fighters were unscathed, and their attack power was amazing. A beam of light could kill a feather snake. As for the metal projectile, it seems to be limited by ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha digested the information exchanged for life with his brain, and immediately gave Gende an order to let him guard against it. Don’t rush to march, reinforcements will soon To. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusted the magic map, zoomed in on the northeast corner of the Faro continent, and watched silently. After a few moments, he selected several key areas in this area to outline several reconnaissance routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately ordered the other, and the other brain was taken off, commanding dozens of reconnaissance beasts to reconcile along the designated line. The reconnaissance flying beast is divided into two large groups, one from the west to the east, and the other from the south to the north, reconnaissance along the coastline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Richard looked at the map again and made a line in the eastern part of the Iron Triangle Empire, near the no-man's land. When Richard's line was drawn, dozens of flying beasts flew to the area to prepare for reconnaissance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This line is Richard’s scheduled line of defense, where he is prepared to attack the reapers and to evacuate the scattered forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged the initial defense, Richard sent to the capital of the Iron Triangle Empire, the throne of the Cold Iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the Emperor Palace has been restored as before, and Saranwell met Richard in the Chamber of Deliberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he obviously became a little old and thin, but the momentum was also steady and majestic, with the majesty of the long-standing. When Saranwell saw Richard, he first performed a tribute to the patriarch, and respectfully said: "I have seen His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded in secret, although the time has been separated for a long time, but it seems that Salenwell is very clear about his position, and does not really think that he can be separated from Richard and exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I can see that the empire has been well managed in recent years. How is the construction of the army?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell said: "The past ten main legions have been completely rebuilt and replaced. In addition, 10 new main legions and 20 second-level legions have been formed, and preliminary training has been completed. The equipment is also in place. The number of regiments trained by the reserve has reached 50. Together with the local garrison and the aristocratic private army, the total number of empire now has more than four million!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Not bad, but still one million less than the original plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This army is enough to sweep the entire Faro! Even without them, your deep red kingdom army is enough to slap Faro? Is it necessary to retain such a huge army?" Some doubts asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining an army of this size, and gradually training into a main force, is also a very heavy burden for the Iron Triangle Empire. If not the most cost-effective main army is equipped by Richard, the new imperial dynasty of Salenwell has long gone bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and looked at Salenwell and said, "It is very necessary! Now, our enemy has come, it is very scary. Enemy. Even if I did my best, I couldn’t win the war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell’s heart sinks immediately: “You I am not sure? Is this impossible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Richard’s old rival, Salenwell is clear about how terrible the real combat power of the Richards. At the time, Richard did not make all his efforts, and he took full advantage of the main force of the Empire and conquered the Iron Triangle Empire. The three legendary powers of the empire in the past were all in the hands of Richard. For the current Richard, the complete conquest of the entire Faro is nothing but a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s ambition is not only to conquer the mortal, but he also directly intervened in the battle of God, and the three goddesses have completely become the thugs of his support. The fall of Sinai is not the end, but just the beginning. In the past few years, the three goddesses have been in full swing with the southern gods. The southern gods have already fallen, and the other two gods are in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a person actually said that he was not sure that he could win this war. What is the enemy of Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chayu wants to explain the situation of the reaper, which immediately changed the face of Salenwell. Richard is very understanding, whoever hears that his own plane will be destroyed will always have a moment of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "You put some cores The staff will be summoned and I will bring them back to my plane so that they can survive. But the number of people who can evacuate is limited, preferably no more than 10,000, and the choice is up to you. Prepare to fight with the reaper, although this basically does not make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abandoning Faro?" The voice of Salenwell was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is inevitable, my friend. And we have limited time, I don't know how fast the harvesters will progress, and how many of them are there. It's even possible that they will appear under the Cold Iron Throne next month. So, you only have a week at most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarrenville nodded heavily Said: "I understand. I need some flying cockroaches, how much can you transfer to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sinks a bit and says: "Up to twenty Only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So little I understand." Salenwell showed a blank smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only patted his shoulder and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell has understood that the position of the Iron Triangle Empire in Richard’s mind is not important. In this case, Hida is a life-saving resource. Of course, Richard must first withdraw the subordinates who belong to him directly, instead of rescue the Iron Triangle Empire of the enemy not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty Hidas are actually in the face of Salenville. They can remove 10,000 places allocated to Salenville twice. According to the time of the week, these flying dragonflies can fly again, which means that thousands of people are saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
