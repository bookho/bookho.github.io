This is my castle. There is no feather of the red eagle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant replied: "I see it very clearly. Knowing that this is your Dragon Wing Castle, the order I got was to create a level here. Anyone who wants to pass it must prove that he is not a feather of the Red Eagle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bramas glimpsed, then angered and laughed, after a long laugh, he stared at the sergeant, sarcastically said: "If you never catch the feather of the red eagle, Is it still impossible to check into my castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis is very strong, but I did not expect this sergeant to think about it and actually replied: "This is indeed very possible. If the temple came down and ordered, then the Marquis would be pleased to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Brahms pulled out to the extreme She rested on the neck of the sergeant and said, "You are a little sergeant, I really don't dare to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant is only ten Level, but looking at Brahms, there is no fear of fear, smiling and said: "The Marquis adults, we Archimonde can not be afraid of death, but His Royal Highness once said that the warrior is the same as him. If you kill us, no matter who the other party is, your Highness will kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sergeant reaches out and slowly pushes open the neck On the sword front, said: "If you don't want to cut down the Marquis, then you should not be so affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brams's face is red, neck The blue veins on the hops kept on, and he almost smashed his eyes. The hand holding the sword trembled fiercely. He wanted to cut a sword very much, and then cut the guy who dared to disrespect him into a meat sauce. It can be said that Brahms has never wanted to kill a person like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, his sword can’t be cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brams turned suddenly and returned to the castle without saying a word. The guards who followed him were all stunned, then hurriedly followed the Marquis. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, a group of griffins flew from above the Dragon Wing Castle and flew in the direction of the Sundial City. Richard could set the level to the gate of the Dragon Wing Castle, but could not manage the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis does not want to take the road, otherwise the Archimonde fighters will continue to insist on checking, he does not know if he can still stand to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Brahms has received reports before these Archimonde fighters set the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a total of ten conflicts between the two days due to checkpoints. Archimonde soldiers were killed and wounded by 63 people, while Brahms had titles. The aristocrats were thus executed 15 people, and the private army was killed more than 4,000. The death and injury of the Archimonde warriors were all produced in front of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means of Richard is obviously and clumsy. These Archimonde fighters at the gate of the castle are bright bait, but Brahms knows that he only needs one. When the sword is cut down, the army of Richard will appear outside the Dragon Wing Castle at noon. This kind of handle, Brahms is determined not to give Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Rizhao City, Richard randomly collected a noble house and set up his own residence here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security in the city of Nisshin is still under the responsibility of the original city defense army, the city owner is still performing management duties, the city defense army has 30,000 people, and Li The knights who stayed with him were only three thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is an absolute disadvantage in quantity, Richard does not worry about his own safety. There is a legendary mage in the city. What needs to be worried is the city owner, the nobility and City defense forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days, Richard has been staying in Rifu City, and he continues to make the Battle of Midrande in a step-by-step manner. Now all the materials have been collected and left. The next step is to make the parts one by one patiently and meticulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quasi-six-order construction, the requirements of the builder are much higher than the fifth-order construction, which is the magic of Richard today, often engraved with a continuous After the lines, there will be a feeling of depletion of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because his magical manipulation is extremely powerful. If you change another constructor, there is no 24 or 5 magic, it is impossible to complete these. Magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Marquis of Brahms flew over the city of Sundial on a lion's lion, Richard realized that he had sent several knights to guide the Marquis to land, and then saw the Marquis in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the meeting is certainly not so friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Brahms took a heavy shot on Richard’s desk and yelled, “Richard, what do you mean?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat leisurely and said, "My meaning is very simple. If you lose something, come and look for it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms smiled and said: "You want to fight with the Holy Tree Dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said calmly: " If the sacred dynasty had this idea, then it would not be impossible to take a trip, but together with the war, regardless of the outcome, the Brahms family is estimated to be removed from the Nolande aristocratic family."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Brahms was shocked and angry. He didn't expect Richard to be so determined. If he had provoked a war, then Brahms knew that his life was also Not too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic war, when there is little to kill, most wars end with a defeated party, may be compensation, plane, or territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two parties caught the core characters of the other family, most of them will be released after receiving the ransom, and of course, some important people will be left when they can leave room for them. One breath to avoid the escalation of the war, but at this point Richard is obviously not going to follow these unspoken rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms took a deep breath and sneered and said, "Okay, very good, Richard, I hope you don't regret it, don't blame me for not reminding you." You are an enemy of all the nobles of the dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally closed the magic book in his hand and said faintly: "Brahms adults It seems that you still don't accept the lesson. In this case, we have nothing to talk about. Let's go, oh, yes, pay attention to your manners and manners. This is my last tolerance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brams is very angry, his hands are raised high and he wants to shoot on Richard's desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s gaze fell on his hand. Brahms suddenly felt chilly. The hand trembled. Why didn’t he really fall? He had a feeling, if he dared to shoot the table in front of Richard. I am afraid that this right hand will not be able to keep it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms swallowed hard and wandered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma came in and looked at Brahms’s back and said disdainfully: “There is no courage, but you just let him go. "At least, you have to cut your feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "It’s too sloppy, it will scare people away, I still wait for them. Come call me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really can't understand you" Senma muttered, she glanced at Richard and asked: "Why, still not control Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes a while to get a lot of basic exercises," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to drawing the structure, Richard is rarely moving, it is moving, and it is slightly oyster. He is now suddenly getting tremendous power and still working hard. In the process of adaptation, it is good that the magic manipulation is not affected, and the fifth-order construction needs to go all out, so it can work normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the magic book again and said to Senma: "Since Brahms does not give up, then you will do it, this is enough for him." It’s been a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summa shrugged and said, "Okay, but I still prefer to punch his face."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the Marquis of the Marquis of Brahms returned to the Dragon Wing Castle. He had just come down from the gryphon and saw a mage rushing to the The letter was sent to the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms opened the letter, only looked at a few eyes, and shouted: "What, the army of Richard began to enter our plane." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms is well aware of the forces he has placed in his private planes. These planes have been in operation for hundreds of years and have already completed conquest, the troops stationed there. not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of the Richards, I am afraid that within three days, these defenders will be annihilated, and the wealth and resources accumulated in the plane at that time岂It is not necessary to become the object of Richard's bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage peeked at the Marquis's face and said with a hard scalp: "Adult, there is one more thing we have just noticed, the channel coordinates of the four private planes have been modified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So." Brahms suddenly felt the whole body chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now the portal of the plane channel is no longer in the Sundial City, but in the black rose castle of Ashan."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis was suddenly black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four planes, four well-developed planes, the resources that are obtained from these four planes every year are millions of gold coins, not yet Includes other benefits associated with the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you can create a new transmission channel in the future, but you want to get back to the control of the plane, it means fighting with Archimonde. Brahms is not crazy enough to think that he can single out Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms finally stood firm, did not fall, and even said: "Go, prepare for the communication magic array, I want to talk to Archbishop Lufide Go, go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, in the magical array in front of Brahms, there was a thin and majestic old man, a gorgeous robe, The scepter's scepter reveals his extraordinary identity: Lutheran Archbishop Lufide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, Richard just grabbed my four planes, and the dynasty has not decided to send troops yet." Lufei De's image just appeared, Bra James couldn’t wait to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Feide looked at Brahms deeply and said calmly: "This matter is now causing very much in both the dynasty and the church." Big controversy, I am afraid there is no way to reach an agreement in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Controversy, how can there be controversy, Richard is trampling on the dignity of the dynasty and the church, Did the old guys have their brains broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Lufide showed a helpless smile and said slowly: "You still don't know why Richard The reason for this will be that the loss of this group of god Mu Wujin, Richard can not make a new holy structure within a year, but this is not a problem, the key is that the holy structure he is preparing to manufacture is very important, It is said that it is related to whether his unborn child can survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
