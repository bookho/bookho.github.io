I always screamed: "Aha, the eyes of General Dragon Lizard? This is a good thing. What is this? Damn, the ice is too thick!" Don't waste power! I look at what is inside... Well, the heart of the captain! It's also very good! With a heart and no spine, you are really wasting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician groaned for a long time, and more than half of the material on the ground was split by him and thrown to the other side. He suddenly pulled out a crystal of water blue and screamed: "The soul of the bear's first warlord! Or the best!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician At first, all eyes are full of grievances and anger. I said in a sharp and sharp voice: "What about the male and seminal sacs of the bear's first warlord? You can get the soul crystal, how can you not get those two things?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inadvertently smashed it." White night said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician almost jumped in front of the white night, grabbed her chest, almost slobbering at her face: "Through it? You don't Do you know that this is the most precious part of the bear's first superintendent? How many bear chiefs will be killed in a year, you actually broke?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White nights shrugged indifferently, with a sign-like icy voice saying: "I don't know how precious it is. I only know that there is no such thing. You old guy can't stand it. You need me to honor that promise, now I can." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician angered to the extreme, the whole body was shaking, screaming with a louder volume than talking loudly: "I will not be so cheaper for you." The day is not so big, I don't believe that I can't buy the sac of the bear's first warlord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night reveals a horrible smile, saying: "I don't believe anyone dares to sell this thing to you. Because I have already let go of the wind, who dares to do this, then I will use the mouse afterwards." The tooth grinds his egg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The old magician seemed to be angry and couldn’t breathe, and Richard even worried that he would Just mad at this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the vitality of the old wizard is obviously much stronger than that of Richard’s imagination. In front of Richard's face, he suddenly reached out and slammed his hand under the white night, and then he slammed it down and continued to turn the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene surprised Richard, and the white night did not evade, not even counterattack. It may be to see Richard’s question, White Night explained in a constant voice: “This is one of the costs of selling goods here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that it is necessary to explain to myself in the night. But the white night can pay the price, the old magician is obviously not a simple character, at least not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the old magician had finished the material, walked behind the counter and opened the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night suddenly reached out and the man’s heart flew to the old magician and said, “This thing is counted on the little guy’s head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so generous!" The old magician glanced at Richard and said to the white night in a very mean way: "Why, this kid makes you very cool?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night actually nodded and said: "Fresh and delicious, full of weight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician once again looked at Richard with a grudge, but unexpectedly did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out one big one and two small pockets, poured a lot of magic crystals into the small pocket from the big pocket, and licked the amount, he threw it. I gave Richard: "Hold, kid! It’s not the average person who dares to move the white night. I hope that you can live longer. If you come back to the future, and I am still alive, you can come to me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the white night and said, "You deserve it, hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard no longer quits and puts up the magic crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big bag of magic crystal flashed away in the white night, and was stuffed into the space ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, the old magician suddenly looked at Richard, and his violent eyes flashed a dazzling electric light. For a moment, Richard felt that he had been through everything from head to toe, and it seemed that even every cell was seen through! The electric light in the eyes of the old magician died, and Richard had a cold sweat. He didn't even know if he should get angry. The only certainty is that it is not any kind of detection magic. But the feeling of being sensible is to make him so uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" The old magician stopped Richard and White Night. He returned to the back of the counter and took three sheets of paper from a dusty pocket and handed it to Richard. He said, "The little guy, if you can promise me, I will get a bear chief overseer when I have the ability." ** and the seminal vesicles, that thing is yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspected that he took over the paper, instinctively first identified the material and found that there was A patch of white and gray plaques, the first thing is a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are most of these papers made from the skin of deep sea zebrafish, which is one of the materials that can be used to make a third-order structure. On the paper, there is a sketch of a magical array. The most important points are several annotations and explanations circled by a square. As soon as he saw it, Richard knew that the paper was actually a design figure that had never heard of a name! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the design drawing, the name of the structure was written in Norland's lingua franca, and Richard whispered out: "Magic Arms."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical arm in the hands of Richard is a third-order construction, but the layout of the magic array has reserved a large blank space in advance. Accumulated up to one-third. In his heart, he looked at the second piece of paper, which was also armed with magic, but the blank was filled. Filling in the blanks, the complexity and difficulty far exceed the rest, making the overall structure difficult to climb to the fourth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last piece of paper, almost all of the blanks were filled, leaving only the three nail-sized parts left blank. But this is also a relatively complete structure. The difficulty of the whole frame is once again improved. If it is not the three still-deficient parts, Richard even suspects that this can be regarded as a fifth-order structure. But with three more blanks, it's hard to say how much the entire structure can play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three design drawings, in the eyes of the builders, are invaluable, especially the comprehensive balance of Richard’s ability, no obvious shortcomings and defects, the current bottleneck only Metamorphosis in magic. So Richard's hand with three pieces of paper was a little trembling, but he could hold it, and did not agree with the requirements of the old wizard, but looked at the white night. The requirements of the old magician are obviously aimed at the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white night glanced at the three sheets of paper and sneered and said, "You are really willing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician snorted and stared at the white night, one No words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Nights swayed in disapproval and said to Richard: "Promise him! Anyway, he can't live for a few years."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the approval of the White Night, Richard promised to take care of the three structural designs carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the deal is certain, the old magician suddenly flashed a glimpse in his eyes, touched the messy beard, and smiled and said: "White night, this time you are probably finally To be miscalculated! Haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night face changed slightly, but did not say anything, but pulled Richard to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the old man’s shop, White Night continued to take Richard to the highest point of the day. On the road, White Night said faintly: "The old guy is called Lawrence. But twenty years ago, he was a builder. The people here called him St. Lawrence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suddenly shocked: "St. Lawrence? Is he a holy constructor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White nodded and said: "No Wrong, although he only made a fifth-order structure. But as long as there are drawings and materials in the fourth-order structure, there is almost nothing he can't do. In the most difficult moment, the day can not persist, you can He said that he has made great contributions. Without his endless high-level construction, the guard strength here can withstand the crazy attack of Dax Sodas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also a great thing to be able to make a fifth-order structure. If such a person is in Noland, he must have a supreme status. How can he be rooted in the sinister place of the absolute battlefield? Richard is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And White Night continues: "Twenty years ago, St. Lawrence had a battle with a legendary wizard of Dakosodas. Although he eventually killed The opponent, but he was also seriously injured, and the magic began to lose, and it was reduced to tenth grade in a year. Later, although it was stable, the speed of re-upgrading was not as good as that of ordinary magicians. And his physical function was also Being destroyed, losing his stable hands, he can't make it anymore. Since then, he has been relying on shop to buy and sell materials to make a living. Because he is the only holy constructor who is willing to stay in the field. Many people here have been helped by him and... um, and torture. So even though he lost his ability, there will still be a lot of people coming to his store. He is a holy architect and legendary wizard, sometimes In a word, you can benefit a lot. There are also some people... to repay, for example, me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Richard still It’s hard to put the old wizard, the sorcerer, the sorcerer and the legendary mage. Title together. But he wouldn't ask what kind of kindness he owed in the night, he had to endure his harassment, and he insisted on selling materials in his shop. There is curiosity in front of this night of killing God, and suicide is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you go back to Noland?" asked Li. If you return to Noland, you can enjoy the treatment of St. Lawrence in terms of construction. Why do you nest in a small shop like this, when you are a poor old wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white night sighed and said: "He stayed here for three hundred years, so he could not do without the city, this land. He once said that it would rather be obscurity in this city where he has been fighting for most of his life, and he does not want to return to Noland to enjoy the funeral of luxury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
