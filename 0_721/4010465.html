			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if they have already noticed the identity of their ectopic invaders, but it’s okay to see them, now everything It’s already late, they can’t get out. Now, only the three goddesses are developing their faith in desperation. In just a few years, they have tried to continuously cross the level of divine power. It can be seen that most of them have already had a lot of thoughts about their situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any neighboring country, the Crimson Principality is now a terrible opponent with a barb. Fortunately, this monster is still restrained, no human beings. The country is exposed to claws and fangs, but almost all of its energy is placed on the ancestral highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast and innocent ancestral highlands have now been occupied by a full third. The area of ​​this land is several times that of the blood-stained land. The problem is that although no one knows whether the land is rich or barren, and whether it has any rare minerals, such a vast land, coupled with a steady population migration, It is enough to support a huge empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless eyes watching this comet-like behemoth growing at an alarming rate, not that no one thought about containment, but could not find a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimson has a sovereign state, so the war needs an excuse, and its expansion is the wild land that humans think, and it loses the reason for interference. Others want to use the way of chasing slaves to obstruct the expansion of the deep red population, but a fierce and short-lived battle that seems to be a 'slave' rebellion has completely killed this heart. Small countries are ashamed to admit that their regular army is not an opponent of the Crimson slave army. Moreover, any containment needs strength and has consequences. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, the Crimson Principality only has friction with the Iron Triangle Empire. Although there is no comprehensive war between the two sides, the dozens of battles are combined and the scale is also Reached an amazing number. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Triangle Empire was finally defeated and competed with the Crimson Grand Duchy after being defeated by the entire three main legions and five local corps. As a cost of defeat, the hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of the border areas of the Iron Triangle Empire and the blood-stained land were all occupied. Although this area is a barren land in the eyes of the Empire, its significance is that since then the road leading to the Western Region of the Iron Triangle Empire has been cut off. From the precious minerals of the pale highlands to the barbarian slaves of the ancestral highlands, all must be obtained through the territory of the deep red duchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defeat of this war, the original re-emphasis of the military power of Saranwell has become a scapegoat, the domestic accusation, he had to surrender the military power, once again return to his territory to go fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unfortunate prince has made an opponent’s fame outside of Richard, Anrekara. The mysterious Anrekala is already another singer after the discovery of the mainland, and the prestige is already faintly on the Li Shilong map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the iron triangle empire executives know that Li Shilongtu did not dare to lead the army to protect his reputation. Up and down the empire, only Sharonville has such courage, and has repeatedly lost battles and has never been discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Salenwell is longer than the overall situation and strategy, but because of the existence of Raymond, the brain and the mother-in-law, the two sides have invested as much force, In fact, the advantage of the battlefield is the deep red Principality. The difference in individual combat power makes the tactical advantage even more on the deep red side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, with the unstoppable development momentum of the Chonghong Principality, the overall national strength is getting stronger and stronger, and Allenville has the ability to do the same. Unable to save the defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has a general understanding of the current situation in Faro. He looked at the magic map in front of him and meditated. After a while, he asked to the sand: "With our current strength, is it enough to launch a war of gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sands shook his head without thinking, saying: "Impossible. The real war of God is not as simple as the church war. It is no problem to win a war like Nai, but to destroy a few gods, even to destroy It’s not a fatal blow to lose one or two avatars. It’s not a fatal blow. What’s important is that we have no way to break into the kingdom of God, and it’s not a fundamental threat to the true God. The gods are born by the rules of the plane. Without taking away his godhead, even if we kill all their believers, he can survive in an endangered state for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So legend... ..." Speaking of this, even Richard himself shook his head. The biggest advantage of the legend is not the legendary ability, but they have some ability to use the rules, whether active or passive, which gives them a leap in the various attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any legend, even a parallel product like Dragon Star, is not so good. The hardest part is not to defeat them, but to trap them so that they can't run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s strength and the followers’ current strength, the ordinary legend is single, and it will certainly be horrible, but it’s not really possible to kill him on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to what Richard is afraid of is the legendary sneak attack in the dark, today sneak attack one, and then assassinate one tomorrow. This kind of warfare has almost no solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he is in the situation, Richard understands why Noland is so respectful to the legends, regardless of their character. The key is actually not willing to offend a legendary strongman. If a legend doesn't look up, no one can resist it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not the time for a big attack." Richard frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are just worried about the legend, it is not particularly important. As long as he falls into my sight, one third of the chances will escape." Off," said Liu Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still shook his head: "There is still a chance for him to run. The legendary strongman has suffered a big loss and will definitely not go to the first I feel that there is no need to take this risk. Now that time is completely on our side, it will be stable for a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is in a certain area on the ancestral highland and asks: "Is the new Great Temple of the Highland God of War, is it built here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "When Clark answered, the voice was a little trembling." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy who made you have nowhere to go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark calmed down Said: "His current title is Yalatu, meaning the Lord of the Highlands, already the Pope of the Highland God of War."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yalatu, Highlands "The Lord?" Richard revealed a faint disdain and said: "He can quite give himself a title. It doesn't matter, I will let him see who the Highlands is!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, you want to..." Clark's voice shook even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said a little on the magic map and said, "Since we can’t fight the war, it’s better to fight a mortal war first. The old nest of God of War is at the end, and the right is to train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the division of the gods, the high gods are considered to be the gods of re-recovery, so they will have a priesthood similar to the Faroese god Lutheran. He laid the foundation in the ancestral highlands and became one of the gods of the barbarians. He is still weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard are constantly expanding, and the area currently controlled is only two hundred kilometers away from the Great Temple of the God of War. Only when Richard is not in Faro, the followers will control the scale of the war and stop the march to the Temple of the God of War. The pope of the self-styled Alato was also interested, and did not take the initiative to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the churches of the three goddesses, let them draw elite clerics, prepare for war, and prepare for this war only three days." After thinking about it for a while, Richard ordered: "Give the messenger, inform the god of war, the god of courage, the god of stability, and other gods who are in the chaos of the human race, and say that we are ready to fight against the gods of the highland gods and let them Also sent people to support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Support?" Gangde first. In the past wars, he personally slaughtered many of the priests of the human gods, saying that it is a bloody feud, so why do not feel that the church of God is willing to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is also selfish. The God of War is now a alien god. If we clean up its church and believers in the mortal world, then he will be in danger. At that time, it was the greatest temptation for the gods to do the same with a different priesthood and corresponding godhead. And they don’t have to exert much power to do this, so they will give some support." Smiling and explaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we still don't have three goddesses, where do they get their hands?" Gangde continued to ask. He has a good thing, that is, if you don't understand anything, you will ask it straight away, not afraid of being short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "The three goddesses are not fighting gods. Even if the high gods are in an endangered state, it is very dangerous to enter his kingdom. The gods will definitely Look at this point, and then grab the kingdom of the country after the battle has been settled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is this not cheaper than those shit gods?" solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "There must be a loss. The capture of the kingdom of God is a huge loss, even if it is the kingdom of God, it is the assimilation and maintenance in the early days." It takes a lot of energy. So when this war of the gods came down, no matter who got the kingdom of God, it will take a long time to fix it. Strong? That is the future."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
