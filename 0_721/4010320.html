			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the mother's nest added: "I need the total blood The amount may be a bit more, but as long as he stays with me for a month, every day I suck a little blood, it is enough to analyze the use, because the Zonghu is a god, with my current ability, can only resolve him ten One-third of the blood force, but this is enough for me to advance to the ninth order, and after I reach the tenth order, I can start the second stage of the analysis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can give you the Zonghu, but you must ensure that he cannot be killed, nor can he hurt his life or combat power." Richard made two requests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, master." The nest promised very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the brains come to pick up the tigers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition, Zonghu is promised Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard and Zonghu confirmed it, Zonghu just shrugged indifferently and said, "It’s just a little blood, even if you take it, let the brain split. Pick me up, to be honest, I am very interested in your cards, you don't mind letting me see, I naturally don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Zonghu and Richard have a more powerful soul bondage contract than magical slavery, and the water flower belongs to the same level. If it is not too far apart, Richard can feel his existence and even carry out consciousness and Perceived communication, but as the leading party of the soul contract, Richard can unilaterally block such communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Zonghu’s Oasis City alone. At this time, there was a small black spot in the distant sky, and the brain fell from the sky. Zonghu looked at the brain. Looks like a pair of eyes, revealing a playful smile, said to himself: "It's really a bit interesting, this is the so-called war behemoth Ahn'Qiraj Beetle Queen, let me think, as if I saw it in a dream that night. After this race...what is it, hell, my memory seems to have dropped a bit recently, I am still young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger’s self-talking, rushing down, directly grabbed the Zonghu, and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the brain of a few meters in length, Zonghu is like a little puppet, he can be divided into brains, even for the purpose Some expectations and curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember, this is a very terrible race. Their supreme worms can even grow up to 50 meters. Is it related to this race? It doesn't matter if I can see it." After the insect..." Zonghu thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is flying very fast. After a few hours, it has reached the depths of the turbulent land. There is a small nest that stands out. Spit the dense fog and cover the tens of kilometers of the circle in the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain directly casts the Zonghu into the thick fog, although it is thrown away from the air of more than ten meters, but the Zonghu has a shape and has been stable. Standing on the ground, after landing, Zonghu found that the thick fog around it was unusually heavy, and there was a sticky stagnation feeling when waving and waving, as if stirring in a large mass of paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense fog has a strong sense of shielding, and the perception of Zonghu can only detect less than ten meters in the fog, but he is very relaxed because He did not feel the danger of threatening life, and it was also related to Richard. Although he could not find the exact direction, he could feel the existence of a familiar soul power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Zonghu suddenly felt that his mind was slightly dizzy, and the power of the whole body was quickly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fog is poisonous." Zonghu was shocked and angry, but he had no time to do something, but he couldn’t figure out how to be physically fit. The poison is almost immune, so how to be so quick in this fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu doesn’t know, with the few drops of blood brought back by the twilight, the mother’s nest has added a toxic substance specifically for him in the fog, saying yes Poison is actually a substance with a strong sacred atmosphere. For ordinary people, this is even a fog that can cure diseases. For Zonghu, it is a targeted poison, almost weakening his resistance to the extreme. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Zonghu suddenly felt a fluster, it was not a fear of death, but a fear of some unknown evil instinct, the fog in front of him It violently rushed up, like boiling water, and then separated to the sides, as a hill-like nest slowly crawled out of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the Supreme Insect." Zonghu screamed, and then he found that the size of the mother's nest was bigger than the impression of the Supreme Insect, and it began to horrify. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he only saw the terrible race in his dreams, Zonghu knew that the race really existed, and even after the Supreme worm, he completely destroyed his ability. For Zonghu, it was the real death, and Faro. The mortal life is not killing him at all. He can only find ways to imprison him. Even the demise of the body can not stop his rebirth. This is also the greatest refuge he fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nest is sounding in Zonghu’s consciousness: "Don’t be afraid, I won’t eat you, although I really want to, now I just need a little Your blood, just a little bit, is nothing to you, so you don't have to worry about fear. I promised to be a master and won't hurt you, but in order to ensure that you can cooperate, I have to use a little bit. The means, well, let's start now, the host only gave me a month, a month, can be very long, but it is very short, remember, don't call."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." I don't know why, when Zonghu heard the mother's nest, it became even more alarmed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the nest in the middle of the fog, a dozen of tentacles that wrap the carapace are pulled out, and the Zonghu is dragged up and hung in the air, while the nest is moving. The huge body went to the Zonghu, spit out a few hollow hoses from the mouthparts and wrap them around Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the hose with the thickness of the thumb and the sharp front end, Zonghu was a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened." Richard's consciousness came from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu’s fear finally shocked Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest is a spiritual shock, directly rushing Zonghu into a coma, and then hurriedly replied: "Nothing, master, Zonghu is very good, he Just afraid of being sucked blood, the son of the gods, that is, the blood can be recovered after being drained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also true." Richard said, "but Zong Hu is actually afraid of taking blood, but I really didn't expect it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more extreme people, the more likely they are to have inexplicable personality defects, this is Zonghu. Character defects, afraid of blood." The mother's nest calmly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be." Richard's consciousness then went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest seems to relax, the mouthparts are wrapped around the Zonghu, and a few whistling sounds, deeply piercing the body of the Zonghu, then the hose begins to rhythmically relax, you can see a thick purple The black blood is pumped up along the hose and is inhaled by the mother's nest. Only when the rate of blood is sucked by the Zonghu, it is known that it takes less than five minutes for his whole body to be absorbed by the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Zonghu’s body quickly dried up and almost became a dry corpse, but the worm nested quickly and injected a large amount of high-concentration nutrients into the corpse. Tiger body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the tyrannical constitution of the son of Zonghu’s god is finally fully revealed, his body is expanding at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the nest is quickly injected. The substances are all absorbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In less than half an hour, Zonghu woke up, his face was rosy and full, and he couldn’t see any damage. However, he just opened his eyes and it was a cry. Hey, the hoses of the mother's nest began to creep again, pumping blood hard, and draining the tigers in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know this. He gave himself three months to start burying his head and drawing the makeup, while using the rest of the space for meditation to enhance the magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now needs to return Ninees and Agamemnon’s ten knights, so the knights on hand will have only twenty out of them, and With the help of Qi Qi, in the meditation to increase the magic, by the way to draw the structure, can also make six sets in a month, the construction of the knight is not only the level of combat power, in Noland, they It also has the power of deterrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days in a month, the mother’s nest sent Zonghu back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returning Zonghu apparently became silent, but he was originally a complete alien in Richard’s followers, and no one was willing to approach him and understand He, the only Tiramisu he had talked to, was also busy with the affairs of Richard Terri, almost not touching it, and Richard was buried in the world of magic and decoration, and did not notice the abnormality of Zonghu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that makes Li happy is that the mother’s nest has opened halfway to the ninth-order gate, but its eighth-order has not fully evolved yet. It still takes a long time to go to the ninth order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
