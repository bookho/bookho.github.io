			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha almost dismembered the Masters Association of the Sequoia Kingdom, but eventually gave the Master The benefits retained by the association are still two-thirds of the original. This interest is corresponding to the remaining ten great magisters of the association. In addition, the Masters Association still has ten great magisters, and the dying counterattack is bound to be fierce. Instead of this, it is better to incorporate the Masters Association into the new order. So when Theodore proposed a settlement, Richard immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage to the King Sequoia King’s room is second only to the Masters Association, and the political landscape within the Kingdom has been broken. Of course, Richard will not let such a good opportunity. He eventually returned only one-third of all occupied land, and the remaining two-thirds fell into Richard’s own pocket. These territories are added together, but they are equivalent to a powerful Marquis. <br /><br />############################################################################################################## Protest only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Duke of the Wolf skipped the Baron and directly awarded the title of the Count of Richard, all the protests vanished like the wind. As for the higher ranks, it belongs to the big aristocratic sequence. Even if it is not an independent aristocrat, it is necessary to register with the royal family and make a nominal oath of allegiance according to the law. At this time, neither Richard nor the royal family have this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard stood in the center of the Sequoia Kingdom and looked around, only to find that there were no opponents. If the three major dukes and the royal family have a war with themselves, Richard is very confident that he can completely defeat the opponent. However, the three Dukes and the royal family could not join hands. The Duke of Glasgow and the Duke of the Wolf also had a connection with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, it was time for the parties to the victory to share the interests. This is Richard's strength, but he does not know why, but suddenly feels a bit boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the King Sequoia King’s room, jumping down and watching the Master’s Association from the initial incomparable to the present, and then watching the people around them respect and fear. Looking at it, Richard suddenly felt that all this was funny and unreal. In the context of a kingdom, the war that has just passed is a key battle in determining the political landscape. However, if placed in the whole of Faro, this is just a partial war of a certain scale. What if you jump out of Faro? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sequoia King, the president of the Masters Association, they do not know what is the knight, do not know the existence of Noland, but do not know eternal With the Dragon of Time. So their struggles, their struggles, if they look at the higher level, are like jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard couldn’t laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stand on the level of eternal and time dragons, or even higher, and then look at what he does, Richard doesn’t know when he looks Is it the same ridiculous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee asked the followers to deal with the chaos after the war, and they returned to Noland with a lonely mood and the original spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spoils are usually metal and rare minerals. Because many of the nobles who participated in the vertical line stood on the side of the Masters Association, Richard rudely accepted the one that should belong to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the caravans and metal ingots brought back by the caravans have not been available to the Sequoia Kingdom, they are cheaper. Almost no aristocrats dare to protest. Now they are seeking to keep their position in the future. If that is enough to calm Richard's anger, it would be best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the transmission array, Richard actually had the illusion that he was still in Faro, but he was only transferred from one place to another, and his ears still faintly screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I arrived was still the Nolan Grand God official. Since she has worked with Richard, she has become very active. But when I saw Richard, Nolan was a slight flaw. However, she did not say anything at the time, but waited for the ten power-type fighters who came out of the transmission array. Only waved to these soldiers to bless the group vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, you look a little bit right?" Nolan looked at Richard and asked with some concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "Because of being young, I am depressed. Anyway, there are some problems. I will be fine for a while, let me ignore me." Now look at the things in the box and see what you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at Richard’s eyes and said seriously: Although we have a cooperative relationship between us, I feel that we are friends or other relationships. In short, gold coins are not everything. If I am willing, there will be many people willing to cooperate with me and let me share hundreds of them. The benefits of all things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that Nolan was telling the truth. If the great priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall wants to make money, there is a way. However, Nolan’s concern for him, at the moment, gave Richard a feeling of not knowing how to be good. He actually just wants to be quiet and calm down. After all, he is just a young man who is not 19 years old, but he has experienced much more than his peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the eyes of Nolan, Richard smiled a bit, shrugged his shoulders, and said helplessly: "My most beautiful Nolan sister, I just have some heart." Blocking, after a while, it will be natural. As for the reason, can you keep me secret? Come, let me see what I brought to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking, Richard hurriedly let the soldiers open the box, revealing the pile of forged black shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed at the metal ingots and said, "Look! These are yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nolan just glanced at the magic box and said to Richard: "No, you are still very different from the past. What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha back to Nolan, suddenly said: "Sister! This is the thing of our young people, sometimes it will suddenly be awkward, it is normal, just wait for you to grow up. You are older. "You don't understand the world of young people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan blushes on the face, shy and anger, anger: "Licha! Do you dare to say it again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out his tongue, and of course he wouldn’t be stupid enough to say it again. However, he finally succeeded in guiding Nolan's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the things brought back, in addition to the construction, Richard put all the things in his mind to Nolan, and whether she really needs it or not . Nolan, in the usual seriousness, counted the metal inside the magic box and decided to give Richard a price of two million. But when she looked up, Richard had already left the Eternal Dragon Hall, leaving only two free Archmonds left to deal with the follow-up affairs to look at her respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard came back this time, and Fu Shide is late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the floating island, almost everyone fell asleep. As soon as the old housekeeper got the news, he immediately came to the cloak. Richard did not sleep, went directly to the study, let the old butler send a few bottles of spirits to the study, and then let the old butler go to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, the wine that Richard wanted was sent to the study, and it was not the ordinary waiter who came in with the tray, but the old housekeeper himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting at the desk, Richard looked up in surprise and said to the old housekeeper: "It’s too late, go to sleep! The whole family depends on you. In order to function properly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper put the wine on the coffee table in the corner of the room, then hesitated, said to Richard: "Young master, you want Drink less, your body is tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will." Richard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler did not say anything and quit the study. He is very clear about his duty, and the words have already said that it is Richard's business to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old butler left, Richard poured himself a glass of wine, stood at the window and slowly drank. At this moment, Richard didn't think about anything in his heart, and he didn't know what to think. It was just an inexplicable irritability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full glass of spirits is unconsciously bottomed out. It was not until Richard felt a slight guilt that his heart gradually became more active. After all, during this period of Faro, Richard actually killed too many people. After more than a dozen battles, at least tens of thousands of people died under the death of Richard Butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the followers, in front of the fighting officers, more importantly, in front of the kingdom aristocrats, Richard is always talking and laughing, courteous, but all The genius of the master magic master. But when he was alone, he was still an 18-year-old young man. Among other giants, this age-old youth is the time of fresh clothes and anger, but Richard has long been in the depths of the plane, and now he is responsible for the entire family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he first entered Faro, he didn’t know what to do, even when he spoke before the ministry. Richard is not sneer, but in fact, because of tension, everything, every decision, he has to think twice, for fear of doing something wrong. At that time they were enemies at Faro, and they could not find a way home. The enemy was also unusually strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha knows that once he makes a wrong decision, or even if his luck is not good enough, he may die in Faro and the bones will be turned into The dust on the ectopic surface. In this case, the kind of pressure in my heart is really heavy and indescribable. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, until the heavy attack on the King Sequoia King, forcing the Masters Association to compromise, and using trade and construction to build a stream of money, also gained a strong and close interest In the league, Richard only put a little bit of tension in the snack. When he began to have a feeling of embarrassment and began to look back on the road he had traveled in the past two years, he suddenly found that the first-level level of his footsteps was tens of thousands of skeletons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a human being, watching countless lives in front of his own eyes, and inevitably there will be a feeling of his sympathy. In the meantime, several experiences of life and death have emerged from memory and are extremely profound. He didn't know which day he would become a member of these skeletons and became a stepping stone to the footsteps of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after the end of the first magical war, Richard could not help but start thinking about these problems. But there were still many aftermaths to deal with, and now, when he was alone in the previous study of Gordon, many questions began to emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what exactly is a plane war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, apart from war and conquest, the two planes can hardly find a third relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
