			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, the lakeside camp has become silent. In the day, both the soldiers and the captives were exhausted and entered the dream early. Only after the full food, the fast beast has become mentally awkward and takes on the responsibility of patrolling the vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic refilled, Richard ended his meditation today, stepped out of his tent and walked to the lake. There is already a sly figure standing by the lake, it is drifting sand. She seems to have little meditation, and her power is not recovered more slowly than Richard. At this moment, she quietly looked at the lake, do not know what to think about, the book of time hanging on the waist constantly emits a faint stream of light, intertwined with the mist of the lake surface, if dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over and asked casually: "What are you thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You And me." The light and hoarse sound of the sand is always so lethal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, he coughed a few times and wanted to hide his embarrassment. Flowing sand has an unusual appeal, and if it is not, Richard will not be embarrassed by these full of ambiguous answers. However, after several defeats, Richard did not want to give in this time, so he followed her topic: "What are you and me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his teeth and continued to ask: "What relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he exports, he feels a bit stupid. Obviously, this is equivalent to losing again in disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drifting sand turned to look at Lee deeply and said, "I am thinking, how many years can we still be."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other meaning in the words of quicksand, and it seems that there is nothing. Li sighed and said: "There should be many years, as long as we can survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a faint smile, saying: "If you If you want us to live, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is curious and said: "You seem to have confidence in me more than myself."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have a strange ability, the depth of the battlefield seems to be flat and transparent to you, and you have a mother nest..." The sand has intentionally paused. I said, "You also have me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sentence she said is correct, but some of them are particularly lethal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the sand in the moonlight, Richard always remembered her body. After all, he took control of the impulsive ** and then said seriously: "You have also read the information of our surrounding areas. From these materials, I found that the ordinary people here are not necessarily hostile to us, even There is also the possibility of cooperation with the nobility. One heart wants to destroy our gods who only have this position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsand replied: "That is of course. Our arrival It is destroying the rules of the plane itself, that is, threatening the foundation of the existence of the gods, they will inevitably want to get rid of us. The nobles are different, even if you rule the whole plane in the future, they can also be in your Find your place in the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded. "So, we actually have a high probability of finding the object of cooperation. I feel that there are two goals that can be tried. One is the Duke of the West, the Duke of the Wolf, and his belief is the ancestor worship. The other is the Earl of Oliver in the South. It is said that he has studied the dark magic of nearly two decades and has inextricably linked with the abyss. Some rumors from adventurers say that he secretly established a blood pool and often slaughtered them. Prisoners make sacrifices. From these signs, they must be trying to summon demons, which are by no means the product of the plane. They and the god of courage can never go to the same camp. Most notably, their territory The distance is not far away, but they are still there, indicating that they have strength, and the temple of courage cannot be easily destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. A tyrant, one Killing mad." Flowing sand hit the needle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. "We can only work with tyrants and murderers now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Be careful that they swallowed you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Then they will mostly break their teeth."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people laughed for a while, and Richard finally felt a lot easier. He stared at the smooth mirrored lake and said, "And, after I feel this plane, it seems that the speed of magic is slowing down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is normal, if it is our original destination low plane, the speed of power improvement will be slower. The greater the limit of power on the plane rule, the slower the power will increase. The main plane has almost no limit on strength. Therefore, it is called the main plane. In a sense, it is a waste of life to go to the lower plane, or to exchange resources for time. If you only want to be a strong, of course, the expedition in the main plane is faster. Something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, there are only two moons in this plane. Why can I use the power of the string when I use the Elf Sword? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand broke his head and shook his head: "I don't know this. There are too many mysteries between the planes. I only know a little common sense." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has a sigh of relief and said, "Okay, I am clear." Now, I have just got some new ideas, and my research on fireball has made a breakthrough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s another fireball! Your roast pig warfare The effect is good!" The sand is laughing, the smile on the lips is shallow, and under the reflection of the moonlight, she can't seem to be beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can improve even further! I can now control the magic delay to one second, that is, if I shoot Three fireballs, the falling points are the three vertices of the triangle, and then let them erupt at the same time through the magic delay..." Richard squatted down and kept writing on the lakeside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has not felt anything at the beginning, think deeply, and immediately changed his face. If Richard really can do the kind of control precision he said, then who is standing in the center of the triangle is not just as simple as roasting pigs. But the sand has not heard of the Master below the Magi, and can bring the magic of magic control to such a state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said and suddenly looked up into the distance and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
