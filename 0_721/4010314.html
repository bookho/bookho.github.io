Although there is a lot of pain in the bottom of the body, but compared with the horror feeling that seems to have only one head left, he almost cried, this is alive. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being examined by Richard, he immediately turned over and climbed up. Although there were many painful places, it was not very intense, and the limbs were still active, but only The hands and feet are cold and numb, and it feels very heavy, like being crushed by heavy objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several strong people around can see that all the ambitions of this guard have been destroyed by Richard, and on the other hand, his injury In fact, it is much more serious than the surface wound. There are signs of necrosis in the flesh and blood of several important parts of the joint. If there is no such thing as Nolan’s large-scale priest’s treatment, even if the injury is raised, the grade may not exceed grade ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Cardiff resisted his anger and shouted to Richard: "Who are you, why do you want to hurt my guard, if you can’t give me a satisfaction? The reason, don't think so easily today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "You don't even know who I am, dare to me. "Hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s face flashed a sigh of relief, but glanced at Neris around Richard, and when he looked at Richard, his eyes had changed. It was quite complicated, and sneered and said: "Which big man I am, it turned out to be Archimonde's Richard, but Lina is the knight of the Marquis of Gordon, when will it become your follower, let one As a follower, you are really a prestige. In addition, here is Faust, you blatantly kill another aristocrat's guard. Why, by the identity of the royal builder, how do I remember that you have not Obtained the title of the official aristocracy of the Holy Alliance, but now it is just a civilian. According to the law, civilians are wounded. I have to bear the corporal punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to Cardiff at all, but reached out to Lina and said, "Lina, come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Long went to Licha according to his words. This time no one dared to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Cardiff wants to use strong, it’s one thing to deal with a big magister, when the big magister has a melee force, That is another matter completely. When there is a four-prince and a group of royal war knights standing on the side, the use of force has become a stupid thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next time you come across this kind of thing, don't rush to desperately, your life is very precious, remember to take it slowly, wait for me to come Even if I come late, I will let those who dare to move you double the repayment, no matter who the other party is and which family they belong to." Richard said faintly, but this made the Earl of Cardiff and the faces of all the people. It became even more ugly, which was a red/naked/naked contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a slamming sound, it turned out that the injured guard fell to the ground again, this time it was really too much injury, fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, you injured my guard, how to deal with this matter." Earl of Cardiff asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a picture of Lina who wanted to speak, pulled her behind her, and then asked an elegant smile to the Count of Cardiff: " Yes, excuse me, who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flush on the face of Captain Cardiff, but he still endured anger and said, "I am Tucson. Count of Cardiff, the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "The Tucson family is famous, but who is the Count of Cardiff."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Cardiff rushed to the top of his head and yelled: "Licha,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察扬头Smiling, looking at him without hesitation: "Why, I want a duel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s arrogance was immediately extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, you hurt my guard, you have to give me a confession." Cardiff tried to speak in a calm voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also put away a smile and stared at Cardiff, saying: "You put the dog out to bite, I have not killed the dog is very kind. You won't be really stupid enough to think that you can refer this matter to the Privy Council. Of course, if you like, then I will accompany you to the end, and finally remind you that a guy I have never heard of can't represent the Tucson family, so Don't take the name of Tucson out of the scary. In addition, Fausal is not the back garden of your family. I believe that no one here has the guts to perjury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Cardiff’s face was white, and Richard’s last words let him know that the other party had at least witnessed most of the previous process. He also knew that if he seriously pursued it, he could not take it, but this kind of thing If you go to the Privy Council, it is not the one who sees more reason, but the result of the competition behind the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sentence that is damn correct. In this case of injury, the Tucson family may be able to regulate Archimonde, but it does not mean The Count of Cardiff can absolutely suppress Richard, not to mention the presence of a Nyres Prince, even if the firm is standing on his side, it is not so easy to reverse black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Cardiff had to scream: "Put this waste up, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slow." Richard said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Cardiff's face was blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just wanted to start with my people, so I want to go, I don't think I have such a good speech."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif smirked and said, "Okay, let me see how you are not talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He turned his head and said: "Nyris, there are boutique exhibition halls and auctions upstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has always relied on leisurely On the stair railings, I nodded when I heard the words. It was a matter of knowing what to ask. The two came here for the small auction, but now he certainly played the show together, adding a little and pure face and adding: " It is said that there will be sacrifices and rare magic materials at this auction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a sacrifice, it is rare." Unexpected expression, then looked back at Cardiff and said, "The guy behind you just got rid of Lina's pocket money, don't you forget it so soon."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged aristocrat who was named by Richard unnaturally moved his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only 200,000, I will pay her 400,000." Gardoff sneered, reaching out and taking a palm-sized parchment from his pocket to see The light brown texture should be the accounting vouchers commonly used by the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that 200,000 is just her pocket money. Is your ear in the water?" Richard looked at Cardiff's face as he gradually became purple because of the continuous provocation, and finally revealed his tooth decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always has an elegant smile, and his eyes on Cardiff’s eyes reveal a trace of disdain and malice that provokes him. “I just heard someone say that Kemond is a poor ghost, so people who must say this will not mind burning money with a poor ghost. Since there is an auction, we will compare it to see who is the real poor, how? Whoever wins the auction will have more money, and whoever wins, whatever it is, will be donated to the Eternal Dragon Hall. How about, Viscount Cardiff, dare you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Count of Cardiff." Gadif roared and corrected Richard, and both eyes were bloodshot. "Well, just do what you said, but what the loser said." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in an understatement: "Gambling is a compulsory course for every nobility. It’s nothing more than a face-lifting and a wealthy woman. Then we have both good. The bet is three million gold coins, plus two slaps, how about, Baron Cardiff, you dare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, and, I am Count Cardiff." Cardiff whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif has not seen Richard himself before, and he did not recognize him at first sight because of Richard’s appearance and information on the image of the Dark Blue Sorcerer today. The difference is too big, and Gardiff did not count Richard in the matter of planning Lina. For a big magician, especially the talented dragon mage like Lina, her personal will is Most importantly, the Archimonde family's binding on her is almost negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not prevent Cardiff from being extremely abhorrent to Richard now, not only because he has injured his guard, but the elegant and beautiful young man in front of him is simply a The typical Archimonde, rude, arrogant, and savage, began to scream his anger from the first sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard makes another bet, Cardiff may hesitate, anyway, there is no good reason to be with a royal constructor. There is a direct conflict, but the competition for wealth is a game entirely in the rules, and in this field, Cardiff will never fear an Archimonde, even if the name of Archimonde is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
