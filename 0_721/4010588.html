Although Nolan can only insist on one hour, but for Richard, an hour has passed. Too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the enemy who had been chasing himself all the way, Richard’s lips floated with a vague smile, and the murderousness disappeared. He slowly raised his right hand and In the former one, the army immediately moved forward and turned into a torrent of steel, rolling past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the two sides is roughly equal, and the average quality of the mutant elves is even higher than that of Richard’s army. If the advantage is said, it is that the strong has a comprehensive advantage. In addition, even in the case of a relatively high or even slightly lower level, relying on sophisticated equipment, Richard's knights can also defeat opponents in one-on-one situations. The biggest advantage of the mutant elves: the comprehensive suppression of the forest will, At this moment, Nolan offset the majority, and the other half, at least in the forefront of the position, was offset by the holy unicorn. When the knights rushed to the mutant elves, the team of magicians and priests kept giving them Casting a variety of gain magic, each knight on the front line has at least one gain effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you say the advantage, Richard’s biggest advantage is that he is an army, and the opponent is just a fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overcome the suppression of the will of the forest, and the ability of the commanding of the battlefield is fully exerted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the army is like a diastolic petal, with seven petals, expanding in a fan shape, the tip of each petal, the knight, the elite The Knights of the Sui Feng, the Knights of the Sui Feng, the Royal Guards and the Dukes of the Irons, the orderly order, the formation is not chaotic, a large number of knights constitute a sharp edge, easily smashed the front of the mutant elves, follow-up fighters and knights Layers hit the opponent, expanding the breakthrough, and then the soldiers began to harvest the mutated elves that had been disrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lin Haizhong, it was not suitable for large-scale corps operations, but under the command of Richard’s fine-grained, an old tree did not become an obstacle, but instead It became a natural fortress and fortification. An independent small army ran up and down on the battlefield, and split into a combined attack. It constantly divided a local mutated elf, and once again, split the next batch after killing the light. The second Richard was prepared, and the toxins and acids of the mutant elves were almost ineffective before the fine magic armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fierce battlefield, a dark and mutated elf is squatting on the big tree. Instead of participating in the battle, the third eye in front of the forehead overlooks the entire battlefield. In the rear forest camp, the guardian elves are tribes. The elders and black robes are looking at the magical images in front of them, and everything that the mutated elf sees will be revealed in the magical images. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the magic image is playing a close-up, a mutant elf suddenly bites on the arm of a Knight, and the result is only in the simple and heavy arm. A few teeth were left on the nail, but its full-mouth teeth broke down a lot. Then it was a bite-smelling acid sprayed onto the knight, and the acid liquid etched a large piece of white foam, but an elite The squadron knight flew over from the side, and the sword smashed the head of the guardian elf. The spurting blood washed away the acid on the armor of the squadron. As a result, the surface of the armor was just an inconspicuous pit, and wanted to etch it. Wear, at least a dozen mouthfuls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes are silent, and the elders who guard the elves are looking at each other in uneasiness. They never thought that there would be such a perverted armor, Greenson The plane lacks metal, and they have never thought about the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One party is the army, one side is the herd, and the result of the war, in the eyes of the real general, has been doomed from the start of the war, but the final casualties are still unexpected After more than half of the casualties, the mutant elves suddenly retreated and counted afterwards. They dropped more than 4,000 bodies, and Richard’s troops suffered only one hundred casualties. More than half of them were ordinary warriors, and the high-end combat power was almost intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number makes the elders of the guardian elves fall into a long silence, and the black robe is silent from beginning to end, posing in front of them is a very real problem. Who will command, not to say that no one can be found, that is, with a suitable general, the mutated elves are almost undirected, and they are only able to understand the simple command of advancing and retreating at this moment in the brain that is instinctively filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After simply cleaning the battlefield, Richard buried the fallen soldiers in the forest, and the army continued to advance deep into the forest, but the holy unicorn was separated from the army. Returning to the rear alone, about half a day later, a worker bee appeared on the edge of the battlefield. It flew directly to the body of a mutant elf and dragged it to the forest. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of worker bees poured into the battlefield, and they mutated the elves and The corpses of the guardian elves were all collected and sent to the rear. The nucleus of the nest was now ten kilometers away and began to swallow these bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in the consciousness of Richard, the nest is constantly transmitting the data, the resolution of the guardian and the mutant is rising, and the guardian has exceeded 300%, and the Variation Wizard has crossed the 100% barrier and continues to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard let the mother's nest continue to eat, and then began a series of moves to the army, he is ready to give the guardian elves a good lesson, let them know what a real war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Richard is still advancing steadily and firmly. The soldiers are used to the roaring explosion and the loud noise of the old trees. Lin Hai is forcibly A thoroughfare was opened. Above the passage, there was a sign of instability in the suppression of the forest will. Richard mobilized some of the knights and knights, and matched the two hundred Nyres and Agamemnon. Elite, leaving Alize to command the whole army, and then with this five-scale super elite, rushed into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple fights against the forest will, and does not need to clean up the old trees. This unit travels extremely fast and reaches hundreds of kilometers in a few hours. As a result, he encountered a guardian elf unit consisting of a war-old tree and more than a dozen war trees. Richard was unceremonious and took the lead to enter the enemy line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a one-sided slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old war tree was under the siege of the powerful metamorphosis of Richard, Nyris, Agamemnon, and Splash, and failed to support it for a long time. Then, the war process really turned into a massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, hundreds of guardian elves had only a dozen lucky guys who managed to escape, and Richard was harvesting the trees of war ancient trees and war tree people. After the heart, he led the team to find the feeling. The murderous troops continued to move forward. Only after a few big circles around the week, but nothing was obtained, they returned to the big forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest camp is dead, the black robe is hard to keep calm, and the blackness of the whole body indicates that he is in extreme anger, the magic image stays in the last two At the moment when the war tree was slain, this unit was originally one of the troops that set foot at the scheduled place. The black robes themselves came up with an ambush, because Richard’s marching route is almost a straight line, even the goblin can Predicting his next direction, the black robe people have mobilized three sets of troops, ready to assemble on the road of Richard's must, then set aside, quietly waiting for Richard to enter the ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was that he did not expect that Richard suddenly gathered in a sharp and violent rush, and the result happened to be the first ambush force, and it was completely smashed, so that the latter The two units did not need to be assembled, and the black robes were ambushed and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the guardian elves were all silent. They didn’t dare to speak or know what to say, but the war tree in the magical image was simply killed, but they secretly raised an unprecedented idea and lost. With the advantage of the forest will, the forest camp can block the army of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes are also thinking about this problem. After a long time, he decided to move the forest camp and intercept the army of Richard on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Lin Hai is still the same noisy, and the army of Richard continues to advance at a constant speed, no matter what obstacles are there. Will be completely flattened, in the roar of the explosion, countless old trees were blown down, and some of the rules of Richard can be felt from the wind through the forest, if the world tree and the tree of life are still angry Then, at this moment they have quieted down and even started to have fear. This fear comes from the two tree of life closest to Richard at the moment, which is less than a thousand kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the forest camp is slow, but the promotion of the army of Richard is not too fast, and after that raid, there seems to be no new movements. The forest camp finally arrived at the destination in time, and laid roots in front of the army of Richard. The elders of the guardian elves finally breathed a sigh of relief, because the combat power of the forest camp was less than half of the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes finally opened their mouths, and the cold voices showed strong confidence and determination, and even swung their arms down for a footnote: "This war, It will end here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is set up, then it’s time for Richard to vote for the net, but it will be so smooth, the elders of the guardian elves I always feel a little uneasy, but I can't think of anything. Compared with the war in front of me, the battle between the tribes in the past is like a child's game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard also said to the generals of Nyris, Agamemnon and His Majesty: "This war should be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said this, no one knew the thoughts in Richard’s mind, but then a huge shadow slowly passed over the heads of the people, they looked up and watched When the giant star is floating in the air, the powerful people also perceive that Richard's holy unicorn is standing on the back of the star. With the holy unicorn, the star can move freely in the forest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
