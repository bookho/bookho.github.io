The magical sounds interfere with, and the special training they receive can also overcome the natural deterrence of fire magic and other wild beasts. However, the roar of the hundreds of muskets, the intensity of the fire, the smoke of the smoke is much stronger than the sound of the general magic. Many horses have stood up, and the horses of the kingdom immediately smashed out. More horses are instinctively slowing down and even starting to circle in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of knights were taken from horseback, and their end is not dead. On the whole, the most deadly is not casualties, but the speed of the charge! The distance of tens of meters is not enough for these reloading knights to accelerate again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of flying axe flew out of Richard’s army, and they were accurately placed on the head of the kingdom who was busy gathering the rider. They put down hundreds of rides. Then the firearmsman had thrown the first fired gun, took the second rifle on his back, and quickly fired the shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a roar, and dozens of kingdom knights are falling. More importantly, the horses that had been comforted were more shocked. Not only failed to charge, but also stopped the second wave of kingdom knights attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of the Knights of the Kingdom, and the most aggressive offensive, resolved. Although there are still some highly skilled knights who bypassed their companions and successfully rushed into Richard's battlefield, the effect of the rushing array was far less than expected. In the first row of Richard, the barbarian heavy shield infantry. Although the insatiable barbarians couldn't stop the reloading of the Cavaliers, they couldn't continue to go deep into the army and had to fall into the same battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle turned into a glue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku’s face is blue and green, and the deputy head is also blue-faced. Zaku did not think that the soldiers who were originally slaves were so powerful, and that this army was not as simple as it appeared on the surface. Just look at the magic and magical brilliance of the frontline warriors, you can imagine how many gods and mages are hidden in the team! If you look at it with power, you must definitely exceed the list he got. Such a number of priests and mages are slaves and can immediately become war machines! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s the bard in the Richards team! The coverage of the Elf Warsong is 50 meters in a square, which exceeds the level description of him. From the contribution to the overall combat power, he even pursued Iraq and Russia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head is stupid in the bottom of my heart. The other party has such a level of Master and God's official group, how does Zaku think that the god official group in Inner Mongolia can compete with it, and Bai/Idiot knows that it is impossible to use quantity as a power comparison. It is only the radiant battle sergeant in the opponent's line that can completely overwhelm the entire sect of the inner sect. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zaku immediately crossed the deputy head of the order, in addition to guarding the five hundred knights of the Chinese army, all the cavalry capable of attacking were sent out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides were killed and killed on the vast plains, but Zaku felt a little bad with the sharpness of a big magician, but he did not understand where it was. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head of the group was staring at the thousands of humanoid knights who had not moved at the time of Richard’s lineup, and their eyes continued to twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the beginning of a nightmare. The earth suddenly vibrated slightly, and the smoke rose from a distance. The entire five troops appeared on the edge of the battlefield from all directions and were rushing to the side at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head of the Knights of the Kingdom did not have to look at it, and knew that this must be the army of Richard. However, it was less than ten minutes from the start of the war, except that more than an hour before the war, Richard let the ambush move to the battlefield. But how is this possible? If this is the case, is Richard not a god of omnipotence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the gods, and it’s not omnipotent and omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the deputy head wanted to do something, Richard suddenly moved! He led a thousand knights, forming a torrent of steel, and rushing straight to the middle of Zaku! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were enemies of the coalition forces on the way, but the two armies confronted each other. The knights of the coalition forces were instantly cut down, even the kingdom knights were not Richard. The enemy of these humanoid knights! In addition to the power gap, the gap in equipment is also fatal. Most of the weapons of the coalition forces were directly cut off by the prickly assassin in the hands of the humanoid knight in the first round of confrontation, and then the humanoid knight's assassination axe rounded, and then left a terrible blood trough on the opponent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense line composed of hundreds of coalition cavalry is as soft as tofu, easily torn by Richard, and the speed of the charge is not stagnant. Gangde and the Ogre Magi are the two arrows of the charge. Sometimes they are too lazy to play fancy movements with each other. They will shoot the weapons directly and will bring the knights who are blocking the road to the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thousands of humanoid knights rushed together, they rushed to the sky and let the deputy heads who participated in the national war suffocate! In the middle of the humanoid knight, Richard is very eye-catching. It seems that thousands of people are just the background of him alone. That is the momentum that the real superiors will have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hundreds of meters away, Richard reached out and pointed at Zaku, then thumb down and took a cut throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku’s face suddenly turned into a pig liver color. He rolled over and pulled the staff in his hand, ready to wait for Richard to enter the magic range. The powerful eight-level magic teaches Richard. No matter what, the only one who knows nothing about life and death can't change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the deputy head is not willing to let Richard approach this way, if the sprinting knight battle is not blocked, it will directly run over from the Chinese army, then It is a disaster at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head of the group bears a slap in the face, the whole body is full of radiance, the whole body is swollen in a circle, and then with dozens of riding and guarding, the death meets Li Check out the front, go upstream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Sanctuary? Not a simple guy!" Richard smiled and smiled, then raised his voice and shouted: "Rolf! Give it to you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured!" The former Sanctuary Swordsman saw that the deputy head of the team must have fled, but with the scrolls of war, even Luofu dared to The deputy head of the Knights of the Kingdom said in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two sacred fields, Tami, you are going to entangle one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tami screamed, and the whole body screamed and greeted the sacred knight on the side of the deputy head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head! There is a sanctuary!" Gangde is eager to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not want to give him this opportunity, and replied: "Let the knights pile him up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde felt sorry, but the sanctuary who was named by Richard changed his face. He looked at the hundred humanoid knights who suddenly turned into a sharp-pointed formation. The mouth twitched and almost wanted to turn around and escape! It is also a battle, and has been on the battlefield many times. Naturally, I know how powerful my power is. I am surrounded by knights who are even more powerful than the kingdom knights, and the actions are mutually compatible. It is definitely a life of nine deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich!!" A bleak snoring sounded over the battlefield, it was the power of magic, and there would be such a huge volume. For a moment, everyone’s eyes fell on the sound of this snoring, where Zaku held his staff and the whole person hovered in the air! The great magister shouted: "I am here, come and fight with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacu gestures to all the cavalry guarding himself and the other two great magisters Leave yourself, float in the air alone, and look down on the battlefield. In this battle, his meaning is very clear, and the magician's duel to the magician will not let his men intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha also called with the huge volume of magic expansion: "You are a big magician! Can we both go up together?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku’s mouth sag, almost 90 degrees to the chin, and screamed in the sound of the ancient singularity: “No problem! I am the red robe elder Zach of the Masters Association! Except you, You can choose one of your partners and fight with me! Even if it is Luofu, there is no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha laughed and said: "Running sand, we are on!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the sand, Zaku was angry: "Richard!! You only call a little girl up, is it insulting me? She only Twelve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has instigated the unicorn and rushed straight to Zaku, laughing with a long smile: "Old things, after you survive Let's talk about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacu no longer talks with Richard, and when Lee enters the magic range, he immediately begins to mourn the spell. The speed of his curse is fast and urgent, but it is clear and abnormal. An eight-level magic will appear when he sees it for three seconds. The other two great magisters met, and they were both shocked and embarrassed. They always knew that Zaku’s strength was good, but he never thought that he had reached such a realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard made everyone stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a book with a bronze cover and flipped it open, but he waved it as a bursting fireball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instant Seven Magic? ! Doesn't that mean that Richard has been able to release nine levels of magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Zacul’s eyes are round, and there is so much inconsistency in the intelligence that has not been received beforehand. He quickly interrupted the singer to half of the eight-level magic, and began to constantly add defensive magic to himself. The magic defense he had prepared was only able to deal with the magic below the sixth level, just in response to Richard's 13th-level wizard. But who wants to get Richard's wave is a burst fireball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of the fireball is different from the fire of the ordinary fireball. There are many bright yellow flames inside, no matter the temperature or the power, it is higher than the ordinary fireball. Much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first burst of fireball has not yet passed, and Richard continues to flip the book in his hand, and it’s two bursting fireballs one after the other, almost Connected into a line, flying to Zaku! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
