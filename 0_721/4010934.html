			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people are shocked to see that it is not impossible to conquer the dragon, but think To conquer the dragon in such a short period of time, there is simply no way to accomplish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was completely overwhelmed by the abyss of the abyss, which is a condition that no one else can have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to say with pleasure: "You, you have seen it now, these dragons have been completely tamed. Half of them will enter the point redemption system, another Half will be sold directly. If you want to have a dragon, the auction in three days is the best chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many strong and lords are away Before going there, I was still reluctantly watching these dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dragons have legendary combat power, which is a great help for legendary powerhouses and aristocratic giants. Those who havetily left are not necessarily interested in the dragons, they are likely to be preparing for work. Three days are too short, and we must hurry to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no face flies out from the dragon's hole, the night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights in the residential area are gradually extinguished and people begin to fall asleep. Looking from afar, Richard's lab is still bright and bright, and it is very eye-catching in the night. And no face knows that this light will always be bright until dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next week, Richard will not have much time to sleep and eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly sighed and said softly: "I can only do this for you. Work hard, there is not much time left for you.. ...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t work without night, he even threw Norland’s politics aside. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Archimonde exchange system became more and more known, even the voice of the Holy Tree dynasty that advocated the battle against Archimonde was much smaller. Now, there are nearly a hundred strong people who are fighting for the points. At this time, they are going to play Archimonde. Isn't it just that they can't compete with these strong people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you rob all of Archimonde, it doesn't work. The strong people value the points so much. The real purpose is to be the super fifth-order angel king Midarun. Of course, other redemptions are actually good. The strongmen mostly look at reconfigurable equipment and various equipment, and many of the lords are shocked by the massive horses, the knights and the military supplies. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Archimonde opened its core resources to the entire continent with a redemption system, many people found that they lost the reason for the occupation of Archimonde. Since you can use the points to change things, why bother to get it by war? What's more, even if they want war, can they win the game? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people quickly developed the mystery of the Archimonde exchange system, and others wanted to try to build the same system. However, they have no choice but to find that their system is completely unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually quite normal. These families may be able to come up with a lot of supplies and various offers to attract the initial popularity, but how can they get the Super Five? The structure of the order? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Archimonde has announced that a Midrande suite will be on the redemption list every month. In addition, no matter the wild series knights, or the enchanted weapons produced by the mother nest through the flesh furnace, they are impossible to copy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was working in the lab, the dragon plane finally accumulated enough power to carry out a long-lost invasion. When the dragons appeared, the strong people who waited for the flowers and thanked broke out a burst of cheers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are full of winning confidence to enter Faro, this time they have sent several tribes, the number has directly doubled, and The average combat power has also improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the dragons rushed out of the five sè masks, they suddenly found that the number of human strongs on the opposite side was more than three times that before, and they were all red. Eyes, as if staring at life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, the dragon that is determined to win is beaten back. However, the strong human beings feel that the meaning is still unfinished, and the new joiners are too many, so that everyone can get a lot less points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has been working, not even knowing that a big battle has taken place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his workbench, there is a special magic clock with a countdown time. The countdown to this magic clock is the time when Richard’s child is scheduled to be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes tired, Richard will also look at the magic clock, so there is power invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the child was born, Richard must be next to him. It is not only to witness this moment, but also to enable him to come to the world smoothly. Although Cocoa continues to take life potions to improve vitality, her original constitution is too weak and is likely to be dangerous in production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro’s time passed quickly, and another month passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of Richard was faster than the scheduled time, not only made the third kit, but also re-made Miladaren's shoulder armor. At the same time, Richard also completed the core array of fifty sets of wilderness series knights, and completed all the third and fourth order construction. The fifth-order illusion stealth has also been completed, and it is estimated that when the next exchange period is over, someone will want to exchange for the fifth-order construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a busy day, the special magic clock suddenly rings! Richard looked up and looked at the time marked on the magic clock, then put down the magic pen in his hand and walked out of the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he passed through the portal and returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Rose Castle, Cocoa is sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, flipping through a history book and occasionally looking out the window. Her abdomen is high and up, half the size of a normal pregnant woman, but her body is not fat, but it looks a bit thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid is helping her to comb her long hair at the moment, combing and saying: "You said, will your Highness come back in time?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coco smiled slightly, his hand stroking his stomach, and said with a little laziness: "He is very busy, even if he can't come back, there is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s not fair to you..." the maid complained, "You don't know, some people in the castle are hard to hear, they say you rely on it." The relationship with His Royal Highness has the position of today, hey! Those guys are jealous, they have the ability to be born, they just want to, they still can’t see them at all! When the children are born, you can’t let them go. There are some guys who are even more hateful, they actually... actually said that this child is not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough." Coco drank the maid and said, "These words can be said, but you can't say. Your Royal Highness is not something you can imagine. If you let him hear these rumors, it is possible to bring you They all rushed out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress was shocked. She is from the side of the cocoa family, just rubbing the side of the nobility, and even better than the civilians who mix better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cocoa became pregnant, the old housekeeper asked her to choose a maid from her own family, which is also familiar to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to work in the Black Rose Castle, this maid can be said to be a step in the sky, not only can see many of the Archimonde family, but also There are still many strong people to the transit station of Faro. In case her luck is good someday, she will be seen by a strong sanctuary, and a life will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​this maid, cocoa is actually very clear. After all, two people have known each other since childhood. When she was sent to the floating island of Archimonde, the mentality was similar to that of the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the cocoa status was a companion candidate at that time, a little higher than the maid, but also limited. She didn't even think about becoming a partner of Richard. This is the best result for any girl in the side family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there have been a lot of things going on...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the past Cocoa's heart is very complicated, and there is a feeling that it is unclear. The past of that scene, now remembered, seems to be a big dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how many twists and turns in the middle, it is indeed the best ending for her. She can feel that the little life in the belly is greedily taking her vitality and growing at an incredible speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in two or three days, it will be born. At that time, will Richard come back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa smiled bitterly and then looked at the scenery outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Richard doesn’t come back, there’s nothing. When the child is born, her obligation as a partner is completed. At that time, Coco was ready to hand over the choice to Richard. It is up to Richard to stay with him, continue to take care of the children, or receive a generous reward, and then return to his hometown to start a new life, which is decided by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
