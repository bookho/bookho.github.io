			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling the Battle Tree Fortress is a three-person decision, Nyris and Agamemnon expanded too fast in the past, but also owed a foreign debt, and urgently needed an income to pay off debts. Of course, although their debts are very impressive, they are not comparable to Richard’s shocking figures. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the three people agreed to annihilate the harvest of the three elves, and the income of the tree of life was in accordance with the previous agreement, Nyris and Aga. The door farmers should account for one third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has roughly calculated that the plundering of the Elf tribe has contributed to the wealth of four top offerings, and the harvest of the Tree of Life is in two top offerings. Above, this has solved the debt problem of Richard Xiaoban, and the war is the source of riches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the chance of plundering is only one-off, and the harvest of the tree of life is far less than that of capture, and the income of cutting down the tree of life is not as good as once. The harvest of the Jin Dynasty, if you know that you can't keep the tree of life of the tribes such as the thorns, Richard will not do the work of fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set a profit distribution plan, which means that Greenson’s war has come to an end, and Richard has already disabled the main force of the guardian elf and put himself The tree of life that has been obtained is swept away. It is now known that the nearest tree of life is more than 6,000 kilometers away from the base of advancement. Richard does not think that it is a good deal to fight the past, and his own army is very difficult to hide, and the guardian elves are mostly hidden. You won't be in the same place, just find a place to hide, you can hardly find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard decided to take over, leaving a moderate amount of troops in Greenson to develop slowly, the parent nest and the Golden World tree are in this plane, time is definitely standing On the side of Richard, the green forest with stable situation is only collecting all kinds of resources, and it can stably harvest 3 million gold coins every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a series of trivial things. A lot of rare materials harvested from Green Forest need to be shot. Richard also has to consider the progress of other planes. Time and energy, but have to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Greenson war, Richard can be said to have harvested huge wealth, but he is not happy at all, he is gone, she is brilliant However, I do not know how many regrets, Richard did not protect the life tree of the night, and finally survived less than half of the Eternal Night Elf, and Mei Lin, this beautiful elf who is actually regarded as a daughter now does not know where, Even if she almost died under her hand, Richard did not hate her. She always thought that there was something in the body of Merlin who was manipulating her. After returning to triumph, Richard never gave me any more, and Nolan was there. Positioning Mei Lin's position is just a matter of sacrifice, but at least at this time, Richard is not ready to chase her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you meet on the battlefield one day, you will talk about it in the future. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; next troops to rest reorganization, ready to slowly withdraw from Green Forest, since Iwaki accelerant practical, as well as rock wood as the main raw material of new powder manufacturing success, forward base The rock-and-soof rock piled up finally has a market. Now there are six thousand soldiers in the base city, divided into two shifts, and the logging is carried out in turn. The border of the forest slowly shrinks back, although I don’t know how long it will take to cut down the forest, but now the explosive Just a roar, it is a small bag of gold coins to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the forest, a lonely elf is walking, her hair is messy, and the tight leather has ripped a few cracks to reveal the flesh and blood. The wound, this beautiful face is now a little bloody, a wound almost across her entire left face, she struggled to walk under a big tree, sitting on the back against the big tree, gasping with a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Mei Lin, after inexplicably assassinating Richard, she has been wandering in the forest, and now she is extremely weak, without the charm of a forest woman. In the past, the bottomless eyes are now clear and momentarily blurred. Through the pupils, we can see that two forces in the deepest part are fighting and killing, taking turns to prevail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the power of the gray gradually took advantage, and Melin felt that her head was getting more and more heavy, and a drowsiness was unstoppable. Suddenly she pulled the dagger from her waist and slowly made a wound on her left arm. The severe pain made her face twist, and the cold sweat rolled down, but finally woke up, expelled her sleep, and took a little rest. Mei Lin stood up and found a few grasses in the forest, mixed together and smashed, and then applied the grass juice on the dagger. This is a very simple formula, and the mixed grass juice will not cause the wound to enter the wound. Suffering from the pain, people or animals with weak will tend to faint directly, and Melin relies on the pain caused by this grass juice to keep herself awake, because she knows that once she is overwhelmed, her body Will be occupied by another will, so that some of the actions that make you regret your life, such as the sudden assassination of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recognized the direction and dragged her weak body forward, she is not sure where she is, only know if she is When I walked in the direction, I would find the base city of Richard. Melin herself could not tell why she was going to the base city. All her will was against another will, so that there was only one thought left in her heart. See Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of Linhai, the forest camp is about to return to the place of departure. At this moment, there are only two war trees and more than a dozen war trees in the forest camp. The other trees and elves have returned to their tribes. In the top floor of the forest camp, there are only the proverbs and the other elders. Apart from them, there are only three surviving elders who have returned to their respective tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the elder elder is standing in front of an altar, with both hands pressed, a natural mana constantly pouring into the altar, floating on the altar with magical images, inside It is Mei Lin who struggles. As the elders continue to inject natural forces, Mei Lin’s footsteps are correspondingly slower and slower, but when she looks down, Mei Lin actually pulls out the dagger and looks for it. A wounded product, a stroke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elder snorted, his face suddenly pale as paper, and then slowly recovered, he glanced at the unyielding Merlin in the magical image, his eyes exposed Cold, angry and greedy, but the strange look just passed away, it was suppressed, and the solemn solemnity was restored. He suddenly turned his head and said to an elf standing in the corner: "You come over."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf came to the altar and glanced at Merlin in the image. The look was complicated. This young elf is actually the Kara of the Yongyao tribe. I don’t know what to do in the war. When I escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the proverbs looked at Kara with a cold look and said, "The things you bring will not be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being stared at the eyes of the elders, the heart of the karaoke is a cold, and quickly said: "There is no problem, Mei Lin’s hair and blood are hard to find the opportunity to collect. How dare I lie about this big event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang elders nodded and looked at Melin in the magical image and said, "I hope you are like As said, she is difficult to control, and now she is alert. Even if there is a powerful mystery that God has given, she can only slowly consume her will, but looking at her direction is to go to the door of the devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kara looked at the struggling Melin in the magical image, especially when she used her dagger with painful grass juice to cut herself to keep her face awake. Changeable, sometimes fearful, sometimes blame, can not help but hate to say: "She would rather die with Richard, this **."<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara said, and Ai Ai looked at the proverb elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as she is in my hands, I will give her to you for three days." The proverb elders knew Kara’s thoughts and said, "You and Melin grew up together and put her habits back." Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the groggy Melin suddenly felt open and a city appeared in front of her, she knew that she Already out of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest camp, the proverb elders stared at the city that appeared in the magical image, his face was blue, his eyes were constantly twitching, and he’s still fighting for days and nights. After defeating, Melin’s will is too firm. This seemingly weak elf girl has a giant soul. Kara and another proverb elder are standing silently. They all witnessed the confrontation. Throughout the whole process, there was already a chill in my heart. If Melin got rid of control, then perhaps the whole proverb would be removed by her in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the proverb suddenly showed a sneer and said: "Since she wants to see Richard, let her see it, I will give Richard a big surprise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another elder elder said at this time: "It is not bad to end the war. Maybe we should not provoke Richard again..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the export, even he is a glimpse, in a blink of an eye, it turned out that he was really afraid, the forest camp, he saw the same as the gods The advent of the coming, and then with the Thunder fire, killing the gods in one fell swoop, if not later he fled fast, and certainly died like the elders who stayed on the platform, even then, he also lost an eye forever in the war, The flames thrown by Richard are extremely vicious, and the injuries it causes are extremely difficult to treat with natural forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the proverbs twitched and squeezed a word from their teeth: "We are so far away from Richard, afraid of anything."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed elder slowly nodded. According to the intruder’s standard, the location of the tribal tribe is 9000 kilometers away from the base city of Richard. Under the guardianship of the forest will, so far away. The distance is the best defense, but somehow, he still has deep uneasiness in his heart, and stressed again: "I still think that this war should be over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang elders stared at him coldly, and the chill in his eyes made the one-eyed elders immediately slumber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
