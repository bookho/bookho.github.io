			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private library, Su Helun rarely sits at the desk and looks through A heavy magic book borrowed. In the air before and after her, there are hundreds of magic books borrowing, some closed, some open, and some pages stand upright to display the above text or graphics, waiting to be selected. When the legendary wizard needs it, he will fly to her in front of him, then automatically turn to the specified number of pages, and adjust the angle to display the content on the page in the most easy-to-read way. She wrinkled her eyebrows and flipped through it, occasionally changing a few strokes on a few sheets of paper in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area is nominally a private library, but there are 70 rows of shelves, each row of seven meters high shelves are filled with a variety of magic books. Borrowing, the scale is not inferior to the Grand Duchy of the country. A beam of light is shot from the curved crystal of the dome, leaving a huge spot in the focus of the semi-circular library. Su Hailun is sitting in the spotlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the library’s half-covered door was gently pushed open, and a gnome magician with a hairy beard had walked in and saw the legendary mage. Working hard at the desk, the Magister's footsteps were immediately lighter, and then called in the lightest and softest voice: "His Royal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s busy!” Su Hailun didn’t say a good word, and he didn’t even look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome magister immediately became shocked, but thought of the importance of reporting the news, after weighing it in his heart, he finally whispered: "His Royal Highness, Soram The duke’s son has arrived and is waiting for your interview...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun slammed the table and blocked all the words behind the gnome magician. She finally raised her head this time, but her face was full of frost, and her tone was unquestionable: "I said, I am busy! Let him wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But..." The gnome magician finally swallowed the rest of the words until he gently covered the library door and said softly: "Okay, let him wait, let Soram's son wait." He just waited for three hours, and the time you specified was originally two hours ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library door suddenly opened, an almost The magic book with more than half of the gnome mage flew out, and the slamming slammed on the back of the gnome. He suddenly felt that the internal organs and the lungs had tossed hard and almost fainted. The gnome magisters have determined that Su Hailun is really very important, and it is important that even the Duke of Solam will not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full hour, the gnome magician was summoned. He immediately flew into the library, and the tired, legendary mage threw a piece of paper that was covered with a lot of paper, told him to do it, and then walked to the meeting area on his own. Because the unpleasant expression of the previously interrupted work still remains on the beautiful face of the legendary mage, the gnome magister keeps the most memorable gesture and the most remorseful expression to watch her go far, and then carefully read the contents of the paper, he Very curious about what it is so important for His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a recipe on paper that consists of one hundred and twelve kinds of ingredients and twenty-eight dishes, with a precision of one tenth of a gram. The eating time is accurate to the minute. The recipe was prepared for Richard, but the time was only covered for a month. Let the legendary Master spend more than four hours of master time to prepare, is it just a recipe for Richard for a month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this piece of paper, the gnome magister, who thought that Richard could be the most junior master builder, now feels that the "future sect of the future" seems to be somewhat successful. After all, I want the legendary mage to spend a few hours of precious time to tailor a monthly recipe, a normal builder is really not qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a magnificent small living room, the young man is standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and admiring the magnificent and magnificent ice floes. Although it is already spring, the north is still cold, and sporadic ice floes can still be seen on the sea. It is mixed with the white sails in the fleet that enters and exits the port. They may be just a larger ice floe, but it is also possible to hide a huge floating iceberg below. Although the dark blue is not a frozen port, the ship still has to be careful for half a year in the year to avoid hitting the floating iceberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look out from the floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the majestic winter mountain stretches far from the right side. The steep sea cliffs and the majestic mountains are wrapped in floats. The north side of the ice bay. The southern line is much flatter, and the terrain is only slightly ups and downs, covered with large dense coniferous forests. The southern coastline is home to deep-water ports. Although it is winter, more than half of the total of 12 berths are full of ships. It even includes a magical ocean-going ship that is nearly a hundred meters long and is more than 30 meters long. The people at the pier came and went, and the various loaded vehicles were long queues, and they did not see the off-season. A busy port means thriving, which means opportunity and means a huge amount of wealth. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant sea level line has a faintly waving flag. From the numerous sails that appear later, it can be seen that an ocean-going ship is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stared at the port, and the faint smile on his face had disappeared and turned into a thoughtful expression. In addition to him in the living room, only Minnie is there. The girl is stacking herself on a sofa and reading the magic book. But looking at her looks a little absent-minded. Waiting for four hours here, has already exceeded her limit. However, considering the close relationship between the two families, but only she is suitable to accompany the youth here, after all, the young men will not be allowed to enter here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a spectacular view!" The youth suddenly admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini coldly replied: "Randolph often said so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth turned back At the time, the face has been brought with an impeccable smile: "I am Stevenson, and he is Randolph. The biggest difference between us is that I will only say this, and he will only say that. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like a very powerful look." Minnie was a little lazy to raise her arms and stretched out, and the beautiful figure that had just grown up was unveiled. Inadvertently revealing a little style. Her eyes did not leave the magic book, but the attention was shifted by the words of Devenson. "However, Stevenson of the Duke of Soram seems to be a Dragon Warlock. Although it is very rare, it seems to have nothing to do with the builder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no slight change in the smile of the young man's mouth: "So I want to get the personal guidance of His Highness Su Hailun. The Santa Cruz Master is not without the ability to make me a builder, but at the expense of giving up the blood. I I believe that His Royal Highness has enough ability to solve this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miner slightly nodded. In fact, the Warlock is already a very rare caster who relies mainly on blood abilities. Generally speaking, the amount of magic they can learn is very limited, but the power is much higher than that of the same Master. The Dragon Warlock is one of the rarest high-end branches of the Warlock. Even the first level of the Green Dragon Blood has at least the potential to become a great Magister. It is indeed a tough choice to abandon the ability of the Dragon Warlock to become a builder. On the other hand, it also shows the special status of Stevenson. The Holy Tree Dynasty recognizes that Stevenson is the most potential person in the next generation of the Soram family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
