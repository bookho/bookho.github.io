			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical armor is even more difficult than what Richard expected More, a whole month passed and failed for a full eleven times before it finally succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical armor consists of six parts, which need to be placed all over the body, failing eleven times, so that its cost has soared to an astonishing one thousand Five million, almost wiped out the rare magic materials that Richard had left, but with this structure, Richard’s state of mind was extremely complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of the game, Richard thought that Lawrence’s physique was weaker than that of the common mage, so the design of the magical armed forces must strictly control the magnitude of the power output, otherwise If his own body is first and foremost, Richard will improve on this point and greatly increase the intensity of energy output. This is an extremely dangerous change. If it is not Richard’s physical strength, he will never dare to be so big. Change, because the changes are the core part, so the design is extraordinarily complex, almost equivalent to the design of a new structure, if not Richard Wisdom talent is extraordinarily powerful, it will take several months for the calculation part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved magical armor has become so difficult that it has approached the legendary fifth-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successfully making this magical arm means that Richard’s hand has touched the door of the Holy Builder. From now on, the fourth-order construction will It is no longer the obstacle of Richard. Every fourth-order structure is worthy of a special conference. In the fourth-order world, there is no standard construction. Every fourth-order structure will be deeply embedded in the structure. The imprint of itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a month, Richard was thinner than ten kilograms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi has prepared a few exquisite dishes for Richard, two bottles of spirits, and put a hot water in a tank, eat and wash, naturally It was a battle with Qi Qi, but this time, Qi Qi could feel that Richard had to be much more cherished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the war, when the rain was over, the sky was already white, and Richard leaned on the back of the bed, quietly watching the dawn dawn outside the window. And Qi Qi is curled up in his arms like a kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking about it." She asked a little lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can finally be sure that one day, I will be one of the most outstanding people of Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Richard said this When I was talking, I didn’t have the slightest pride, but I had a faint sorrow, so Qi Qi asked: “Isn’t that good?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s good, But not good enough," said Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should be considered good enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is silent for a long time, only to sigh Tooth, said: "To stand at the peak of the whole era, it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 prop up the body and look at Richard, ask: "Why I want to force myself like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard was silent for a long time, just when Qi Qi thought he would not answer, Richard said: "Because I I saw some future fragments, only standing at the highest point of the whole era, it is possible to avoid such a future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪不声,又伏In Richard's arms, for her, whether Su Hailun, mountains and sea or sand drifting are too heavy names, she has been glorious for a while, but she is not at the same level, her name, even out Without Fauveur, they can't enter the ears of the big men who dominate the situation on the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can grasp only a short moment in front of her, she knows that when Richard finished the magical armed forces, he will leave again, I met once, but I didn’t know what year and month. When I thought of it, she suddenly felt a little cold and couldn’t help but shrink her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong." This time, Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, I may have fallen in love with you, very bad." In the voice of Qi Qi, I brought a little cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caressed her hair and sighed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is finally full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Richard’s urging, Qi Qi jumped up, and then a gust of wind was busy, preparing for Richard’s clothes, face wash and breakfast. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, Richard finally walked outside the magic lab. When he walked out the door, he turned back and saw that Qi Qi was still watching him at the door. Richard then strode back and forced her in her arms. Then gently kissed her lips, and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big conference room, Gangde and Raymond have been waiting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, is there trouble on the border?" Richard asked as soon as he entered the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde directly waved and said: "There can be any troubles. Those Principalities are all gentle and sheep-like, and I am embarrassed to bully." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "You must be less provocative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde smiles I was embarrassed to scratch my head and said, "It’s hard to do something. Of course, I can’t help it. I just want to see how good the temper of those big fathers is.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That doesn't look like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's quite good, very good, so good, no better." A sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Raymond and asked: "How about the Iron Triangle Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond is always a calm and calm look. Slowly, Sri Lanka said: "It’s very calm. There aren’t even large-scale military movements in the country. It’s not like trying to fight with us. If they really want to fight. I couldn’t help myself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Raymond looked at Richard intentionally or unintentionally, as if he was observing Richard’s expression, in black What happened in the valley, Richard did not tell anyone, and only he and Liusha knew that sooner or later, they would fight the gods, at least the mortal war, and the war might come faster than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Raymond failed to see anything from Richard’s face again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped the table and indulged for a while, saying: "The Norland warriors in the army should now be able to regain their freedom." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, their service time has exceeded the deadline." Gangde said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "Then open the portal and let them go back to Noland. Each soldier gives an extra year to the army, right, rice. Master can also go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was shocked and said, "Let them go back, but there are several knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have been fighting for me for a long time. Since they agreed, they should do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Gangde is still very reluctant, said: "But they are really able to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case." Richard made a direct conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you have the final say, Mito's old man is still very interesting. I have some reluctance to him. I don't know if he will refuse to come back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "If Mito master is still willing to come back, of course it is good, but the master is older and wants to concentrate on studying magic. Fighting, well, I have to leave for about half a month. If the human country attacks a lot during this time, I will immediately inform me, and then I will try to drag the time and drag it back to me. The source of Zuyuan is still the same as before. Let them do it at their own discretion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confessing things that should be noted, Richard cleaned up the luggage, left Faro, and twirled through After the portal and the transmission array, Richard returned to the familiar place, the land of dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the official end of the war, the Holy Alliance resumed the practice of random transmission around the military fortress. Richard looked at his position and knew that he would not arrive until the day. It takes about seven or eight days for the city to fall. The first thing to go to the dusk is still to check the equipment and structure. Although Richard’s strength has increased a bit, but everything on the battlefield is likely to happen. Even the legendary powerhouses are likely to fall, and Richard does not feel that he is now stronger than the legendary powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessary equipment work is completed, and Richard will go all the way to the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the twilight has become the same as the old ones, and the strong men of the two main planes hunted each other in the vast world, each with a seizure, the last bloody battle, Although Daksodas was eventually repulsed, the overall loss was not much more than Noland, and the two sides were tied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
