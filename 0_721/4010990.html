			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a subordinate, Salenwell can have illusions, but Richard, who is the highest decision-maker of the entire Archimonde, can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He contacted no face in consciousness and asked: "Is something received?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No face is very happy: "A total of five top sacrifices? Is it good, when did you become so generous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only care When can you become a legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost like the top 15 offerings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The faceless answer almost made Richard crazy. He couldn't help but scream: "Did you not say that three top sacrifices are enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you summon me, I also said One is enough!" No face appears cloudy. Her meaning is obvious, Richard is too good to cheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard endured anger and asked: "How much is needed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four fifteen I really don't need more. Let me upgrade to the legend and only need five, that is, the five you sent. But to make my ability improve to the legend, you need extra sacrifices, fifteen Just the bottom line. Of course, if you can provide more sacrifices, I can also use them all. Plus five, my swords can be replaced with artifacts. Plus ten, all my equipment can be Change to artifact, you understand what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face to let Richard calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple level improvement doesn't make much sense, and the two legendary abilities without face are her strong place. And if the faceless equipment is replaced by an artifact, then her combat power will directly rise to the level of the super strong, compared with Richard. She is Richard's biggest boost, and of course, it may be the biggest trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All along, Richard is instinctively worried, so he refuses to improve his faceless strength. This mysterious guardian of heavenly elections is one of the scariest existences that can make Richard feel threatened by life. This feeling is there when she is still only a sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still thirty top prizes in the hands of Richard. This reserve is already very tense for the next war. If you use it for halfway, Richard does not even know how long the war can last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the use of the sacrifice on the faceless body, the effect is immediate. Almost every sacrifice can bring a tangible improvement. In addition, Richard does not know what other ways can achieve similar results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, can he trust no face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is very clear that he seems to be the closest to faceless, but in fact she is as uncontrollable as her mother's nest. Other followers, including the iron shield and other strongmen who later joined, have souls or magic slavery contracts as a guarantee of trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the resources on the handle are poured into the faceless body, which is gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face or worry, always keep in touch with Richard, waiting quietly for the result. She seems to have never been too strong for improving her strength. With or without it, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes of silence, as if it had been as long as centuries. Richard suddenly gritted his teeth and said, "You wait, the sacrifice will arrive soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, how many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-five!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face whistling, said: "Really generous! Then I can You are welcome to accept it. I will remind you in advance that you may not be able to beat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." After making the decision, Richard It has become easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How suddenly became so courageous?" No face asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "I don't know why I doubt you, but there will always be a kind of feeling... I can't trust it." Maybe I am afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face made a crisp and sweet laugh, said: "What are you afraid of? I am afraid of eating you? You are worried about me, or go to worry about Mex's little female cat! She is not going to give up. However, anyway, you will need a woman when you are tired in the future. Is it not right to have a door to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No face!" Richard was a little angry I sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as a big burst of laughter, and then cut off the connection with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and focused his attention on Faro’s battle. He knows that the Reaper is not far off when he is fully attacked. Maybe only half a month, maybe only one week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a war involving the entire plane, this time is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Faro map, dozens of arrows of various colors are moving toward the Dark Red Kingdom. They represent the army, some church members, and civilians who are expected to move to the final defensive bastion of the Blue Ocean Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out the window and could see that people are still coming and going on the street. People already know that the war will come, but they are not very scared. Because they live in the deep red kingdom because they are under the protection of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered the words of the famous sage of the sacred tree dynasty Louis VII. He once said: When you see the subjects, the real king will understand his vocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not care if he has the title of a king, because for the private plane, Richard’s rights and responsibilities are better than any king in the plane. Even the gods are much bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as possible, Richard still wants to do his utmost to save his subjects and save those who trust themselves and loyalty and rights to their own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has only five top prizes in his hand. He finally picked up a plan in a drawer and flipped it through pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is not very long, but it has an idea of ​​unusual genius. The plan named Hope Hongqiao was jointly conceived by Qi Qi and Palin. The core of the plan is very simple, that is, the construction of a giant plane channel connecting the two major planes of the Green Forest and the Flowing Valley in the Blue Water Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the passage is erected between the secondary planes, the amount of delivery can be very large and the cost can be reduced to the level of ten gold coins per person. This is the channel connecting Norland that can't be reached anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hope Hongqiao, Richard can send a large number of people to the other two planes, and by the way can also enrich the basic strength of the two planes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Richard did not think that the key to this solution was that the coordinates provided by the Eternal Dragon Hall were limited to Noland's connection with other secondary planes. If you want to connect between the two secondary planes, you can only calculate the coordinates yourself. This is not only a very large amount of calculation, but also quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think of the task of calculating the coordinates of the plane coordinates, which was solved by Palin. He is not the most outstanding genius of the entire Faro. With the calculation of the relative coordinates between the three sub-planets, the accomplishments in the mathematics of the plane have been chasing and even surpassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the plan, Richard also thought for two days. The main hesitation is that it takes four top-level sacrifices to build a new channel. In addition, Richard also needs time to test whether Palin calculates the correctness or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is also one of the most serious factors, that is, it takes a whole month to build Hongqiao. Under the premise of preparing to abandon Faro, there is certainly no one month to build Hope Hongqiao. But now, since Richard decided to fight the Reaper in the end, I hope that Hongqiao can be put on the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, can Richard support for a month under the reaper's offensive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because now, Palin’s data has proved to be no problem, but there is not much resources in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha patted the plan and made people call in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi has been in the Faro plane for 30 years, but under the influence of the leaves of life, she still keeps up with Richard. Look like it. Now Qi Qi has crossed the threshold of the big magician, and can make some fourth-order construction independently. Even in the three empires of Noland, she was enough to serve as the royal architect of any empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But over the years, she has always been at ease in Faro, exploring and discovering the world in a day. According to Faro's time, it often takes more than a year for her to meet with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Richard’s stay in Faro is getting longer, he often goes straight into the lab after coming, and it’s a few months. She and Richard are separated by a few walls, but the distance is as far away as the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Qi Qi, she was still beautiful, but although the years did not leave traces on her face, she precipitated wisdom in her eyes. Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart suddenly had some faint pain. He reached out and touched Qi Qi’s face and said, “I can hardly believe that you have stayed in Faro. For many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 returned with a gentle smile: "There is nothing wrong with it, isn't it? You know, I just had a little talent, but I have a little talent, but I can’t say that I’m not outstanding. If it’s not the precious potion that you’ve exchanged for a few sacrifices, I’ve never broken through the possibility of a big magician. At least for so many years, I don’t have the trust and resources that you have given me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know what to say, and looked at Qi Qi deeply and said: "When the war is over, you will be with me." After all, Faro will limit your magic growth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Qi Qi wanted to say, but looked at Richard and suddenly smiled and said: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee handed over the hope of Hongqiao’s plan to Qi Qi, saying: "This is your plan." I have arranged for people to raise resources and will arrive in Faro tomorrow. Together with Palin, I will give you another 500 Masters and build Hope Hongqiao from tomorrow!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, this takes at least a month..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have a month Time!" Richard said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪's eyelashes trembled and his eyes hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Qi Qi, Richard lifted the knife and hung it around his waist, and then walked out of the war room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
