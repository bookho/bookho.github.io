I think there will be a lot of people signing up." The old butler did not mention the amount of things, and the wisdom did not ask why it was Richard personally, not Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspected for a moment, said: "First recruit 30!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three Ten!...OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "Okay, that's all. You should do it first, and inform Niris and Aga. Mennon, I said that I am going to return to the Greenson plane at noon tomorrow, and ask them to be prepared, and then gather in the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler hastily left Richard also left the study and went to the warehouse on the bottom of the castle. The previously ordered eight million magic equipment is in place and he needs to check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you are not ordering individual equipment, but you can use it as a defense defensive giant, a total of fifteen, and equipped each giant with Thirty arrows, including special effects such as arrows, bursts, and traces, take into account the special environment of the Greenson plane, and a special set of magic arrows that can stimulate the acid mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the hallway, Richard encountered cocoa again. The girl looked very worried and saw that Richard instinctively shrank backwards, but I did not know why I had the courage to go up to the front of Richard. But she opened her mouth and immediately blushes her face, but she doesn't know how to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned, and he almost forgot the girl. In the last insurgency, he did not give Cocoa a real punishment, but it did not mean that he really forgave her. After that, Richard has opened the situation in the two planes of Faro and Greenson. Every time he returns to Noland, the time is very tight. Each trip can be calculated in minutes. How much time is allocated to Cocoa? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, I...I..." The more unknowing the cocoa, the more unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to soften his expression and said, "Don’t worry, let me talk slowly. Are you looking for me? The housekeeper can't help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco finally got the courage to say, "The housekeeper has tried his best, so I... I can only come to you. It’s about my father and my brother, it’s like this...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stood in the hallway and listened patiently. Cocoa sobbed gently, and the words were intermittent. Although it was long and succinct, the order was a bit confusing, and the description was mostly, so even Richard looked a little hard. However, Richard did not interrupt her, and it took a whole quarter of an hour to understand a general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually two things, her father’s debt and her brother’s charges. Now these two things are linked together, because most of the money sent back by cocoa is used to open up various joints and try to reduce the crime for her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not an easy task, and the aristocratic lords everywhere, including the judges in the courts, will be in such cases that have had a great impact. Maintain justice and justice as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their position is not impossible to deflect, but it is only a deflection, and at most it is a lighter sentence. And the cost of deflection is also great, at least not the cocoa income can be achieved. Although the income of cocoa is already quite high, at least several times the free Archimonde soldiers who were hired by the family and killed in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers did not object to this, because in the tradition of Archimonde, it is equally important to pass on the descendants and expand the territory on the front line, otherwise there will be no inheritance principle of Archimonde. But if you let them know that Coco has not yet been to Richard's bed, or what role Cocoa has played in the rebellion, then things will become completely different versions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Coco, Richard couldn’t give her a reply now, only let her prepare the father’s and her brother’s materials. He must first Look at the decision again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, when Richard returned to the study, a stack of thick materials was placed on his desk. Since this is the material that Richard pointed out, it is prominently placed in the center of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to carefully read through the pages of each page for half an hour, including file files, complaints, various testimony evidence, and so on. After reading all the materials, Richard thought for a full ten minutes, but found it difficult to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa’s father’s debt is no more, the brother’s case is of a bad nature, the local influence is enormous, the evidence is sufficient, and the judge’s judgment is not Where you can accuse. In the end, her brother’s verdict was twenty years of hard work. It can even be said that this is already a light sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hierarchical society, in this era of power supremacy, Richard’s current status can indeed force this to be suppressed and declare cocoa The brother’s innocence or misdemeanor. This is why Cocoa begged him. However, in the face of the final judgment of the aristocratic court, Richard filed a pen, but felt that it could not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally sighed and closed the case file and placed it in the file basket in the upper left corner, which is the area that will be discussed later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, there is a high glimpse of the documents waiting to be processed in the upper right area, and many documents reveal a corner of the paper, that It is the old butler who has seen it beforehand and put forward the disposition opinion. He just needs to see the result and sign it. But there are at least twenty or thirty major events in sight, and he must make his own decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard felt a little annoyed. He pulled the neckline of the linen shirt and loosened the button. He felt that he should meditate or draw the costume. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard discovered that he urgently needed a helper who could help him manage his territory. At least be able to replace him in dealing with these daily affairs on the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard will leave tomorrow, and the next time he returns, he is not sure. He forced himself to calm down and continue to bury himself in the file pile. An idea suddenly emerges, maybe Ellie is the most suitable object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the territory of Ellie, where it has been well managed and everything is booming. What she lacks is actually the common problem of almost all Archimonde, that is, the accumulation of money and time. If you want the territory to develop rapidly, a large amount of money investment in the early stage is indispensable, and many infrastructures cannot see immediate benefits for a period of time. However, these inputs are necessary, otherwise they will affect the long-term development. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was originally born in the same way as Gordon, but only a small piece of jazz territory, because they are not the original heirs of the family. But now, she has ruled a land of Earl, and everything is going well. In fact, in the governance and development of the territory, Gordon is even worse than her. The power of Gordon comes from his miraculous expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Richard, he can only control the floating islands. The original Gordon’s territory in the mainland of Noland is in fact semi-independent and governed by local vassals. The local lords did not pay much attention to Richard’s orders, and secretly contacted the forces of the parties. Even the spiritual symbol of the Archimonde tradition, the Black Rose Castle fell into the hands of the so-called Family Elder Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard now only sees nothing, as long as those local lords do not openly oppose him. Even if it is a blatant opposition, such as the family elders' assembly that occupies the Black Rose Castle, Richard is indifferent. It’s not yet time to settle with them, but the time is ripe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Black Rose Castle, there is indeed only a nominal symbolic status, because the real spiritual pillar of Archimonde: the family’s volcanic cemetery, has been sung Dunton moved to the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, every powerful Archimonde is eager to get recognition from the volcanic cemetery, where it gets a piece of its own position. Therefore, Richard is not in a hurry. As long as the cemetery is still in his own hands, the first thing he can't stand is his opponents. As long as the opponents can't stop moving, Richard can freely choose the battlefield and the timing of the final battle, thus defeating them in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is like this in the past. When Richard reviewed all the documents, the sky was actually white. Looking at the thick pile of documents on the table, Li sighed. In his opinion, these documents are trivial things. But in the eyes of the people involved, this is a big thing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler can arrange people's lives and do a good job of logistics, but can't decide on military equipment and related personnel, let alone diplomacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true life of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At six o'clock in the morning, the old butler had already sounded the door of the study and sent breakfast to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the materials that Coco sent, and he gave it to the old butler and said, "What should you do with this? It is really difficult to decide. If it is not possible, then remove the cocoa's partner obligation and let her leave the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler, but did not say anything. When he took the document, he only felt a little sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco, if you leave the floating island, but how to survive, what to support her family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Richard has waited in the Eternal Dragon Hall, and the Neris and Agamemnon who arrived, once again returned to the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s stay in Noland was not long, and the Greenson plane was almost three months away. In fact, when the situation in the plane is calm, the strong people are not willing to stay in the secondary plane, but prefer to return to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main plane, the power is increased faster, more opportunities are available, and for the strong, the speed of life is constant. Regardless of the velocity of the plane time, they spent eight years on the ectopic plane, which is the loss of life for eight years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Greenson's first thing, Richard is entering the magic lab, first look at how Qi Qi's progress. Qi Qi can now draw many of the most basic and most common magical arrays. From the perspective of learning speed, progress is not even slower than that of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
