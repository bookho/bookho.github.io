			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who have flesh and blood withered will die very painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the flesh and blood stripping in Undead Magic, this is a range of magic, and as chaos control increases, it can ignore most magic and Physical defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of Noland, when the demon invaded, there was once the experience of killing all the creatures in a small town with the flesh and blood withered. Since then, the flesh and blood withered has become a terror ability that people talk about, and is the same as the undead natural disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a demon lord who casts bleeding meat withered, Mex is naturally not surprised, but the problem is that this ability is cast by Richard. Seeing the ability to perform is the purest flesh and blood withered, not the magical simulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Richard get this ability and can use it, indicating that Richard’s control over chaotic rules has reached a certain level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex has seen Richard’s strong control over the rules of order, and now he sees control over the rules of chaos, so how much is there under His Highness? secret? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Mex suddenly discovered that all the flesh-and-blood warriors had been processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the magic box filled with flash metal and said with satisfaction: "The harvest is good!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Richard continued to shoot a blue fireball, banging on the pile of corpses of the flesh-and-blood warriors. The blue flame quickly burned almost all the material to annihilation, leaving only a little silver metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver metal is like a drop of water, looking for and blending with each other, and finally turned into a silver metal of the size of the fingernail, which was picked up by Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What exactly are these?" Mex asked questioningly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Yang raised the box and said: "These should be the power source used by the reaper beam weapon. It is very unstable, but it contains energy. It is very large. It may be useful to us in the future. As for these silver metals, I have not figured out what they are. But it should be the core of the reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex heard a little confused. However, Richard did not intend to explain in detail, but took her to continue to advance to the Reaper control area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Richard continued to clear the whistle of the Reaper, and soon encountered another team of reapers. This time, Richard and Mex quickly cleared the team of reapers, and Mecks added some injuries, but it was much better than the last time. Moreover, she not only killed 30 flesh-and-blood warriors, but also seized the opportunity to destroy several miniature fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This record has been quite good, but Mecks knows clearly that if there is not Richard, there are ten shes who have already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was also the source of the harvester's power, and then handed the wreck to Richard to refine the silver metal. When Mex saw the power source of the box, there was always a feeling of creeps. This thing is too unstable, and it is so powerful that Mex instinctively wants to stay away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two continued to move forward, this time the luck was not so good, and they even encountered a formation with a medium-sized warship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the battle, Mex, according to what Richard said, was desperate to maneuver and defend, and did not want to fight back. She is now able to skillfully condense the mirror walls, reflecting and weakening the reaper's high-energy beam. Whenever she feels dangerous, she will immediately condense a mirror wall. This has saved her life several times. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mex feels that his nerves are quite large, but the medium-sized warship’s high-energy beam with arm thickness is almost past her scalp, Mei Kess’s heart almost jumped out! At this moment, death is so close to her, as long as she reacts a little slower, this high-energy beam can completely evaporate her head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Meeks saw Richard appear on the medium warship! He bundled hundreds of power sources together, shot them on the hull of a medium-sized warship, and then played a blue fire on the power source, and then sneaked into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly illuminates a group of extremely dazzling fires, and the violent hurricane not only blows the reaper’s fighters around, but even hundreds of meters Outside, Mex also took a few turns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medium-sized fighter has long since disappeared, and several small fighters and nearly a hundred miniature fighters around it have also evaporated at the same time. In spite of the intense pain and strong dizziness, Mex struggled to leap, the golden epee waved, and smashed several miniature fighters that fell to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed and rushed to the sword. She plucked dozens of meters in a moment, and a sword slammed a small fighter that was about to fly back to the ground. The small fighter, like a fierce beast, screamed and changed shape. One barrel after another popped out of the body and aimed at Mex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex only felt scalp tingling, screaming, hysterically slamming the small fighter until it was cut into hundreds of small pieces. Still dare not stop, a sword is crazy to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s hand suddenly came out from the side, holding her hands, no matter how Mex struggled, Richard’s hand was steady. The points have never wavered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it's already dead and can't die anymore, it doesn't make sense to cut it again. I want these parts to be useful too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Richard’s words, Meks calmed down from extreme fear and then was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and sighed: "I originally thought that you did a good job this time, the timing was good, and actually killed a small fighter. But looking at your performance, I decided that this judgment should be withdrawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex has a red face and doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha glanced at the battlefield and shook his head and sighed: "This power source has been used too much, nothing left, and a big loss. I have to pay attention to it next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex dragged his painful body everywhere and walked toward the body of a nearby flesh-and-blood warrior, ready to be like the previous two Clean the battlefield. But when she moved, she was pulled by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can cure the wound first, clean up the battlefield by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex Nodded, but her wounds were all over the body, and if she wanted to clean it, she would not be exposed. She was still hesitant at first, and then she simply gnawed her teeth and took off her light. She cleaned up every wound in her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not avoid her, but will look at her from time to time. Soon Richard cleared all the battlefields and simply sat down opposite Mex and watched her handle the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of Richard, I just watched Mex's whole body up and down. Although Mecks always clamored for Richard to do the work, but it was also uncomfortable to be stared at by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gnawed her teeth and said: "When you want to do it, come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his head, said: "I don't want to be half-time when the reaper hits a few shots on the butt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex is shameful and angry, simply Instead of paying attention to Richard, he concentrates on the wound and puts on the armor again. He asks, "I am fine. Where are we going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He looked down and said, "Let's go inside!" Then he should go first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while walking, Richard quietly opened the corner and looked inside. Between his chest and abdomen, there is a scorch mark of the size of the bowl. This was bombarded by medium-sized fighters and was the price of Richard’s raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of wound is nothing, but the high-energy beam used by the medium-sized fighter actually contains a kind of highly toxic energy, which can continuously destroy Li. Inspect the wound and prevent the wound from healing. Even with Richard's strong body, it is impossible to immediately remove the toxicity of the wound. After so long, the wound was only a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, when Richard bombed the medium-sized fighter, the energy metal was used too much, and the power was too large. As a result, the entire medium-sized fighter was completely evaporated, and it was lost. An opportunity for a highly toxic energy source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took Mex for about half an hour and stopped. According to the changes in the surrounding reconnaissance fluctuations, Richard estimated that he could have at least half an hour of rest before encountering the next wave of reapers, so he stopped. He can continue to fight, but Mex's physical strength and vindictiveness are somewhat overdraft, and there is an urgent need for rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out half of the box of energy metals, picked them out one by one, and then tied them together for ten, and then carefully put them back into the box. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two immediately encountered another wave of reapers, the same medium-sized fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle lasted only a few minutes, and Richard destroyed all the reapers. But in order to get the parts of the medium-sized fighter, Richard has smashed its three energy cannons. This injury is also a heavy burden for Richard, and Mex was once again seriously injured, and has lost the power of re-war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
