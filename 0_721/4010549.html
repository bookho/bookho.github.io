			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melin’s thoughts, he said categorically: “The Great Elders Kill Light There is no problem with a tribal elders group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard this and smiled a little, knowing that Melin is still young and young, if she is a supporter Maybe the elders still dare not act rashly, but they still have to swear when they are chased by thousands of miles. The old foxes know that the elders are not good enough to kill a big elder of a tribal presbyterian church, but The only thing that the Yongye tribe can stand on in Linhai is that there is not much content that Mei Lin revealed to Richard, but it is enough for Richard to draw conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders who can kill a tribe can also destroy the entire tribe. The elders of the Everlasting Tribe have such power, which means ordinary The elf tribes can't even keep the tree of life. They must have several tribes united together to stay in a difficult place to survive. But this kind of drowsiness can last forever, such as the Everlasting Elder. Such a character has already destroyed the balance of the entire guardian elf tribe, which is why she can support the Yongye tribe without any help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whispering sound and Mellin’s uneasy breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The showdown is over." Richard thought, for a moment he forgot to continue to observe the energy of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​Richard just came out, the initial voice sounded again, and said nothing: "This news is really good, the strength of the elders." Still, we can also let go of our hearts. Now we can talk about the suggestion of our Aoba tribe. Our hope is that the noble forest woman can join our Aoba tribe. In this case, we will fully support the Yongye tribe, even if it ... Eventually, nighttime has had unfavorable results in the negotiations with the proverbs, and we are willing to accept any members of the Yongye tribe and ensure that they receive the same treatment as other fighters in Aoba."<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is still chewing on the meaning of this passage, and Richard has already understood it. After all, this is still a word: "blood veins", not only proverbs, blue Ye is also peeping at the blood of the Yongye tribe, the real upper elf blood, but the appetite is relatively large, and more barbaric, the green leaf is relatively good to eat, but the appetite is not small, as a young generation Excellent blood generation The Meilin, nature is the most important, is the essence of the whole stay night where the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old foxes who guard the elves are no longer foxes, but they are the characters that have stayed in the woods for the rest of their lives. Many of the guardian elves have never gone beyond the sphere of influence of the tree of life. How strong they are, in essence, is only the tree of life. The vassal, like the hounds raised by human hunters, and the number of tribes and populations that guard the elves is extremely limited. The total number of other elves that the so-called old foxes can reach is up to tens of thousands. Their horizons and insights are naturally Not strong enough to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slang and Aoba’s blood that you want to get through the various ways, it’s not as simple as they think, thinking that it’s The men and women on both sides are pulled together and the seeds are finished. The blood has a very long history in Noland. It can be traced back to tens of thousands of years. The research on blood is even more than the resources invested in the construction research. The result is almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of Akmon’s blood, there is no chance that the blood of the bloodline will be able to wake up the bloodstream more than the chances of the other children. Of course, the so-called side branch It is also impossible to leave the bloodline of the sputum too far. The necessary blood and purity are the premise of the awakening ability. But after reaching this premise, whether it can awaken and awaken what kind of ability is an unknown number, Nolande Scholars and mages have done countless studies, and the final conclusions tend to be randomly distributed. That is to say, who can awaken the blood and the ability to awaken what kind of blood is completely unpredictable, just like eternal and time The dragon dropped a dragon scale, who is who, and in the history of Noland, there is no shortage of bloody branches of the family suddenly awakened another blood, and far more than the original family's original blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although high-level wizards have already touched the rules of the plane, but the status of blood is still on the rules, no one can research The method of effectively increasing blood circulation, perhaps some super strong people do have this method, but there are certain restrictions, which can not be promoted, otherwise, Noland has long been a bloody flood, how can it be like a normal blood? The ability is well received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard knows that the way the guardian elder elders came up with the idea of ​​being simple and intuitive, brutal and rude, but it must have little effect, but Richard also knows that Even with a little bit of hope, this temptation is something the elders can't give up. What Richard is interested in now is how much the bottom line can be preserved in this matter by the guardian elves who face the face, elegance and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline finally wants to understand the key, it seems extremely angry: "You do this, and the difference between the tribal tribe, I really did not expect, The Aoba tribe is actually such a person. The Grand Elder of Royal, have you forgotten how the great elders rescued you, and you are rewarding us forever."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice sounded again, and it seemed calm and calm. He said without hesitation: "Merlin, I am very grateful to the elders for their help. Now, isn’t it trying to reward the elders? You look now, in the tribe of the guardian elves. Only our Aoba is willing to stand with Yongye. I hope that you will join the Aoba. It is also a good intention. Although Fenglu has just become a son of the forest, his strength is still not good, but his identity is also comparable to yours. The conditions proposed by the Yi language tribe are not as generous as we are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline is almost screaming: "You are also kind enough to say generosity. I will never agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disagree, what do you do for the Yongyao tribe? If you do not agree to the conditions of proverbs, then the war is going on, If the war fails, then your final result, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any result, we will have the courage to face forever." Melin screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Melin slammed the door, and Richard controlled the natural energy to settle down, quietly into the conference room, continue to eavesdrop, meeting After a quiet silence in the room, an elder said: "Do you let her go like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she returns to the night, it does not mean Sent to the proverb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should leave her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Let's stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I go, make sure to catch her back." This voice is familiar to Richard, the young Druid named Fenglu He seems extremely eager, because this incident is just related to him. The breeding is not only important, but the process is also very pleasant. Grabbing Mei Lin, that is, tearing his face, it is very likely that he will be planted immediately after he gets back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, not only Fenglu, but also two elders, these three are the main force of ambush Mei Lin, Aoba does not intend to dispatch more hunters, mainly I still hope to limit this to the extent that the Presbyterians are slightly enlarged. If I go out, it is still not very good-looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fenglu and the two elders left in a hurry, suddenly another elder said: "What if Fenglu and her descendants do not have the talent of the forest son." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a few more, anyway, she has to be born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone questioned: "If it is Maple, it can't be done."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who agree: "Also, if this is the case, a rare opportunity will be wasted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That is, such a precious blood of the night must be integrated into the bloodlines of our Aoba."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we can have a strong blood like the night, we are picking up In the next 50 years, there may be two children of the forest. With Fenglu, we can sit on the same level as the Yi language tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indefinite life The tree can also break through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the disturbances, the elders were finally moved by the last two sentences and said: "That’s it, if maple I didn’t succeed twice before the show, so all the tribes above the 18th level can try it once. In any case, we need two extra forest sons. It helps the tree of life to break through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was finally a weak opposition: "Is this not the same as the Yi tribe?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the slang is stronger than us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear here, Richard The discussion of the Presbyterian Church has lost interest. The guardian elf acts like a purebred orc, and Nolan’s elegant and noble superior elf is not a race at all, although the two are similar in appearance and At this time, Mei Lin has appeared from the crown of the tree of life. She can't even wait to go down the wooden path that circling down, jump directly from the canopy, and stride away, and several Aoba elves follow her. Constantly persuading what, Melin did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline came to Richard and barely regained a bit of calmness, biting her teeth: "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was leaving soon, and Richard did not ask why, just followed Melin, but at this moment, suddenly there was a cold drink behind him: "He can't go."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly turned around and saw a few green leaf hunters standing behind him. A hunter wearing a captain's suit was pointing at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
