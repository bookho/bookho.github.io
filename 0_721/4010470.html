			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the bottom of the valley, Richard saw the ribs at a glance, that is A very tall sergeant, the skeleton is made up of broken bones of various races, busy in front of a row of cauldrons, next to him, there is a huge experimental platform with several numbers on it. Hundreds of bottles and cans, no doubt, this is a dead soul, and not a natural undead. As far as Richard knows, all the undead should be the natural opposite of the gods, even the gods, because the undead and the God has conflicts in core interests, and both sides are competing for the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of divine punishment actually has the same status as the Great Temple. In any church, light and darkness, glory and punishment are both present, so God The land of punishment is also the core of the god of courage. It is really shocking to see undead creatures here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and other five people looked at the ribs silently, and they all felt that the land was mysterious everywhere, and it has subverted many common senses of the theological system. There are other things, the flaming fire burning under the cauldron of the ribs, the thick dark green liquid rolling in the pot, but the fuel under the pot, and the same thing cooked in the pot, is the prisoner. The prisoners who burned in the fire showed an extremely painful expression. They screamed, but they could not make any sound; they struggled, but they could never climb out of the fire. They could not see or hear, because the fire was constantly From the mouth, the nose, and even the eyelids and the ear holes, the people in the pot are equally painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl began to show the same murderousness, staring at the ribs, this is the hatred of all living instinct for the evil souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribs turned slowly, the green eyes of the soul leaping in the hollow eyes, staring at Richard, slowly said: "I... watch Come to the end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you tell me why you are here, maybe you can survive, but in another way Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead wizard Sandro should be very interested in this sorcerer, Richard did not bring the mountain Drew, originally worried that his undead can not Concealing, let a powerful undead mage enter the land of divine punishment. Normally, it is the greatest insult to a god. No matter what state Ugan is in, I am afraid to fight with Richard again, and Richard is still temporarily Don't go into the final bloody battle with Nei, for the reason, as the sand says, Richard has no way to take the gods for a while. If you know that there are evil souls like ribs in Black Valley, Richard will bring Shandru over. The most effective way to deal with undead is not the priest, but the necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't ask what I am doing." The rib asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Is there any question to ask, isn’t it suppressing the resentment, pain and fear of the soul? The general necromancer is refining. The way the essence of fear is stored, and you just change it to a more concealed method, and send the essence of fear that has been produced to the center of Black Valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The mandible of the ribs has to fall down and say, "How do you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but repeated his own Question: "Tell me why you are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames in the ribs flashed, and said hard: "I know, but... I said Not coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also." Richard nodded, and Iowa waved his hand, a little golden light hitting the ribs of the ribs, sacred flame Suddenly erupted, it burned it into a pile of fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Valley is even bigger than imagined, prisoners are dozens of times more than expected, and there are tens of thousands of people on the land where they are not seen. Living, even if everyone can live like Ptolemy for hundreds of years, the number of prisoners accumulated should not be so many. In the Black Valley, there are villages, towns, and even large fields of openness. In the mine field, a cluster of grassy plants grows in the field. The black branches are spiraled upwards, and prisoners are out of the mine from time to time. The baskets on their backs are filled with raw ore like coal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Richard saw a lot of workshops, in which the prisoners poured the black soil excavated into the mold, and then hammered it with a hammer. Then put it on the fire that is also burned by the prisoners. When the mold is opened, the black soil becomes a square black ore. In other workshops, the ore will be refined through different processes, and finally become a shiny metallic luster. The black bricks, in addition, will produce some pink crystals, look at the prisoners' attitudes, and these crystals are obviously more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black bricks will be transported to the towns in the central area of ​​Black Valley, and Richard will stop the transport of the fleet and let Iraq and Russia solve the Guardian’s undead warriors. I took a piece of black brick out of the car and looked at it. The black brick was as smooth as a mirror, which reflected the face clearly, but the strange thing was that the face was extremely distorted and painful, and suddenly I saw myself become In this way, everyone was shocked, and Richard once again showed insight, and the power in the black brick could no longer be hidden. It was also a lot of pure fear, pain and resentment. It was quite pure. Spiritual power, so everyone will see themselves twisted and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dark bricks in his hand, Richard looked at the dark black hall, which is hundreds of meters deep and majestic in the middle of the valley. He said: "I seem to have seen it somewhere, or I have heard of such a place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the fear plateau of Hell, you can see similar scenes at any time. The most common level of fear, pain and resentment is the level of hell. It’s not enough to count you,” said Nai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Nye and didn’t ask her why she was so familiar with hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the workshop or the village town, the prisoners inside were mostly numb, and they saw that Richard did not respond at all. They did not know how long they had survived. I don’t know how many times I went through the process of dying and resurrection. Richard asked Bruno and Essien one by one, but they didn’t get any answers. In the end, Iowo came up with a way to ignite a prisoner with the power of divine power. This is a more painful experience than death. The prisoner immediately screams, the other prisoners finally show fear, notice the existence of Richard, and begin to answer questions, but unfortunately they have experienced too long torture, As for the lack of reason and memory, after passing through several villages and workshops, Richard only heard a little news from Bruno, and Essien had no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a village, Richard unexpectedly saw the process of the birth of a new life, it was a woman, and the words of the face were seventy or eighty years old. The place where she gave birth was in the square of the village, and dozens of prisoners and two supervisors living in the village were on the sidelines. Richard and others also crowded into the crowd. Prisoners and even regulators did not react. Just looking at the woman in pain, a moment later, a new life was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a baby, the whole body is entangled with black gas, the small face is not twisted, and it is crying in pain, but I can't hear any sound. However, Richard’s body suddenly swayed because he 'listened' to the baby’s crying, which is an indescribable sound. It is a collection of pain and despair. Every crying is like a sharp iron chisel. Gaveling the soul of Richard, this child has a natural and powerful soul, but is born to be immersed in the deepest pain, for many devils and evil creatures with pain as food, the cry of this child is supreme Delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child has the same strong vitality, which means that he can live for a long time, but also suffers for a long time, maybe for him, the pain is already one An innate instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
