			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a battle a year ago, Sandron led the army to A large number of undead creatures cooperated with the army of the deep red Principality to break through the second great shrine that the Highland God of War had just established, but in that battle, Sandru was sneaked by a god of the Highland God of War and ate a note. The light of divine punishment, a lot of magic is burned by the light of God's punishment, and the level falls directly down two levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Sandro’s acceptance of some of Norland’s magical knowledge, causing small changes in the underlying magic rules, Clark’s dispelling magic was actually in him. The body has taken effect, otherwise he is not as simple as downgrading. It is very likely that the whole body's magic will be burned out by the light of God's punishment. It can only be converted into a lich by the life that remains in Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a necromancer, after being seriously injured, Sandru could not accept any treatment of the gods, but only rely on the accumulation of the power of death to slowly recover. More than a year has passed, and Sandro has recovered only one level of magic under countless battles, but it has never been able to cross the threshold of the big magician. He unexpectedly encountered the last bottleneck when he was promoted. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after Richard’s insights have been examined, there is still a lot of residual power in the body of the gods in the mountains, which means that the wounds of the necromancer are not good at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru did not care, calmly said: "My injury requires time, as long as time is enough, it will always be good, you do not need I care, you summon me back, it is to deal with a prisoner's soul, and when to proceed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewed again, shook his head, Link It is a 16th-level Noord Great Sorcerer who wants to impose a soul imprisonment on him in the current state of Sand, consumes a lot of money, and has a certain chance to fail or be freed, and the power of the high gods of God is not going to go away. Once you smell this kind of undead spells that are performed on the soul, you don't know if it will have consequences for the undead master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made up his mind and said, "Now no need, just like that, I want to see, who dares to stop me from killing Link, I will tomorrow. Will return to Noland, you should rest well in the first few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sandy agreed, he left the war room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day later, Richard returned to Faust. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Faust, the lineage of the Melun family, the younger generation of genius mage and the new constructor Link, because of the intention to attack the architect, Qi Qi, The news that will be executed by Richard has spread. Recently, the entire Holy Alliance has been undercurrent. There is nothing big on the surface. The little aristocrats who cannot enter the core of the Alliance will naturally feel that life is boring, and it’s hard to come out. Naturally, we must talk about special lectures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent fall of the blue moon, Richard killed a lot of little aristocrats, this hatred is still buried in the hearts of many people. It’s far from the time of forgetting, and the last time it’s been a few days, Richard has made such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family of the Melun is not ordinary, and has developed rapidly in recent years. It is said that the Duke of the Isle of Man is expected to embark on the thorny road of entering the floating world within ten years. The floating island giants are in a line. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, the Myron family sent the Link to the magic workshop of Qi Qi through the channel of recruiting magicians and apprentices by Deep Blue, and the earliest intentions In fact, it was the possibility of tempting to cooperate with Richard, and concealed an olive branch, because Link had just withdrawn from the studio of Luna, another royal master of the Holy Alliance, because both sides were silent. It is not to be said, but it has been said that there have been fierce disputes between the students of Link and Master Luno. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Myron family, half a year ago, he successfully made a second-order standard assembly, and became a true builder. Leap into the list of the core members of the younger generation, so Link’s uncle, the current Duke of Myron, was ruined by the hope of not looking at the future of the family. Everyone is looking forward to seeing what happens on the day of execution. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund has booked the stipend of the fascination in advance, and the date of execution is fixed. It is only one day before the execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Faust, when he sat in the study, the old housekeeper knocked in and said, "Master, before you come back, Mai The Duke of Lun had just sent the messenger to openly announce on the floating island square that Link must be tried and must be tried by the aristocratic joint court, not just by Archimonde himself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has already left." The old housekeeper said a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha patted the shoulder of the old butler and said, "This can't blame you. If I am not present, you can't leave the messenger, but also It’s not a chance to remedy, go and send the news of my return. If I heard it, I will come to see me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Archimonde’s eye-catching focus, all the news will be spread in the first time, and in the past two hours, the messenger of the Duke of Mainen once again came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the messenger, not the duke himself, the arrogance of the messenger is the same as above, but the ending is very different, and several guards in the dark The knight swarmed up and instantly knocked down all the guards of the messenger, then broke the messenger's legs and threw them directly into the delivery hall of Fausd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of landing, the severe pain of the broken leg caused the messenger to make another tragic sound, and the whole hall was resounded. This tragedy is like a slap in the face, loudly The fan was on the face of the Duke of Myron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the Duke of Mailen, who received the message, appeared murderously, the Duke was fully armed, his hand pressed the sword, and his body faintly burned with a vindictive flame. Behind them, there are hundreds of heavy armored warriors, each with a level of about 12, so the lineup is naturally not just for demonstrations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of heavy armored samurai are well-equipped, action-packed, murderous, and the whole team is surrounded by a touch of blood, this army is obviously not furnishings. But from the blood of the corpse, it is the troops that have the number and ranks on them. They can also win and win. From this army, you can see the way of the Meilun family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Melen was frosty, striding before the warriors, the first step into the hall, he stepped through the hall and stopped. The epee focused on the ground and exhaled a chill. The duke's gaze was like a sword. The half-white beard was hung with a layer of frost. The duke raised his hand and waved forward. Black rushes into the transmission array of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, the flash of light on the transmission array suddenly appeared a very large figure, and the pressure of the instant spread over most of the temples. Those who are less powerful in the absence of preparation almost fell on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, some people exclaimed: "The ogre lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke in the eyes of the Duke of Melan flashed, and immediately stared at the mention of the new squad. Ramisu, I have long heard that there is a terrible ogre lord among the followers of Richard, and I really saw it at the moment, only to know that it is terrible. This adjective is not too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre lord dragged ten tons, smeared with a heavy armor, step by step forward, and the pressure that spread around him Almost all have a taste of Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed sneer, round the eye, staring at the army of the Duke of Myron, said: "Those guys are coming to die, I see them. The badge is somewhat familiar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu said with a sigh of relief: "You can't do it, if you kill them before the master comes out, the master will Unhappy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed snoring, a burst of dissatisfaction in the throat, said: "You can't do it, it's not so happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the ogre lord threw a ten-ton wave of demonstrations, and the space immediately rang a strange whistle, transmitting the sanctuaries in the hall or It’s the strongman who is close to the sanctuary. His face has changed all the time. This can’t even catch the ears of ordinary people. They can clearly hear the horrible roar and know the dark warhammer in the ogre’s hand. Never touch it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merren's face is getting more and more iron, his ear power is better, not only heard the roar, but also recognized that it has reached the point of breaking Strong power level, he himself is not sure whether he can stop the ogres lord, but by holding down his hands and then making a fatal blow, it is not without the possibility of killing this ogres, just These elite warriors are bound to suffer heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But immediately after the ogre, the ray of light was constantly flashing, and it was out of the row to form a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights of the knights flocked out in a row, standing in the row behind the ogre, and actually listed as a heavy-carrying squad in the hall of the transfer. Everyone saw their eyes straight, and the Duke of Melen was even more blue-faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of costume knights that appeared appeared to catch up with the heavy armored warriors behind him. By contrast, his carefully crafted iron-blooded troops became A pure joke, there is no absolute quantitative advantage, and no matter how elite the army can't stand the construction of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
