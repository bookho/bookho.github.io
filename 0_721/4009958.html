			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Palin turned back, Richard was surprised to find that he actually had a very Young face! Yes, he must be a young man, no matter how old he is. But the hair and the sturdy body make his back look the same as the old man in his 60s. Richard once again observed Palin's back, but smelled a real aging smell from him. He glanced at the quicksand, and the sand was slightly nodded, affirming Richard's guess. Palin's body is indeed aging, but has a young soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the breath, Palin is a low-level magician, only about six or seven levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke gently closed the door for Palin, then took Richard and the sand to sit down in a lounge next to him and prepared for them personally. A pot of rich black tea, and then bitterly said: "Pelling is my third son..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly surprised, the wolf The Duke is only forty-six years old this year, so Palin will be in his early thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke paused for a long time and seemed to be struggling to choose the wording before he said: "Peilin’s mother is my most beloved woman, but she is giving birth to him. He died because of dystocia. Palin has shown an incomparable genius since childhood, not a kind of genius, but far higher than this standard, a genius I have never seen before. What you just saw is the result of his research over the years. It is said that this is the way to the ultimate mystery of the magical array, and Palin has found the key to open the door."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard’s face was calm, but his heart was shaken again. Although the magic system of the Faro plane is at least one whole order lower than Norland, the similarity of the architecture is very high, so in this direction, the ultimate mystery of the so-called magic array is the magic pattern, or It is the thing that is the same effect regardless of the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pelin just turned 20 this year." The Duke said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a curse?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I suspect that it is the curse of the god of time, Sinai, but it cannot be confirmed. At the age of fifteen, Palin publicly published some information about the position. He believes that the system of Faro's plane is not perfect, so it is not the perfect high plane that the gods claim is true. Those that we consider to be barbaric, absurd and primitive are definitely There is a system of power far higher than the existence of Faro. The gods of Faro are not the most powerful gods. In the depths of the plane, they are likely to have the power to surpass the powerful gods of the Faro gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Essien, this is a very bold guess, but it shows genius because it is close to the truth. And Palin was only fifteen years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent. From the history, we can know that one step ahead of the times will be a great man, but if it is two steps ahead, it will become a pioneer of sacrifice. Especially in the last sentence, the positioning of the gods is almost close to embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the Duke’s voice turned bitter and said: “After that shocking the king’s remarks, Palin did not know why, suddenly the aging rate increased tenfold. Now five years have passed, Palin is just twenty years old, but the body is already an old man of nearly seventy years. I know that many people are secretly saying that because Palin said those big words, they angered God was sent to God by the gods. And since then, he began to fear the wind and the natural wind. Only in the depths of this mountain, with the power of magic and ancestors to isolate the power, can he not be aging The curse is tortured. Now, Palin's only wish is to complete the foundation of magical mathematics before the death of the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the weight?" Richard asked very vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Palin... I owe him too much to his mother and owe him too much."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to quicksand and asked: "Is there a way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand nodded and said: "Peiling’s level of aging curse is very high. High, most of which is a curse that directly descends from the gods. In fact, this curse does not affect the flow of time, but catalyzes the function of the body to achieve the effect of aging. All gods may drop the curse of aging as a punishment, of course, The curse of the god of time, Sinai, is definitely stronger. At present, my level of magic is not high enough to directly lift the curse of aging on Palin, but as long as the altar is built and successfully sacrificed to the dragon of eternal and time, get the rapids of life. The grace of God can cover the curse of aging. However, Palin has cursed for five years, and the decay of bodily functions requires other gods to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Subsequently, the quicksand explained the effect of the life torrent. In conclusion, the conclusion is: "So, altars and sacrifices are the key to saving Palin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Duke light up for the first time, these five years, He didn't do nothing. On the contrary, he had searched all the methods, including reading the ancient records of the library, sending the messengers to distant countries to find herbs that exist only in the legend, in addition to not asking for grace. Warcraft, magic items, and anything else that can prolong life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that he feels that hope is within reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully asked about the grades of the required sacrifices, and when he learned that the sacrifices required by the torrent of life were at least the power of the Great Devil or the Big Devil At the level, the face was only slightly embarrassed, and then replaced by determination and fortitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Devil or the Big Devil have the power to transcend the ordinary sanctuary of Noland, and the mighty might even have 20 powers. For the Duke of the Wolf, it is a powerful enemy that is difficult to provoke, but he did not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the altar ready to be built?" asked the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my territory, it is easier to keep secrets." Richard has long considered this issue and answered quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! I will try my best to support you. What do you need, supplies, gold coins or the army?" asked the Duke. This can already be said to be an expression of alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks about what is most needed in the moment. He won't open the lion, because now the Duke can only say that a preliminary agreement has been reached. The relationship between the two sides is still very fragile, and it is fragile to the point where a misunderstanding will break down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard said: "Duke of the Duke, thank you for your kindness. I really need help now, mainly in three aspects. First, I need A stable trading channel that can trade food, weapons, slaves, and magical materials. Second, I need a list that should include two parts, one for your real friends and enemies, and the other for those I need to pay attention to. The strong, including the legendary strong, the more detailed the data, the better. Finally, it may be the most important request, that is, I need a lot of magic materials to build the altar. All the materials I get from you, I will pay the corresponding Price, the only hope is to be able to guarantee supply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
