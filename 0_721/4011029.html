			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star Sage has indulged and said: "You have completed the top commission, and by convention it is possible to make some requests to Archimonde, but This request...somewhat difficult, because it must be confirmed by His Royal Highness. Well? You stand up and let me see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The three heavenly sanctuaries under the natural disasters were all angry, but the natural disasters did not disagree, but they went to the front of the sages and turned around in a big way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xing Xian indicated that the natural disaster sat down and said: "You have a lot of dark wounds on your body, and there are many new injuries. Is it because of this mission?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were several minor problems on the road." The natural disaster was an understatement. But everyone knows that it is possible to let the legendary killers like the natural disasters be injured, and how much trouble can be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xing Xian nodded and said: "You really have sincerity. This way, His Royal Highness gave me certain authority, you can make some decisions. You can join first. Archimonde, then complete the mission, or participate in the points battlefield. When your points reach two thousand, you can become a follower of His Highness. Under such conditions, are you willing to accept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile in the eyes of the natural disaster, and immediately stood up and said, "We are willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition is not even a test On the other hand, it is only in disguise that they should make some contributions to Archimonde, which will also allow the former followers to be psychologically balanced. Two thousand points is a difficult problem for the ordinary sanctuary. It is not difficult for the natural disaster victims, who are walking around the edge of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul and the blood axe also showed a relieved look. It seems that the news of the natural disaster is accurate, and Archimonde does open up the recruitment of followers, but this recruitment must be quite strict. Just because they have completed this top commission, there will be such a loose joining condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of strong people are stalking, and then walk into the transmission array leading to the Black Rose Castle. Their breath suddenly alerted the natural disasters in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they going to do?" asked the Scourge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness has just released a special point mission, and the strong man in the battlefield battles against the Holy Tree Dynasty. This task gives a lot of points, but it is not forced to participate. After all, this is a battle with one of the three empires. Many people are not willing to offend an empire. Those who are willing to join the war are either the Holy Alliance and the Millennium Empire, or the free power without the affiliation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The light in the eyes of the natural disaster flashed and said, "Okay! I am participating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xing Xian was slightly surprised: "But your injuries have not been raised." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster said faintly: "We are not worth the lives of these people, as long as they can move, they can fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster went to the gate, and her three priests stood up next time, raised their fists and touched her, and said, "For the sake of natural disasters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ritual before the natural disaster every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were nine people who had debuted together in the past, and now there are only four of them, including the natural disasters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster paused and said, "No, now we are in order to score. Wait for two thousand points, just to see His Highness."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six killers left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xing Xian sighed and shook his head. He not only recognized the natural disaster, but also recognized the ghoul and the blood axe. These people have strong strength on the one hand, and great trouble on the other. They have killed too many people in the past years, knowing too many secrets, and countless people want them to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants often use them to do some unspeakable activities, and often find ways to kill people after the event. The loved ones of those victims will also pour hatred on them, sometimes at the expense of a lifetime of hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants will use them, but even a strong man like a natural disaster is just a dog that can be driven by the roots in the eyes of the giants. Dogs are also easy to use and not easy to use. No matter which one, dogs are dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few giants are willing to take in killers because it means taking over their past hatred. In the end, the killers can only hold their own groups, and set up a killer organization like the Scourge and the Dark Blade, relying on the power of the group to survive in this cruel world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark world also has its own rules. Unless a killer loses his combat power, he will never be able to leave the organization. Otherwise, it will be pursued by all organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time, the old rules were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund is the first to export, not limited to the background when recruiting strong. Although the war with the Reaper has reached its most critical juncture, the heavy casualties of the strong players on the previous point of the battlefield have also discouraged the ordinary strong. But these dangers are nothing to the killer. When did they go out of the task, are they not ready to return? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this time Archimonde’s decision caused a sensation in the dark world, and there were important members in the top killer organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the troubles of natural disasters and others, Xing Xian knows that since Richard made the decision, he did not take this trouble into his eyes. And Archimonde, who has played positively with all three empires, does have the courage to face everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancient rules of the dark world, it is nothing less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund has always lacked the Master, but never lacked the top killers and fighters. Even followers such as Gangde and Oral, who are not known for fighting, are experts in dealing with assassins. They are often confronted with perverted killers like splashes and ochre. Although it was miserable every time, it was the skill that was slowly honed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the portal of the Black Rose Castle, the vibrant killing and shouting came to him, the holy tree closest to him. The dynasty warriors are even less than two hundred meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, on the hillside and even the plains far away, there are black-pressed sacred warriors everywhere. Before the tide of white and red, the line of defense of the Archimonde warriors was as thin as a piece of paper, as if it was broken at a glance, but no matter how the opponent attacked, the line of defense was stubbornly standing there and never collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard first appeared, he took over the command of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice rushed in immediately, the female army god on the battlefield was covered with blood and sludge at the moment, and the voice was completely dumb. She is full of dark red blood everywhere, and she can't tell whether she is an enemy or an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard greeted him and gave Ali a heavy hug. He whispered, "You have worked hard. Now it is all right to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie The nose was a bit sour, but forcibly resisted the tears that should not appear, but just slammed on Richard's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at the dynasty army at the foot of the mountain like a sea, revealing a meaningful smile, saying: "This time, our enemies should "Is it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be! I saw the flag of the seven dukes among them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" said Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dragons and tyrannosaurus knights constantly stepped out from the portal, their huge size and fierce atmosphere let Allie A glimpse of red short hair roots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the portal on the other side of the castle, the strong players from the point battlefield are squirting out, they are immediately served as the elite of the commander The knight leads to the scheduled battle zone. It was only when the disaster and other people came out, the knights and knights stayed on the spot, this is not the person on the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the battlefield, Richard does not remember the presence of these in the points battlefield. They are obviously very powerful, but the breath is hard to distinguish, obviously it is a killer's first-class figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disaster went to a Knight in front of the squadron and said, "My name is natural disaster. These are my companions. We are the name of my Highness. Come. His Royal Highness has agreed to join Archimonde, but whether you can become a follower still needs to see the future contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sinking and letting a Knight of the Front take them over. These are the top killers, and it’s not what they are good at. So Richard is ready to let them follow the Frost Dragon Knight. With these behemoths as cover, the killers can make the most of their strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the troops brought by Richard were arranged. He looked at dozens of floating sacred dynasty tyrants in the distance, sneered and slowly lifted off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s previous tactics are to hide the strong, if the strong of the sacred dynasty dares to break into the Archimonde line, it will instantly On the set fire of the knight, then the strongman on the side of the Archimonde made another raid. In this way, Ellie effectively leveled the gap between the two sides in the number of strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
