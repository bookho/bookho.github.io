			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of black is like a piece of lead in the heart, so that he only wants to control as soon as possible Strong power, so return to Noland as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power in the hands of Richard is rapidly expanding, but the farther he goes on the road of strength, the more he really feels Su Hailun and the mountains and the sea. powerful. In the past, he only knew ignorantly that Su Helun was very powerful, but to what extent he was so powerful, he knew nothing about it. Just as a mortal looks up at the starry sky, he only knows its vastness, not knowing his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard finally feels that he knows a little about it, but it makes him see more. He thought that he and Su Helun were only separated by a mountain. Now But it is necessary to add a vast ocean. As for the mountains and the sea, the girl is taking another road of strength and still makes him unable to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hotel, Richard’s first thing was to walk into the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been temporarily transformed into a torture chamber, a hall connected to a dozen narrow cells, a large number of torture devices in the torture hall, mostly It was temporarily borrowed from the Jinhui Battle Flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the cells held in the cell were dwarves, and there were several heads of the Red Cossack Caravan. Several indecent prisoners in the torture hall were naked and were dragging a dying dwarf from the torture device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sissor, who stood on one side, came over and opened the holy book in his hand, chanting the spell with a soft, slightly trembling voice. A glimmer of light flashed on the dwarf, and the dwarf who was kneeling on the edge of death was pulled back again. This young adult is pale and obviously unacceptable to this bloody and cruel scene, but it does not affect the casting of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shadow on the face of Baron Fang Dan, and the talent in the magic is gradually appearing. In a short time, he has become a third-level priest and can cast A treatment is gone. In any of the temples of Faro, the third level is the standard of the official pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the elf poet Oral in charge of the torture. His handsome and feminine face is somewhat distorted by anger, and the eyes are sprayed with cruel and cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hang him up, pour a few buckets of ice water to keep him awake! See if he can remember the route back to the Thunder's anvil!" Ola Some of them screamed in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two prisoners hanged the dwarf and poured a few buckets of ice water. The dwarf in the coma shouted and woke up, and all the wounds on his body all hurt together, so he couldn't help himself. However, there was still a voice cursing in the shackles. It seems that the repeated torture did not make him yield. And this dwarf can hardly find a good piece of flesh. Xisuo used only the treatment of minor injuries. The effect was to keep his life, but he could not make the wound on his body heal instantly. That is what the level of sand can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went into the torture chamber, glanced at it, immediately frowned and asked Oral: "Why, haven’t they yet opened?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These guys, really Connaught... really a dwarf." Oral said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet is gloomy and sultry, and learned the many dark worlds from Richard, as well as the pastor’s cooperation. I didn’t expect to use it for a day or night. Let the dwarves tell the most important information, the location of the Thunder's anvil tribe. Be aware that as long as a pastor is present, the cruelty of torture will rise linearly, and the multiple of the rise will depend on the rank and the magic of the priest. If there is a big god officer present, it is a missed hand that can not catch up with the prisoner and can be rescued in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's double eyebrows wrinkled even more tightly, asking: "Do they still insist on those claims?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, master." Oral smiled, Wiping the sweat on his forehead, said: "They said that they signed a contract with the red Cossack under the testimony of God. They will support them in the next 30 years and will not renege on their vows. These dwarves have a bad temper and are hard bones. I can only get a little bit of grinding. I need more time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the dwarf and asked: "Do you have a strong relationship? And they said clearly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard said this sentence, the tone has been faintly brought a chilly cold, so that Oral involuntarily Trembling a bit. The elf poet said: "I have already warned them that if we cooperate with the red Cossacks, it is our enemy, and we will not be soft to any enemy. Only cooperation with us is the only way to live. But..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf of the Thunder's Anvil will never turn away from God's vows!!" A loud scream came from the side and interrupted Oral's words. It was a thick and strong dwarf gunner, and his beard was as thick as a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the dwarf’s cage and squatted down and said faintly: “I don’t need you to renounce the vows before God, I want It’s just the formula of your gunpowder. As long as I get the recipe, I will let you go. If you are willing to support the red Cossack, that’s your business. Just remind you that the red Cossack is my eternal Object, if you let me see the dwarf of the Thunder's anvil on the battlefield, kill all innocent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to get the recipe of Thor's fire, dream of you The dwarf gunman laughed, and then screamed at him in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's face was cold, the airflow in front of him, the instant magic protection swayed the airflow, and the thick mouth was sent directly back to the dwarf Face. He now has no patience and the consumption of these dwarfs. Instead, he stands up and walks to the leader of the red Cossacks caravan. He faintly asks: "Who, do you want to tell me what I want to know?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are silent, only a middle-aged man snorted and said: "You dare to grab the red Cossack's goods and kill the red Cossacks." People, just wait for death! When our army arrives, you'd better pray that you can die on the spot. Otherwise, there will be strong men of all races line up your ass! Your women will also end. It’s not so good, they have to be done by at least fifty things every day...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, waved, a silence to middle age The words behind the person blocked it. He frowned and said: "Why are we all stinking and hard guys? Isn't Red Cossack not afraid of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li The sound of the inspection was very dull, but Oral also involuntarily chilled. He didn't know how to answer this question, but he didn't answer and didn't. If the room was silent, the atmosphere would be suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, maybe it’s just that our luck is not so good this time..." Oral said carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Some comments on the shelves<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 1st, "Sin City" is on the shelves It is the unified activity planning of the website, and it is actually a change of the 17K business direction. The effect of this change is yet to be proved afterwards. However, I have spent the past few years on this platform, and I hope that the website can develop better. With a big tree, you can enjoy the cool. Based on this, I still have to do my best to support this change in 17K. Previously, Nanfeng had promised that this book has been free, but now I can't complete the promise, and I will say sorry to everyone on her behalf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
