			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a moment that Richard has seen a lot of things, and Irene rushed out and stood in front of Richard. There was a kind of look that seemed to be thrown into his arms, but he endured it. She reached out and pulled Richard into the room, then glanced out, and then closed the door and locked it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene leaned back against the door, staring at Richard, her chest was undulating, her face was flushed and she was very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was looking at the room. This is a small house, consisting of two inside and one small bathroom, fully functional, but very small, standing on the door, you can see all the corners clearly, and only the bedroom There is a window leading to the patio, and the other spaces are all four walls. There is also a magic light in the room, but it is not lit, but replaced by a candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small room is full of the smoke of the candle, but it is also difficult to hide the smell of the girl's body. The room is very small, there is only one single bed and one cupboard in the bedroom, and the bathroom can only stand for a bath. The outer hall is no bigger than the bedroom. There are a lot of things in the room, but the code is very neat, and the space is used skillfully, there is not much crowded feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard observed the room, Irene suddenly saw that there was overflowing blood between Richard’s fingers, and his hands were a bit sticky. Greasy. She reached out and looked in front of her, and by swaying the light of the candle, she saw that the palm of her hand was full of blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that I was pulling Richard’s hand and pulling him into the room, Irene couldn’t help but scream: “Richard! Are you hurt?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha waved at random, and some said carelessly: "It’s a little hurt, it’s okay." It’s a little hurt for him, it’s not worth mentioning. Especially after seeing the whole process of Naja's treatment of blood parrots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene has seen the injury in his palm. The rough surface of the iron strip has almost scratched all the skin of the finger to the palm, and Richard has several times. Pressing it yourself makes the wound look awkward, as if the entire palm is cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but raise her voice and cried: "How can you get hurt! They promised that I wouldn’t really hurt you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words were exported, Irene immediately covered her mouth and her face was pale. And Richard looked up, not many unexpected expressions, sharp eyes like I swept over Irene's face, and all her reactions were in the eye. Then his eyes turned to serenity and calmly said: "You really participated. Then tell me who they are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more calm Richard is The more Irene feels the cold. She subconsciously grabbed her collar and lowered her head deeply, saying in a voice that was almost impossible to hear: "It’s Minnie. She came to me, let... let me lead you here, she said some Personal things want to tell you. I... I can't refuse, so I have to promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Minnie promised me, never hurts Yours! And she said, you are your favorite student, how can she hurt you?" Irene's voice is getting higher and higher, it is more like trying to convince herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard was very calm and asked: "Mini? How much did she give you, and what reason can't you refuse?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene gradually calmed down here, bitterly smiled and said: "A total of five hundred gold coins, and she promised not to find my father's trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Five hundred gold coins? Originally, I only valued this. But with your father, the weight is almost enough." Richard laughed and laughed, then looked at Irene, the smile on his face gradually disappeared, asked: " Your first time is also sold, can you tell me how much I sold?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene’s face turned pale and the head was deeper. But after a while still said: "Two thousand gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four bottles of ordinary magic recovery agents." Richard commented on this number in a near-cruel way. And continue to ask: "Who is the other party? Why do you rather earn his money, and are not willing to use mine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very old question, And it has been mentioned. This time, Irene didn't choose to escape. She seemed to be out, and quickly replied: "It is Stevenson, also a student of His Royal Highness. I was in desperate need of money at that time, and he just made a request at this time. I ... I am just an ordinary person living in the fringe area, barely touched the side of the nobility. With his power and identity, I have no way to refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sidvinson..." Richard read the name several times, and the important one was buckled. All the things were like jigsaw puzzles, and the pieces were spliced ​​together, and the outline of the conspiracy became clear. However, there are still some knots in his heart that can't be opened, and the violent blood in the deepest part of the body is beginning to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What price are you now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard made Irene involuntarily tremble At first, she couldn’t bear the cold and hugged herself. He whispered: "Besides Stevenson, there are no other people. He will come to me occasionally, giving me two hundred or three hundred gold coins each time. When I...when I need money, I will go to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What price are you now?" Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene finally bit his teeth and said, "I owe you one thousand six hundred gold coins, if it is you, one hundred times!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard slowly reached out and grabbed the front of her bra, and the tyranny that was swaying in her chest became more and more serious, almost irrepressible. He suddenly wanted to see the blood, and the fact that Eileen deliberately avoided was repeated in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the five hundred gold coins, you sold me, almost let me die?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard squeezed out these words from his teeth, and his eyes didn't know when it was covered with bloodshot eyes. His hands jerked, and Eileen’s nightgown had been torn in half! Richard grabbed Irene, went into the bedroom, threw her on the bed, and slammed it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy wheezing, the beast-like squatting and the squatting of the girl from the depths of the throat are intertwined, filling every corner of the room. Irene is like a boat in the raging wind, and can't help but rise and fall. Her hands clenched on Richard's back muscles, and when it was the most unbearable, a slamming sound left ten deep blood marks on Richard's back! The severe pain made Richard scream, but the pain was like the dry wood that was thrown into the fire. It only made the flames in the body burn more fierce, so Irene’s voice also increased. degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm does not know how long it lasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people only knew that when they finally separated, they didn't have much effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is very narrow and must be snuggled to accommodate the next two people. Irene and Richard lay side by side, staring at the gray ceiling. I don't know how to open the head, the girl begins to talk about herself, and Richard is listening silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many protagonists of the story, Irene was born into a family of little nobles. The father is a hereditary jazz, with a small territory consisting of two villages, on the border of the sacred dynasty, next to the Marquis of Nicholas, not too far from the kingdom of Solam. If the affiliation is strictly sorted out, Irene's father belongs to the vassal of the Marquis of Nicholas, so for her, Minnie and Soram are all people who can't refuse at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene’s father has a special liking for art and is passionate about the communication of the upper class, but is not good at operating the territory. So over time, the debt has gradually become an astronomical figure that cannot be repaid. Irene was sent to dark blue to learn magic since she was ten years old. She does have a good magical talent, but that is based on the standards of her father's territory. In the dark blue, she is nothing at all. Soon, Irene used up her savings and received less and less funding from her home. She could only rely on herself to maintain her life and study in the dark blue. Without money, her progress in the field of magic has slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old jazz can't afford a magician who grew up in the dark blue, and he doesn't want to train a big magician. The real idea of ​​the Jazz is actually a dark blue halo, Irene can sell a good price. In the common language between the nobles, Irene can marry a Viscount as a wife, or give a count or even a small marquis as a mistress. Without a deep blue experience, Irene can only be a baroness, and the condition of the baron depends on Irene's dowry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Irene is desperately making money, only to be able to stay in dark blue. Once she returns to the family, she will be used as a bargaining chip for political marriage. On the other hand, another reason why the old jazz did not force her to go back immediately was that his debt had reached the critical point of the crisis and he was likely to be taken away at any time. The reason why creditors did not apply to the Circuit Court for mandatory jazz bankruptcy was because they would seriously consider the future of a teenage magician who could stay in the dark blue. They are not willing to offend a future magister in order to collect debts. As long as Irene stays on a dark blue day, the creditors will not be too much. Of course, if she is willing to go back, the debt problem will be solved. There is already a widowed viscount who is old enough to have a wealthy asset and said that he is willing to pay the debt for the jazz, provided that Irene agrees to marry him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini has apparently investigated Irene’s life and knows her father’s situation at the moment. If Irene refuses to cooperate, then Minnie will immediately take away the jazz territory through the power of her family. The Jazz has long been in a state of insolvency, and now the income in the Territory has been able to maintain a minimum of decent life after paying interest on the debt. If it is taken away, it means that it has been deprived of the title of nobility, either for the jazz or for Irene, which means that the class has taken a big step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Minnie also hinted at Irene, she wants to contact Richard privately, part of it is the reason between men and women, and promised never to hurt Richard . What about the majesty of His Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I have no way to refuse." The girl finally said. She reached out and took Richard's hand and stroked the new wound on his palm. He asked, "They didn't do anything too much for you? Are you hurt badly?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the trouble has been solved." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
