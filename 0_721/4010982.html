			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard’s heart is still heavy and inexplicably heavy. He sent people to the three goddess to stay in the blue water oasis city avatar communication, and then saw them in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incarnation of the three goddesses is very similar to their own bodies, but the temperament is slightly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddess gods are tall and majestic, full of unspeakable sorrow. The incarnation of human beings is not the case, but it is more soft and charming, making people feel more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war of God stops immediately!" said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Our warrior has just broken into the Kingdom of Kamia, and everything in it will soon become ours. Why are you here? It’s not too cheap for him to stop the war. Would you like to wait another three months, as long as March is enough! The gods of several other guys are also very vulnerable now, and we can break one every two or three years. The Kingdom of God." The incarnation of the forest goddess. Kamia is a wild god of weak power, swallowing up his godhead and priesthood, and will have a great gain on the forest goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring water and the goddess of hunting clearly hold the same view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned and said: "If you have broken the Kingdom of God, you will continue to attack, but the three months are too long. I will give you at least one week. As soon as I win this godland, I will put in a lot of swallowing insects. Finally, you will inform the gods of the south and the gods of the whole Faro and tell them that in the future, the gods should unite and fight against foreign enemies! The power of foreign enemies is beyond imagination. If the gods want to live longer, then join together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddesses are all incarnations Shocked, ask: "You mean ...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this time the enemy is so strong that I have no way to deal with it. So, I will... give up Faro." Richard said heavily. This decision is also the advice of many followers, and even some of the strongest of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard made the three goddesses truly horrified, and even the voice began to tremble. If even Richard has to give up Faro, it means that they are not only indifferent, but also in danger of falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to give up Faro? Are they really so powerful?" Under the goddess of hunting, the question is simply nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard still nodded. He indulged and finally made up his mind and said, "But you are the first god to cooperate with me. So I can Give you an opportunity to transfer you to another plane. But the cost of doing so will be heavy. You must give up the priesthood and the godhead in Faro, become an ordinary legendary powerhouse, and lose eternal life. Qualification. In another plane, if you are willing, you can try to reignite the fire, of course it will be very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddesses face each other, this choice is Very difficult and very easy. The key is how terrible the enemies in Richard’s mouth are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is true, as Richard said, of course, immediately give up the throne and follow Richard to other planes. Even if you lose your position and eternal life, it is better than dying. Moreover, the soul tortured by God's fallen is a hundred times more horrible than the death of a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of spring water asks: "His Royal Highness, you think, if all the Lord God of Faro, and all the nations and the strong are united, and the enemy In the case of World War I, how many chances will you win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zero. I want you to call on the gods to fight against the enemy, just to fight for a little more time, so that I can withdraw more of my men." Richard's answer immediately ruined the fantasy of the three goddesses. However, they still hold the last hope, and hope that they can go and see the enemy that Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the goddess of hunting asked: "His Royal Highness, where are the enemies you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He pointed to the coastline in the northeast and said, “It’s in this area.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of hunting said: “Good! We hope to see it for yourself. Their strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned, but nodded and said, "Yes! But you only have half a month at most. Take you It takes at least seven days to convert into a mortal ritual. You can leave Faro only by cutting off the natural connection of the rules of the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will be careful. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and waved to let the three goddesses' avatars retreat. Then stand in front of the window and overlook the blue water oasis city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city built on the lake has developed into the most prosperous and largest city in the whole of Faro after decades of development. The city has expanded far and has wrapped half of the lake in the city. There are now more than a million kingdom citizens living in the area, as well as hundreds of thousands of floating population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that there were bustling pedestrians on the streets, most of them dressed in gorgeous, smiling and proud, especially when facing people from other countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deep Red Kingdom defeated the Iron Triangle Empire after a battle, and it became the first strong country of Faro. All people who have acquired citizenship in the kingdom have a natural status. Moreover, Crimson is located between the human kingdom, the ancestral highland and the pale plateau, and is also a distribution center for the trading materials of the plane. The degree of enrichment far exceeds the limit that can be reached under normal conditions of the Faroese human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the concept of Richard’s governance plane is not advocating plunder, but is willing to allocate more wealth to the aborigines of the plane. Driven by the interests, the countries and ethnic groups in this position will naturally develop more resources for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Richard, the huge price difference between the planes is the source of wealth, and the high point of the transaction price inside the plane is completely negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this concept, after decades of development, citizens of the Crimson Kingdom have lived an unprecedentedly rich life. By now, the Crimson Kingdom has become a paradise for adventurers across the continent. The citizenship of a kingdom has long been speculated in the black market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people who are now watched by Richard, still do not know the fate of their coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane channel can't carry so many people, most of them will be abandoned, and after a long time, the city will become hell. Exquisite buildings will collapse in the fire, and people will die in beams and metal storms. And they will not get peace after they die, flesh and blood will be cut, become a raw material that does not know what it is, as for the soul, even Richard does not know where to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the entire plane will be silent and will be dragged to the matte night area. From then on, in the history of order, there will be no such name as Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their destiny. And now they are still blissfully happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and contacted the patriarch in consciousness and asked about the location of the messenger. The coordinate information transmitted by the mother's nest indicates that the three messengers are already close to the Blue Water Oasis City. The other two are flying north, and it is expected that there will be a few more hours to reach the location of Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a little peace of mind and then asks: "Winter, how can you leave Faro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, my avatar is already in Green Forest. Even if the body here is destroyed, I am equivalent to being born again in Greenson. During this time, I am not going to try to leave Faro because I am The army you create can help you fight against the reaper. Without me, you can't take away 500,000 people, and even 100,000 people can't get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Silence is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest said that it is the fact that there is a mother nest, and the turbulent place is a super strong fortress. However, if the mother's nest leaves, it will become a replenishment material replenishment warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the existence of the mother's nest, which can have countless avatars, ontological destruction is not the end of the day and the end. As long as there are enough resources and time in the future, they will become as powerful as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and asked the messenger to stand by in Oasis. He is going to return to Noland, re-adjust the family's combat power, and see if he can win some allies. When he returned from Noland, Richard was ready to go in person with the Reaper to see where they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is now exceptionally precious, and Richard did not stop, went directly to Noland, and immediately contacted St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Noland was already in the middle of the night, and the saints wrapped in a nightgown appeared in front of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marin squinted and yawned and said, "Dear Richard, you will really find time! I just slept, you pick this time I cried. At this time, shouldn't you stay in your plane and try to fight the terrible reapers? Isn't the reaper so powerful that you still have time and mood to come and chat with me? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said directly: "I really don't have time, so I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin's expression is serious, saying: "You have seen the harvest "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen how they fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin said: "I have checked some information about the reapers. They are almost unstoppable, and any resistance is finally proved to be in vain. It is the famous giants in the history of Noland who failed to save their plane from the reaper. The most realistic way is to withdraw the army as quickly as possible and then blow up the time lighthouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused to see Richard’s expression and said "The most horrible thing about the reapers is that they will use the resources in the plane to constantly build the army. Before the plane is destroyed, they will only get more and more. So fighting them is actually meaningless, it will only consume you in vain. The army is nothing more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said helplessly: "It has been Ten people have said this to me. When did you become so embarrassed?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s booth said: “Because I saw you, obviously This decision makes you very unhappy. No one will be happy, but it is necessary to do it. Because you are the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiled: "Of course I know! Don't worry, I won't be so ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, now you can tell me what you need help." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and said, "Two things, one is that during the time I fight the Reaper, you can restrain the sacred dynasty." The lords do not attack my territory. Another thing is that I want to borrow a group of saints from your hands. It is best to include the three Midranden. I need them to help me stabilize the order of the battlefield." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin was silent for a while, and for the first time, Richard saw a serious and serious expression on the face of the Son.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin slowly said: "Lee, since you asked me such a request, you still trust me. Then I have to tell you a message. The three Midranden are already on the road, and in about another day, they will arrive at the Earl of Burton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
