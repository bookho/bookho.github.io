			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Martin shines with a holy light, looking at the enemy thousands of times without fear. Suddenly his face turned and looked back, but he found that there was no Heavenly Warrior behind him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fourteen fighters are now desperately vibrating their wings and flying away at full speed. They actually escaped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin showed helpless smile, but when he turned around, he became calm again and calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly army is rolling in, and the little pumice is drowned in an instant! Countless Heavenly Warriors bypassed the pumice from the side and continued to pursue. A small number of soldiers rushed to the pumice stone, ready to wipe out this unsightly guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's long sword flicked like a lightning bolt into the chest of the first celestial warrior. The celestial warrior who was fatally injured screamed and fell softly. Suddenly a raging fire from his body, and the torso quickly melted, eventually turning into a beam of light in the fire, flying into the sky, and then disappearing at the end of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin long sword keeps flying and kills several Heavenly Warriors one by one. But more Heavenly Warriors rushed to the pumice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little pumice stone has become Martin’s own battlefield, and the flames of the group have erupted, and the pumice is completely submerged from time to time. After a while, the light was slightly weakened, revealing the two sides of the battle, until the next wave of flames picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's face is eternal, and he keeps whispering, and the long sword in his hand sends the enemy to the source of light. Finally, a thin light in the void, injected into Martin's body, suddenly let his spirits revive, the momentum that has gradually declined is rising again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the source of light to the faith of Martin's devout faith, can make up for his loss of power and life, but to a limited extent. This is not Martin's patent. In the army of opponents, there will always be a bunch of light falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it didn't take long before another beam fell on Martin's body. This even made the Heavenly Warriors who besieged him stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a short interval, Martin’s prayer is so effective, how firm and religious is his faith? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this fact did not let the Heavenly Warriors slow down the offensive, but completely angered them. In the eyes of the Heavenly Warriors who have differences in their beliefs, the more devout Martin is, the more damn it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more Heavenly Warriors gather around this little pumice, and Martin is like a raft in the hurricane lang, constantly The crest is in the bottom of the valley, but it is not willing to overturn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the darkness, Richard stood in front of the old man, frowning, and asked for a long time: "You waited for me for three thousand years?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The old man nodded and seemed to know what Richard was thinking, and added: "My concept of time is very precise."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sentence, Richard is not convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to the dark area, Richard has not seen anyone with a true sense of time. This means that extraordinary talents and strengths, perhaps plus luck, even superpowers, may not be able to establish precise time-lapse coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the title owner of the Eternal and Time Dragon, only one step away from the final title, has begun to explore the field of time, and he entered the dark area is It was sent by the power of time that it was possible to establish a very accurate time coordinate system. How could this old man compare with him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the old man suddenly reached out and there was a small hourglass in his hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time sandglass flipped over, and the sand of the time fell. What shocked Richard most was not the accuracy of the hourglass, but its style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pure silver hourglass, the sand inside is a bright silver. This is a completely special time hourglass, even further than Richard's own time hourglass. Timeglasses like this should only be in the hands of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See a oracle in the dark area? Richard himself has some dare to believe such a thing. Although the old dragon constantly dispatches the gods to the dark areas, but he is responsible for building a time lighthouse in the dark areas, and pulling a piece of the area into the gods of the old dragon country, how should it not be the old man in front of Richard? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the real vision of Richard, I can't see the power of this old man. So he suddenly showed a silver time hourglass that made Richard so shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you are waiting for me?" Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the owner of the Elves, the owner of the Eternal and Time Dragon title, and... the young man with the responsibility of destruction and redemption Strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s words once again shocked Richard. After entering the realm of the super strong, Richard was faced with such a strange situation for the first time. He didn't even understand what kind of power the old man had grasped his information so clearly, and waited for three thousand years here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man seems to be able to understand Richard’s thoughts and sigh and say, “You have something on the body that bears fate. It tells me, I have to wait. The man is finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha involuntarily took a step back and pressed his hand on his chest. In the pocket there, the last piece of fat crystal plate is lying there quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the panic was only a matter of moments. Richard immediately calmed down and went to the old man and asked, "Then you have waited for me, I am going to let me do it." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want to go back to the original world?” The old man did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed and said, "Then you need to leave this. In the area, go to the dawning place. There is a way to go back there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyebrows of Richard are getting tighter and tighter, saying: "The land of dawn You have been waiting for me for three thousand years, just to say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the eternal and the dragon of the time is different. From ancient times to the present, the name of the dawn is only one person, that is, sand. The area where the sand is going to be developed is called the place of dawn. Although Richard fell to the dark area, he only had a short period of blank, and then established a precise and stable time coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand coming to the dark area is only a matter of years ago, but the old man is like saying thousands of years ago. From this point of view, this old thing is like a powerful liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the surface, Richard was quiet, but asked: "Where is the land of dawn? Which place is dawning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said slowly: "Dawn There is only one place, that is, the area to be opened by His Royal Highness. The Sandy Sacrifice sent me here to wait for you, just to tell you the way to the dawning place. But I did not think that this is actually three thousand years. ....."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Licha was shocked, but the surface said faintly: "As far as I know, the sand flowing out of the dark area is only a few years ago. Things haven't arrived for ten years, how can there be three thousand years? Unless you and I are not talking about one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man showed a clear smile and said "Of course we are talking about a person. In addition to the breaking sand, what kind of sand will be there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So why are you waiting for three thousand years?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time is hard to control now, especially in dark areas. I You should also see that the people who dispute the most are time. In fact, they are not wrong, because they all have their own system of passage of time. But on the other hand, it can be said that each of them is wrong. This is the dark area, it is not surprising that anything happens here. It is not impossible for me to wait for you for three thousand years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Seeing that his eyebrows wrinkled more and more tightly, he instinctively felt that the old man did not seem to lie, but he could not understand why such an incredible thing happened. Can it be said that during the period of his coma, it has actually passed for three thousand years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily put this question down and asked, "How should I go to the dawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old man’s palm is floating out of the silver hourglass. This time, a silver sand is spilled from the hourglass and falls on the ground, drawing a pattern that is difficult to understand. It should look like a map. It seems to have a route, but the pattern is messy and nothing can be seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently remembered this picture in his heart. In the eyes of other people, the chaotic pattern is a rather clear map in the eyes of Richard, but the map is still somewhat distorted, and the markings in many places are also blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard knows that this is because he is still affected by the distortion rules. Once you have fully analyzed the distortion rules, you will be able to see a clear and complete map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I have to do in the dawning place? Just to return?" Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, not only for the return. You have to rebuild the lighthouse of the time, complete the unfinished mission of the Sacred Sand, and then return to the eternal and timeless dragon. The old man answered very patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s eyebrows were almost locked together and asked, “So what is the sand? Where is she now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you arrive at the dawn, build a time lighthouse, you will naturally understand." The old man answered some mysteriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard gradually sank and asked: "Why can't you tell me now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the face of the momentum of Richard's gradual agility, the old man was very calm: "Because I can't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton remembered many of the Eternal Dragon Hall The secret that could not be said, the suspicion in my heart gradually went, and said, "Do you have anything to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man handed him a piece of Richard The dilapidated paper, said: "This is the way to build a time lighthouse, but I think you already know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the paper and swept it quickly. At a glance, nodded. Among the materials transmitted by Shen En, there is a complete method of establishing a light beacon in the dark areas. The old man's paper is a bit redundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do you need me to do for you now?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and said, "If you can, please give me a glass of water. I have not drunk water for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Waiting for me here." Richard stood up straight and said to the white bear: "Where can I find water?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." The white bear whispered. His mood is inexplicably low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
