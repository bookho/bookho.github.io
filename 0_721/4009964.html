			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of convective sand, Richard agrees deeply and says, "Yes. Ola's elf war songs and tired songs are really a weapon of war, and I don't know where he came from. If the other side also has a bard, it would be terrible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faro seems to have few bards, but you have to be wary of war sacrifices." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha nodded: "So Shande is also very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru Master The level is high enough, and the various curses of the Undead Master are a good means of restraining each other's sacrifices and priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still the twilight thing, I feel the power of divine power from her body, maybe she can learn to use some magic in the future." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time after the appearance of the twilight, and the first time that Richard talked about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is, um, how do you say..." Richard wants to explain, but his mind is floating up in his mind, "It is a kind of A special creature with divinity as its core resource. She has her own soul and thoughts, maybe... should we treat her as a real person?” For the mother nest, the divinity and the soul, Richard still knows less. Poor, I don't know how to accurately describe the characteristics of twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand frowning thought, did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the magic hourglass and slammed it on the sand ass and said, "Okay, time is almost up. Now, beautiful Miss Sands, you face There are two choices. First, I will go back immediately. I will go to the Baron Xiaofang Dan with me tomorrow to see what happened. Second, if you don't want to go, then we will do business right now!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quicksand quickly jumped out of Lichai’s arms, his face turned to the door, but his body did not retreat, and his back leaned into Richard’s arms. Her head leaned back and placed on Richard's shoulders, holding her hands back to Richard's waist, and then slowly and forcefully rubbing her back on the hips, spitting out from the small mouth of the micro-small mouth. A word that smells: "Can you do it, boy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it, don't you know?!" A bang, Richard only feels his body. If there is a volcanic burst, I can't stand it anymore. I directly put the sand on the big map. I attacked it in three or two times, and then it was bombarded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sand is hoarse and with a little hysteria, so that the fire inside the body is extremely fierce, almost impossible to hold. Looking at the drifting sand on the map, for a moment, Richard was a bit embarrassed, as if he was carrying the rivers and rivers of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand is such a hard time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war was fierce and lasting. When Richard finally subdued the gods, he felt tired and wanted to die, and he had to bless him in the uniformed sand. The energy of the magic, Richard also drank a bottle of energy to restore the pharmacy, under the triple effect of magic, decoration and potions, I felt better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flow of sand, Richard reluctantly cheered and began to finish the final finishing of the forest field. It took a full four hours to complete the work that could have been completed in two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard took off his clothes and soaked the structure drawn on the enchanted bark paper in a magical solvent, then counted the position and put his right chest chest. In an instant, the magic array on the enchanted bark paper suddenly lit up, and countless lines, such as the red gold wire, ablated in Richard's chest. This is comparable to the pain of a soldering iron, but Richard is almost used to it, just snorted, and if nothing happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking a few bottles of medicine to restore strength and stability, Richard’s mental strength has been successfully linked to the 'forest field', and then the feeling of the surrounding natural environment It began to become clearer, and the blood of the original, which was very vague, became stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what surprised Richard was that after the blood of the elf was strengthened, the inductive power of the Nolande string month was enhanced. In particular, the seventh string of red gold that was occasionally felt before, is now clear. The power of the seventh chord is that Richard has never used it successfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeatedly confirming that the body and the body were innocent, Richard began to meditate on rest. As for the spell penetration, this structure can be put back first, and it is not a problem to delay one or two months. After blessing the forest field, Richard’s induction of natural forces has been upgraded to a level that is not inferior to the same level of Druid. Therefore, Richard has some new ideas about the spell penetration structure. Once the idea is perfect, the spell penetration will be changed from the first-order structure to the second-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the second-order configuration, the super-magic effect is not very common. The effect of the second-order spell penetration can weaken the opponent's magic protection and resistance by two levels. For example, a mage who has a five-level magical sanctuary will have his shield equal to the third-level magical protection before the spell penetration effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another important point is that once a spell is made, it means that Richard has officially stepped into the ranks of the builders and become a real The builder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for Richard, the conceptual framework of the magical array has been completed, and the rest is only the calculation of details and material selection, just a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Richard is at the moment when he will step into the gate of the builders, he is very excited inside. He couldn't help but recall the life experiences of the sacred architects in the history of Noland. He wanted to see how many people could become architects when they were seventeen. If the number is small, does it mean that you have already occupied a place in the history of Noland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the result of the memory that made Richard a little frustrated. Among those who are sacred, there is absolutely no shortage of geniuses and gods, except St. Peter. Only when the year suddenly opened up and became the holy armor of the armed forces of the heavens, the other sacred sects were either enlightened very early, even became twelve or three years old, or they were very fast, and the rest were It is truly great wisdom. In fact, there is no shortage of people who are amazing in the history of Noland. There are many people who have become builders earlier than Richard. It’s just that most of these people stayed in the ranks of the builders for the rest of their lives. Very few have become big architects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard finally smiled and put all the excitement, expectation and embarrassment in his heart. Even if it is only a first-order construction, with the ‘Dark Breathing’ suit, he is enough to leave a trace of his own in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurried past in meditation overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Richard cleaned up the equipment, used breakfast, accompanied by entourage, and then escorted by ten barbarian warriors and thirty Shamin knights, and set off Go to the dusk castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
