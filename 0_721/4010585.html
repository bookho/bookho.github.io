			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the brigade went away, the dark Lin Hai was silent, and Richard’s cough was particularly clear, but it didn’t take long for a beast to scream Richard's coughing sound, a mutant elf rushed to Richard, but the result was wearing on the moonlight, Richard just stepped back, the long knife pointed upward, let the mutant elf himself hit the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several mutated elves that appear from behind and flanking to Richard, but a faint figure flashes a few times and they are all cut. In two paragraphs, the water splash appeared immediately beside Richard, slightly behind the half-step, as in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smashed the moonlight and smashed the mutated elf wearing it, saying: "A group of people without souls, but the number will be many, afraid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of little demon, what is terrible." Shuihua said somewhat bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, she suddenly plunged into the forest, and returned to the original place like a ghost, as soon as she entered the room, there was a strong smell of stench in the forest. That is the smell of black blood after the mutant elf is killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua instantly kills several mutant elves, but it’s obviously more, and the mutated elves appear like wolves, slowly approaching them. Most of them come from the ground, and a few climb up to the surrounding ancient trees, condescending, and look at Richard and the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the splash, there is a cold smashing machine, the hands are flat and the guide of the eternal sleep, step forward, the long knife is half a circle from left to right, a circle of invisible fluctuations Spilled from the blade, until twenty meters away, where the fluctuations passed, all the mutant elves suddenly stopped moving forward, and a few cracks appeared on the trunks of several ancient trees, but they were almost deep Cut off the entire old tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the cuts on the mutant elves that have stopped the action, and then the upper and lower halves slide off right and wrong, and the water is smashed, killing Dozens of mutated elves, if faced with the guardian elves, her knife is enough to shock the opponent, but the mutated elves have no fear at all, they make a sharp whistle and start a full-speed impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shui Shui screamed and turned into a virtual shadow, rushing toward the mutant elves, and the flesh and blood flew in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not good at frontal fights, just to attract more attention to the mutated elves, so that I can share some pressure, but the number of mutated elves is too much, and there are still many rushing to Richard, a rush, and a wave. The knives are sloping, and the invisible volatility will once again bring dozens of mutated elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is leaning on the big tree, the moonlight is pointing upwards, and a mutant elf jumps from the blade. The result is directly open, and the moonlight falls immediately. A fallen genie was smashed, and Richard turned around the old tree for a half circle. He took a long knife and stabbed it from under the ribs. He pierced the two mutant elves behind the tree and escaped one. The slay of the mutant elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scrapping to the right!" Suddenly, the sound of Richard sounded in the sense of water. She did not think about it and immediately returned to the place designated by Richard. In the five years of the field battlefield, she has formed an obedience in obedience to Richard's orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha left the big tree he had defended, brushed a few knives to cut around the mutant elves, rushed to another big tree, he stuck The big tree circled around and immediately let some of the mutant elves lose their targets. When they reacted, Richard had already rushed to another big tree ten meters away. As for the two mutant elves in the middle, they didn’t know themselves. How was it cut down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark forest, Splash and Richard are running counter to each other, each igniting a group of mutant elves. When they are 100 meters apart, they change direction and draw a perfect After the semicircle, it is gathered again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a hand and shouted in consciousness: "Forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two The man then walked side by side and rushed out from the weak area surrounded by the mutated elves. In this way, Richard and the water bloom time and time, constantly moving in the forest, the complex terrain of the forest is no longer the advantage of the mutant elf, but instead becomes Their biggest disadvantage, perhaps because they have been suppressed for a long time, may be to share the pressure for Richard, the killing of the water is extremely heavy, and there will always be a powerful virtual cut, which is one of her killings. Great, but not too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And although Richard does not make much power, but at this moment his art of fighting is at its peak, without using more power, it is legend The strong will not do better than him. Richard’s action is slow and slow at this moment, and the moonlight is even more of a ghost. The killing does not require a second knife. In terms of the number of killings, it’s not much less than the water, knowing to kill It’s a dozen lives to make a squid of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the case, they gradually feel the pressure, the number of mutant elves is too much, as if they can never be killed, the gap between the water and the hollow cuts is getting longer and longer, and the cough of Richard is getting more and more intense, the moonlight is still It’s erratic, but more is placed there in advance, killing the enemy with the help of the mutated elves, but Richard still feels that the moonlight is getting heavier and heavier. He counts his magic like a savage miser. Consumption and supplementation, but also to suppress the gray gas in the body still uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to kill, even when the water flower felt a little numb, a time point that Richard had already set was finally triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not keep it, and started the life, the moonlight suddenly fierce, and the knife fell in flesh and blood, he pushed in the flock of mutant elves, like The flesh-and-blood machine, the spewing blood directly splashed a few meters away. In the blink of an eye, Richard was plowing a fleshy promenade in the mutant elf, killing the encirclement, pulling the water and flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutated elf is in a chaos, and then chasing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and the waters rushed through the forest, even if they were exhausted, the speed was much faster than the mutant elves behind them, and the distance between the two sides gradually opened. However, the mutant elf is chasing after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running and running, Richard suddenly felt that the whole body was loose, and the heavy pressure that had been pressing on him for many days had disappeared. Here, the forest will finally become Normal, no more comprehensive suppression, no longer shielding the consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a deep breath, and the perception immediately spread out, the consciousness extended to the limit, and hundreds of times in an instant The node that can be contacted, this feeling can not be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mutated elf did not hesitate to chase it out, the volley rushed to Richard, and Li suddenly turned around, shouting, the moonlight brought a sickle , greeted the mutant elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost for a moment, the guardian elf became a bloody flower in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the suppression of the will of the forest, Richard immediately suppressed the violent gas in the body, and the strength increased sharply, almost recovering from the heyday. Half of the strength, this half-strength, under the effect of the peak combat skills and the ash of everything, the upper mutated elves are completely crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mutated elves that constantly rushed out of the forest, Richard did not say a word, and the knife rushed to the head to kill him. This time, his body not only shines with the magical light, but also the life is absolutely starting, in a blink of an eye, Li Inspected in the mutant elf to kill a round trip, flesh and blood overflowing into a pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the mutated elf who does not know the fear, but at the moment, he does not dare to attack, but he continually whispers on the ground, they have no fear, but they still have life to survive. A little instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took the splash that was about to rush, shook his head, slowly retreated into the forest, and the mutant elves squirmed and tried to chase After a short distance, they all stopped and turned around in uneasiness. The normal forest environment made them feel extremely uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the black robe and the elders of the guardian elves appeared on the final battlefield. The black robe was silent, but the elders’ faces were all It’s awe-inspiring. One of the elders who are good at tracking and hunting can’t care for the bloody bodies, carefully inspected them for a long time, and even picked up a few pieces of broken bodies to repeatedly test the wounds, then muttered to himself: “Really... ...only two people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is light, but the presence is always strong, how can you not hear clearly, the body of the black robe begins Trembling, apparently angered to the extreme, he just said that three thousand mutant elves can kill opponents, but now the other side is only two people broke, let his three thousand "powerful" mutant elves die and hurt more than half, this slap, It was a little louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base city is busy at this time, all the troops are mobilizing and preparing for the war, although the war will not break out immediately, the knights who have just returned Need a rest treatment, the Yongye elves also need to be resettled, but when Richard returns to the base city, he only leaves a sentence: "Be prepared for all wars within three days." Then he returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Eternal Dragon Hall, the Nolan Grand priest rushed in, and when he saw Richard lying in the temple, he couldn’t help but whisper, in her eyes, On the body of Richard, there was a black air that was not scattered, and the various sacred sects in the black gas continued to emerge. Nolan saw the power of strong rules in the black air, even in the black of the Eternal Dragon Hall. The gas is still uneasy, and I want to break through and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to make it like this." Nolan slightly blamed, not waiting for Richard to answer, she began to sing a spell, the power of a huge time quickly Converging, she condensed into a strip of light gold in her body, her hands turned over, the power of time was washed like water on the body of Richard, eroding the black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
