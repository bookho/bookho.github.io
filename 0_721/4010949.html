			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with Richard’s powerful talent, this moment can only be recorded There are about a thousand symbols in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This symbol is a new language that can explain the rules, and the level is above the language found by Noland. As long as you master this rune, then Richard's mastery of the rule power will immediately take another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard is already stunned by the incredible power of this group! Do not say anything else, the rules represented by the outer shield are already comparable to the rules he has solved in the Nest of the Shulan. But to resolve this rule, you must first master the new rune! The combination of the two is naturally self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just to open the shield, just to meet the most basic requirements to touch the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei is completely unimaginable, what kind of existence is the ability to control this light, and what kind of power can exist to put this light into This old and mysterious library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the level of tyranny of the abyss lord and devil Iscara is qualified and capable to try to control this light. However, they are obviously inconsistent with the genus of this group of light. If it is encountered, it is mostly a big bang that can destroy the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that his current level was not enough to touch it, so he looked at the light group again, and after writing down some runes, he began to look at it. Other books in the library are borrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a try, Richard found that three books and a slate shield could be quickly cracked. In addition, there are seven books that can be cracked in a certain period of time. These eleven books are the limits that he can currently read. Others have not yet started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stayed in the library for a whole day and cracked the shield that was the easiest to crack. Then he found that after mastering the rules, the shield still existed, but he could go in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the three books are an exposition of the power of elements, and one is the origin and composition of various forms of life. None of these three books directly enhances the power, but the knowledge contained therein plays a key role in enhancing the understanding of world rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief review, Richard discovered that the three books describe the general rules of transcending planes, which are comparable to the underlying rules that form the basis of a plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the book about the origin of life, Richard just read a chapter, many doubts immediately solved, the analysis of the underlying rules of the Greenson plane is greatly Ascension, at once, I took control of six of the sixteen underlying rules! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slate is the entry for the mysterious runes of the shield. This is a rune from an ancient race star. Its structure and rules are different from the gods and demons in the current world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By learning the contents of the slate, you can master the most basic rules of runes, and then gradually master a specific rune. When each rune is constructed, it will correspond to a special rule. As for the number of characters, it is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three books and a slate are not digested in a short period of time. To break the remaining seven books, the time required is in years. However, when Richard mastered the runes, the process will be greatly shortened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These books can't be taken away from the library, and Richard has been in the semi-position for a long time. He left the library and continued to search. Finally found the control area of ​​the semi-plane. After the half-plane of the general mage is formed, it cannot move any more. Su Hailun has the inheritance of ancient stars and has established a system that can drive half-plane transmission flight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy used to move the semi-plane is astronomical, but after having a piece of energy-absorbing tree, energy is no longer a problem. Nothing is missing in the void, that is, there is no shortage of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about it, and stood in front of the cāo console, putting his hands on the two metal balls in front of him. The next moment, Richard's consciousness is linked with the entire semi-plane control system. He enters the coordinates of his own half-face in consciousness and activates the plane transmission system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flash of light, the half-plane slowly moved, and in front of it there was a vaguely large portal. The half plane slowly enters the portal and then disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s departure, a near-transparent figure emerged in this void, and he looked at the empty void and couldn’t help but scorn. One voice, said to himself: "It should be here! How has it disappeared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the upper body is a human figure, and the lower part of the body is composed of tentacles. The monster suddenly changes its face and screams into the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just where he was standing, a pair of knives crossed, but only a few tentacles were cut. The emptiness of the sky has gone all the way, and the half-man and half-blame guy has escaped far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha hand-held moonlight, coming out of the void, the eyes are all cold and cold. He looked at the tentacles that were still twisting in the void, sneer: "Since I found it, you still want to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a tentacle, the real talents are seen, and only the touch of the hand reveals the sè silk, most of which point to a certain direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the line of destiny, as long as there is a certain connection between the two, it will be brought together by the line of destiny. This is the most essential principle of prophetic spells and one of the underlying rules that make up the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real talent of Richard is now more and more powerful. When he is fully operational, he can already see the flow of some of the world's bottom rules in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard was ready to follow the line of destiny, the silk suddenly began to tremble violently, and instantly became messy, and then one root disappeared! In the end, there were only a few faint silk threads left by Richard in the tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted, iron sè iron blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just read four books in the library left by the ancient stars, and the understanding of the world has reached a new level before he can regain his true talent. The ability to see the line of destiny for a short time. I did not expect that this half-human and half-monster guy actually has the power to influence the line of destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the fate, this cut off all the clues that Richard has traced. Only in this case, the connection between the destiny and the fate of one's own body is actually equivalent to cutting off a small piece of soul, and the loss can be described as heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is decisive and decisive. At first glance, Richard immediately fled, without any lingering and hesitation, and he did not hesitate to break the fate. This only shows that he knows very well about Richard, and he has been thinking about Richard for more than two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one scholar scholar who has this mysterious ability and constantly wants to attack the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this guy verified a speculation of Richard, that is Su Hailun’s sudden disappearance, and probably also related to the scholar’s ​​mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific Master, is also a scholar mages! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main unfortunate encounters of Richard in recent years are almost all related to scholars. These guys are hidden in the dark, and they are self-contained by human leaders, but they always seek loyalty with yīn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Richard has a huge force, accumulated huge wealth, and he gradually moved to the peak of the whole Noland, but he could not find these scholars. The trace of the mage can only be passively beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s counterattack is equally fierce, and as soon as he discovers the trace of the scholar’s ​​mage, he immediately kills at all costs. It’s just that it’s still passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stood in the void for a while before it was sent away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Su Hailun’s half-plane appeared in the airspace of Richard’s half-plane, and the two-half planes gradually approached, hundreds of kilometers apart. When it stopped, then Richard Cāo locked them in the drive system. His little half-plane began to rotate around the half-face of Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in Richard’s consciousness, there is another option: half-plane fusion. If this option is executed, the two half-planes will merge into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to close this option, he did not believe that Su Hailun would die so simply. She is more likely to be trapped somewhere. It may be a place where even the soul can be restrained, and it is temporarily cut off from the semi-position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-faced dú lì is a symbol, as long as her half-plane is still there, it symbolizes that she is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, even if Su Hailun can't be found, Richard believes that he also has the last resort: the dragon of eternal and time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old dragon can let Richard see this episode in the past, then it must have a way to find the whereabouts of Su Helun. The difference is just to see how much it costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
