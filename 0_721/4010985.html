			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the magic map, several streams of light are constantly expanding. The army of the Crimson Kingdom is rapidly retracing, but the southernmost legion wants to withdraw to the Blue Water Oasis City, which also takes a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northeastern coastal coast, a huge will is repeatedly sweeping. This is the will of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the warnings of the three goddesses, the Faro gods paid their attention to the area where the reaper was infested. However, no matter how hard the gods worked, in their perception, the coastal area was completely covered in a dark fog, and it was impossible to see what was happening inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northernmost cold rock kingdom has Xerxes and another church with a weak god, and now both gods have lowered their gods, let A team of scouts in the church sent a knight to the East Coast area to see what happened there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church knights just started, they saw a black cloud in the distance. It is thousands of miniature and small fighters, and there are hundreds of huge transport ships at the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights have never seen such a scene, and most people stay on the spot for a while. And a few quick reactions immediately turned and fled at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their horses couldn’t run through the plane any more, and dozens of beams of light fell in the sky, and they immediately turned these knights into sieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, the fleet of the Reaper of the Brigade appeared in the sky of the largest city in the eastern part of the Cold Rock Kingdom. The transport ship hovered at a low altitude of more than ten meters, and the cabin was wide open, putting tens of thousands of flesh-and-blood warriors directly into the city. In addition, a dozen or so transport vessels laid down a large number of mechanical beetles. They stayed outside the city and began to clean up snow, level the land and build a slaughterhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city has a population of more than 40,000, and it has completely become a dead city in less than half an hour. After another ten minutes, dozens of transport spacecraft took off and returned to the city. Everything in the entire city has become a piece of meat in the cargo hold of the transport ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reapers gathered in one place and started moving in the next city. This is a small city, even the slaughter belt processing, but only consumes the harvester for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the black frenzy quickly spread throughout the cold rock kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When several reconnaissance beasts in the kingdom were also wiped out, Richard knew that the cold rock kingdom with a population of five million was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the cold rock kingdom was overwhelmed by the reaper frenzy, the gods finally acted. Xerxes first passed down the shrine and launched a comprehensive jihad call to all his followers. The God of Stability wants believers to take up arms, fight for the defense of faith, fight for survival, and fight for their homeland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Xerxes, the gods issued a call for jihad one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Horn is played in various countries in Faro! A personal and non-human country has begun to mobilize. Although the king and the aristocrats do not understand it, the gods that accompany the miracles are the highest level of summoning, so they still obey, open the warehouse and distribute the weapons to In the hands of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise and intelligent people are all terrified, this is clearly the rhythm of the entire plane mobilization! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing has only happened once in history, that is the battle of the invasion of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s face was always gloomy, and no other orders were issued except for the command of the legions to speed up the retracement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mex sat next to Richard, apparently feeling the suppression of the atmosphere, so surprisingly did not find any trouble for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, another unexpected news came. A small-scale force of the Reaper did not know when it crossed the vast unmanned area and appeared in a city east of the Iron Triangle Empire and Richard's scheduled defense line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of this unit is not large, and the city of the Iron Triangle Empire was formerly a military fortress, and there are still heavy troops stationed at the moment. An elite unit of the mother's nest happened to be on the left, so after a bloody battle, the reaper's army was completely annihilated. However, the coalition forces of the Brood Warrior and the Iron Triangle Empire have also suffered more than half of the casualties. The population of 90,000 in the city has killed nearly 40,000 people! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the attack, Saranwell, who had been commanding defense on the defense line, arrived at the city for the first time, and the mother’s nest also mobilized four brains. With a large number of worker bees rushing, the worker bees will clean up the bodies of the city, while the brains will continue to transmit the sights to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has become a hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the outer edge of the city, the reaper set up two slaughterhouses with unique efficiency. A large number of bodies have been sent to the abattoir for 'processing'. When the troops of the mother's nest arrived, the reaper's troops were completely smashed, and even the mechanical beetles began to join the battle. Therefore, there are a large number of corpses that have been cut to half in the abattoir and have not yet been able to be compressed and packaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, a transport spacecraft was destroyed on the ground, its cargo compartment was broken, and a large number of fleshy cargo blocks were sprinkled everywhere. Some of the blocks outside the block of meat broke, and flesh, viscera and broken bones flowed out of the inside and flowed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors of the Iron Triangle Empire saw this scene, although they were all veterans who had been through the field, but many people could not help but vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville’s face was scary, and he immediately ordered his own troops to block the scene, to isolate the city from the abattoir, and not to allow the surviving residents of the city. See this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sharon Will walked into the abattoir with his escort, and handed out a complete corpse and put it aside, those that had been cut The bodies were piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abattoir is filled with tens of thousands of bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville moved one by one, completely ignoring the whole body has been soaked in blood. Hundreds of human-shaped knights came to the abattoir to help, and the progress was accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire abattoir was not cleared until the twilight time. The intact bodies were placed on the ground in rows, which looked shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse and fleshy pieces were piled up into several hills, and Saranwell poured a can of fire oil on it, and the Imperial Warrior continued to give The corpse is filled with oil. When the oil was soaked in the corpse, Saranwell condensed a fireball in his hand and cast it on the corpse. The fire immediately rose to the sky, rolling black smoke straight into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire reflected that the face of Salenwell was flickering, and every line on his face was as deep as carrying countless pains and responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tear Lenwell waved to the sky, and after a moment a brain split from the sky and fell in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to talk to His Highness Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, a few flashes of the eye, it sounded Richard’s voice: "I am, Salenwei ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also saw this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw more More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell nodded and said: "There was a corps of the empire here, and later the ancestral reinforcements arrived, only to destroy the enemy. But look at this battlefield, I can only say that we actually lost. Your Highness, you are right, the reapers are really terrible, they are almost invincible. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville’s expression is extraordinarily calm and calm: “His Highness, I know that you can only take away a small number of people. Most people have to stay in Faro, face The reaper. And everything that happens here is their future destiny. But they are my people, I am their emperor. At this time, I can't leave them and flee from Faro!"<br / ><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Skull took a deep breath and said in a word: "I decided to stay with my people. When the reaper's army arrived, their emperor should Standing at the forefront!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Richard said: "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Salenville's gaze is through the layers of time and space, falling on Richard, and finally glanced at him deeply, then turned and strode away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oasis City, Richard let all followers leave, standing alone in front of the map of Faro, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the king city of the Holy Tree Dynasty, a small group of church members braved the wind and snow, and soon came to an old church and rang A thick black iron door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the iron door opened a slit, and an old, hazy face appeared in the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an old priest dressed in a white robe. He looked up and down the door, and his face was full of vigilance. It is strange to say that both sides are the clerics of the Glorious Church, but the old priest is like a thief to guard against the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the clergy outside the door, suddenly one person came out. He opened his hood and revealed his face. He said, "I am looking for the Archbishop of China."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest was suddenly shocked and lost his voice: "His Highness!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after recognizing the person, he not only did not let the road open, but instead blocked the door more tightly, as if he was afraid that the other party would come in. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then courtyard sounded a hoarse voice: "Let them come in." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " But..." The old priest was obviously reluctant. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "It does not matter, let them come in." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This old Priest tugged iron The door, put St. Martin and his party in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked up at the ancient and magnificent church arcade and told the accompanying samurai to wait outside the church and walked in alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the altar of the church, the Archbishop of China has a high crown, wearing a red robe of the Cardinal Archbishop, holding a holy book in his hand, is carefully Read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Martin came in, Hua Wen put the holy ceremony in his hand and said to Martin: "You should not come in. Here is my field now. Even if you are The Son, in this church, is only a part of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin is not nervous, continue to go to Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of Hua Wen flashed, and several flash chains appeared in the void, and the volley was placed on Martin, and he was firmly locked in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin struggled several times in a row, the whole body flashed, and countless gods fluttered around, but at most they could only open these chains more and more. Just can't break. As long as these chains are constant, Martin will not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua Wen picked up a short sword from the altar, soaked in the holy pool next to him, walked to Martin, calmly put the sword on his Neck, gently pull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
