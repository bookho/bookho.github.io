			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city of nearly 10,000 people, when all the resistances are killed The town bears also felt a little tired. The buzz of the lion was uploaded in the central square of the city, which was the message of calling the bear knight in the town. So all the town bear knights have left their hands dead or have a breath of prey, and they have gathered in the direction of the snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magician’s voice spread throughout the city with the power of magic: “Everyone puts down their arms! Those who dare to hold weapons, once discovered, Gege kill!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the mage’s sentence is useless. Anyone who wants to resist is not dead or fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knights dispersed again, and the housekeepers drove out the people in the building and rushed to the square to gather. When everyone saw the huge lion in front of the square, they couldn't help but tremble. This behemoth is two or three times larger than the largest Warcraft Thunder Lizard in the blood-stained land. There was a woman who couldn’t control herself and began to scream. She was immediately dragged out by the town bear knight and cut directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair stood on the top of the lion's head, laughing innocently, and the bright lips were red and dazzling, like blood. Her eyes swept across the audience, and everyone couldn't help but chill, as if she had stared at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Sinclair, from now on is your master! Your life and death are in my hands. I like quietness and obedience, I also like beautiful things! If you please me, you can live. If you dare to resist, even the slightest resistance, this is the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair One move, the crowd immediately flew out of an ordinary middle-aged man. Her figure flashed on the top of the lion's head, and appeared from behind the middle-aged man. The knife flashed in his hand and then reappeared on the top of the lion's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her hand, she has a long, short knife. I don’t know when it’s contaminated with a thick, hot blood, as if it’s life, rolling on the edge. I have never fallen. Sinclair glanced at his hands and shocked. The blood stuck on the blade flew out, leaving only a dark blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at the middle-aged man with disgust, and said coldly: "A 13-level waste in the district, I want to play tricks in front of me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man fell to the ground and couldn’t climb anymore. He barely propped up his upper body and shook his fingers at Sinclair, wanting to say something, but A syllable can't be sent out. A red line suddenly appeared on his face, and then the body was divided into four pieces, and the blood and internal organs immediately flowed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people in the crowd stunned, and then they smothered their mouths and dared not let the cry out. Sinclair’s eyes passed over them, but there was no further indication. Only two magicians know that she is not tolerant, but lazy. It is time for her to enjoy and entertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you, and you... give me out!" Sinclair was in a position. The people she pointed to came out honestly, standing in a row, shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and beautiful men and women who are listed are all 20 people, half male and half female. Seeing this is not an exaggerated number, so the two magicians knew that Sinclair had been stifled so tiredly. Although he wanted to indulge, it was not particularly excessive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair casually pointed to a building that looked taller and taller than the surrounding buildings, and asked the town bear to bring a group of people to clean the hall first, and then ordered the young men and women who were ordered out: "All Stripping!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the handsome young men and women are hesitant. Although Sinclair’s order did not dare to disobey, but undressing in front of the city, it is difficult for people to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a little hesitation, a magician shoots a magic missile from his fingertips and hits a girl who has no movement at all. Hit the flight out of the queue. Next to the town bear knight, he picked up the heavy hammer and squatted on the girl, giving a sound of the fruit being shattered. Splashing flesh and blood instantly spilled on the young men and women and let them scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" The magician’s words made most of the men and women immediately snoring, but there were two girls who couldn’t help but scream, so they were dragged Out of the team, the throat was cut directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner has no patience and no noise. All you have to do is to hear every word she has told me and follow it. Now, let it go! Don't do it again. If you change it, you will change the batch." The magician's voice is as cold as the northern ice. If you change the next batch, then the fate of this batch will naturally be consistent with the three girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no silence in the square, no one protested, no one protested, and no one fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair ordered three more girls to make up the number, and the handsome young men and women took off their clothes at the fastest speed and then trembled to wait for the next fate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the hall has been cleaned, and Sinclair blew all the red/naked playthings into it, then laughed arrogantly and even put his clothes directly. They were all stripped off, and the black armor with a small amount of material was left on the street and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and then reached out to a handsome teenager: "You! Come over, take all your skills and make me comfortable.... Get the tricks, go straight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager is suddenly stunned by her, and the male sign naturally shrinks under extreme panic. Sinclair was furious and reached into his chest, crushing the heart of the boy! She waved her hand and the juvenile's body flew out of the gate and fell to the center of the square. She also heard her sharp roar from the door: "Useless waste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair grabbed a weak girl, slap her two slaps The nose and mouth bleed, then fell to the ground and threw it. Then, under her direction, a young man trembled and slammed on the naked back of Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, in a twinkling of an eye, it becomes a sinister and bloody world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people gathered in the square were allowed to disperse, and the two magicians patrolled on several battlefields where there was a fierce confrontation and began to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sanctuary of the oasis at dusk was solved by Sinclair, the town bears were not met. But the city has over a thousand soldiers, and many of them are high-ranking, so the battle is quite fierce. There are five town bear knights who died on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the city, the magicians found that a town bear knight fell to the ground, and could not climb. He had two long rifles and a two-handed epee in his body, and there was a horrible big hole in his back. Through the hole, you can see the creepy internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
