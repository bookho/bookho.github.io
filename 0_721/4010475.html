However, Mr. Essin, or I should call you a god, the god also has a name, but I don’t know how much you occupy in the soul of this body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essin’s face changed and said, “You already know, why don’t you attack me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李哈哈哈A smile, the wave is also a large piece of mist with a strong life, landing on the castle, so the seemingly inanimate castle is singularly twisted, turned into a big beach can not tell what is black sticky Something, when it comes into contact with water mist, the surface is like being splashed with strong acid, burned and smoked. It has no facial features at all, but it does not know where to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essien has done his best and wants to rush to Richard, but hesitated and did not dare. Richard looked at him and sneered: "I just don't I want to destroy Essien's body too much. If you dare to come up, the body you are hiding inside is small, but I don't mind ruining it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You..." Essien had already found two long fangs from his mouth, but he did not dare to really come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer pays attention to Essien, but rises again by tens of meters, condescending, and a magical storm blasts to the dark black monster below, it Howling, struggling, but being bombarded by Richard is getting thinner and thinner, and the voice is becoming more and more desperate. Richard is constantly bombarding it. Every time it is washed with lightning or flame, it will be life again. The mist of the breath is soaked again, so that the sick star monster can no longer be born again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole plane vibrated a bit, and all the undead creatures climbed out from the ground. They were struggling this time, and the body surface did not break open. A small crack, flying out of a large group of palm-sized black things, it is also a monster with no shape, like a piece of black cloth flying, but they are too many, tens of thousands into black clouds When they rushed to Richard, the flesh and blood of the body would be squandered in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately waved his destiny, and he blessed himself with a very strong magical hood. This magical hood also has a life-like atmosphere. They burned up immediately, but they were so many. In a blink of an eye, Richard was heavily wrapped up and turned into a huge black ball in the air, but in the black ball, suddenly a few red lights flashed. The red light turned more and more, and finally a huge flaming fireball appeared in the air, engulfing all the black fragments...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball was eventually attributed to smoke, leaving a sly magic mask at the center. Richard surrounded his knees and huddled in the reticle like a baby. He looked up and looked at the stunned Essien with a playful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic mask was broken, and Richard re-stretched his body and stood in the air, saying, "This is your last resort. It is really good, it is consumed." I am the magic of a nine-level magic, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essie smiled bitterly: "You won, I will send you out."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "There is a very popular phrase in the plane I came to: Never trust a god."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Essien’s extremely unwilling roar, Richard waved a pillar of fire and split the shrine of the castle into ashes. As the gods disappeared, Essien also twisted. Next, then, as the candle is melted, it falls to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle disappeared, cracks began to appear on the hill, and soon it became a huge ground crack. The whole mountain was split into more than a dozen pieces, one piece down Sinking, there is dark water pouring out of the cracks, filling the gaps in the mountains, and flowing to the earth, the scene of the heavens and nights is also constantly broken, as if it is broken crystals, pieces fall down, Where the castle was originally located, you can see a group of rotating black lights, which are the exits to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the half-face that was becoming ridiculous at the foot. It was a pity, but it was impossible. He is still unable to control a half-plane. Then, with a sigh, he flew directly into the exit of the semi-planet. Behind Richard, the black water was turned into a huge wave and went straight into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods don’t know how long it took to run this half-plane, and put a lot of effort into it, just look at the separation of the gods placed here, and the number of undead Creatures can be known, but now they are completely destroyed by Richard. In the final analysis, it is the life rules that Richard has learned that have played a huge role. The life of the rules is far more intense than ordinary nature or life magic. Only the magic from the power of God can be compared with it. After any attack by Richard, the damage to the gods or the spirit of death is doubled, even if the life is added, even if it is utilized. The combination of wisdom and magical reincarnation has greatly increased the scale of magic, and Richard has consumed more than half of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destruction of the half-face is a blow to the gods, and Richard hopes to help others in this way, if the other four are also trapped in half In the plane, the only thing that Richard is worried about is the splash. The girl has been strengthening her ability to kill and kill. There are not many means of warfare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the portal, Richard found himself in the midair of a very tall hall, falling down, and dozens of thumb-thick tentacles were wrapped around the floor, in the middle of the hall, squatting A completely indescribable monster, it has a radius of tens of meters, about 20 meters high, it can not see the shape at all, the body surface is completely viscous, and there are constantly broken legs, faces or internal organs. And then pressed down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking in the distance, it’s like cutting up countless people and animals, and then picking up something that comes together, seeing it at first sight Licha actually had a feeling of wanting to vomit, followed by a pungent sour odor, which made Richard’s stomach shrink strongly, and he had to use some magic to suppress the discomfort. Going down, as for the tentacles, naturally they can't make them close, and Richard once again pulls out the elf's long knife, like a slow and fast knife and flutters around, and cuts all the tentacles that are stretched out into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following pile of things that don’t know what’s going on surface surface shows a huge face, staring fiercely at Richard, roaring: “I will tear you away, mortal Broken, always becomes the dirtiest and humble part of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes suddenly shot a strong light, and the giant face below immediately became shocked. The expression of fear, angered and said: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the perspective of Richard, the mass of broken meat has disappeared, and the entire hall has become If not, all that can be seen in the horizon is the flow of energy. When the analysis evolves into insight, ordinary obstacles can no longer block Richard's line of sight. Only articles of special strength can shield Richard's perception of energy. The huge god is a group of creeping shadows. It can't maintain a shape. It changes constantly. Sometimes there is some energy off the body and free from all sides. But the walls of the hall are very solid energy. Wall, the energy scattered by the gods touches the walls, God will be bounced back to the body of sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this, Richard was already aware of it and snorted and said, "I said that in a stable plane, how could a sudden emergence of a god? If it is a true god, it has long been annihilated by the ruler's rule power. You are just a monster created by man. It is only a little godly character. You can't even go out of this painful hall. What is the prestige?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great god is extremely angry and screams: "Your biggest mistake is not to walk into this painful temple, here, It belongs to my field, and you don't have much magic now. I see how long you can resist my suffering and cry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
