			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand became a thirteenth-level magician, and Io was even more The peak of the sixteenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde has finally stepped into the fifteenth grade, and the optimized structure has been promoted by Richard to a full second-order suit, plus the epic level in his hand. The giant axe, as well as the specially cultivated magic rider, his comprehensive strength finally reached the level of Noland's standard construction knight. Back to Nolande, although still can not go sideways, but it is also a small figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the natural enemies of Gangde, the girl’s splash is now fifteen. The two sides have the same level, and the girl relies on the powerful power of the secret guide, and still suppresses Gangde. And Gangde tried to get back to the scene several times on the wine field, but he was easily overturned by the girl, so he only sighed and sighed when he saw the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranks of the Oral Archers and the Bards have increased by one level, reaching Levels 10 and 12 respectively, and Sandru, which has not benefited for a long time. Finally, I went further and reached the thirteenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them seem to have only Richard standing still, and the magic is on the fifteenth level. But after the war, all those who are familiar with Richard think that he has changed. It is difficult to express in words if there is something different. It just feels that if Richard was a lake before, it is like the sea now, and people can no longer see through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surface, Richard is only a little less, not so funny, and he starts drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day of the war, the army finally withdrew from the battlefield. The hill, and the Gobi as a battlefield, has since been called the land of sacrifice to commemorate the 50,000 soldiers who died in this battle. And the flag that Richard once succumbed to, still fluttering on the land of sacrifice, has not fallen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of Noland prisoners were bought by Richard in his own name and turned into slaves, actually being incorporated into his own army. As for the dead Nolan soldiers, according to Faro's tradition, they should dismember the body and feed the vultures and wild dogs. This is a god that cannot be changed, and it is a tradition that has not changed for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard left the nest, in the presence of aristocrats, let the mother's nest engulf the remains of all Noland warriors. Although this slightly changed the gods, it did not violate the big principle, and no one said anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Lanshui Oasis City, the nobles returned to their respective territories. The next is a tough time. They have to pay for the soldiers and try to rebuild their armaments. It is like a lion who won a bloody battle, and he has to lick a wound in a quiet corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond was placed in a separate room, usually not allowed to step out of the door. Only one hour a day can be used for activities in the courtyard downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a new life in his body, but the magic continues to decline until the eight levels are stabilized. The resolution of the hen's nest to humans has reached 230%, so it is not difficult to maintain Raymond's life for a period of time and suppress his magic. As long as the mother's nest stops supplying Raymond with a life-sustaining liquid, Raymond will die within a week, and in the process it will experience the pain of the rapid infusion of all injected life energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day in the blue water oasis city, Raymond was sitting in the room, staring at the sky of Faro. At this time the door opened, a girl dressed up in a clean and clean way came in, she carried a tray with a few meals on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it on the table over there!" Raymond said indifferently, without looking back, still staring at the sky. There is nothing but a bed, a table, a chair and a cupboard in this house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The girl replied. But when she heard her voice, Raymond jumped like an electric shock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the girl, his face changed, and finally he returned to calm and a little lonely. He sat back in the chair and said in a gentle and soft habit: "珞琪, I didn't expect you to be here. Why, did Richard regard you as a maid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 stretched out his arms and showed off his clothes and said, “Would the maid wear such clothes?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond It was discovered that the girl actually wore a robe of a mage apprentice, just for the convenience of movement, and bundled her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an apprentice of Richard?" Raymond felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi smiled and said: "Apprentice, assistant, and lover. Well, the latter is exactly the bed partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s city is deeper, and his face can’t help but change. After he has faded all the amazing aura, he is just a young man in his twenties. And most of his wisdom is manifested in territorial management and plane warfare. Even if I had expected it, I suddenly heard such a message, but my heart hurts and I can't breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed a few times to cover up the changes in his expression, although he has not coughed up now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond turned and looked out the window and asked, "Apprentice, um, what do you study with Richard now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi’s answer made Raymond stunned and couldn’t help but look back at Qi Qi It seems that she has never seen her before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it unexpected?" Qi Qi casually pulled her hair and the horsetail jumped. She looked at Raymond and said calmly: "If the Joseph family knew that I had this talent, I am afraid I would not sit and watch the Mensa family dismiss the marriage contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Raymond said with a wry smile: "The things of the year were not that simple. At that time I... I knew I couldn't live for too long. So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I sit down and watched the old metamorphosis that I was given to Bear Peter. Is it?" In the eyes of Qi Qi, she suddenly shot a sharp light, and Raymond did not dare to look at it and lowered her gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a huge benefit, the entire family of Schumpeter. The Joseph family did not have the ability to compensate for the Mensa family, unless ... solved with war." In addition to the smile, Raymond still smiles. In the face of family survival, personal love/sex is so insignificant. Even if he wants to fight, he can't change the family's decision. And leaving the family, the power of the individual is actually very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Qi Qi also nodded and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond remembered the life and death battle between Richard and Xiaomensa, which was actually another model of war, so he spit out from the depths of his chest. Long sigh. He looked at Qi Qi and hesitated for a moment before he asked, "You, how are you doing now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can care, but this is really not the question you should ask." Qi Qi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Raymond reluctantly spread his hand and asked, "What is the purpose of your coming? Shouldn't it be so simple to laugh at me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is to prove to Richard that I have nothing to do with you now, that is an ordinary acquaintance. In addition, I want to ask you a question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask! I will try my best to answer." Raymond said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are constantly trying to fight against Akmon, including Gordon and Richard, even if Richard has never offended you in the past. Why?" asked Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond thought thoughtfully and said, "If you live a lion next to your home, you will be bitten by it at any time. Go, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the answer from Qi Qi, Raymond sighed and said, "Acmemond is the lion. Who? I can't predict who they will bite in the next bite. The only thing I know is that they will bite when they wake up. So, I have to find a way to give them a fatal blow when they are still asleep! Each giant is a lion relative to another giant, but some are gentle and some are violent. But the lion is a lion, and the gentle lion is extremely dangerous. So the cooperation between the giants is only temporary. In the long run, war is the only theme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Qi Qi frowned, wanted to refute, but felt Raymond’s words Some are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you want to say. The key to the problem is that even if people want to live in peace with the lion, the risk is too great. The lion’s full blow, It is possible that we will have our lives. If I start with the lion and fight with the lion, there is still the possibility of victory. On the one hand, there is a risk that cannot be borne at all, and on the other hand, it is possible to win. This is a choice that is not at all equal. If you don't know what the lion thinks, how can you choose a normal one, so I don't have to say more? So you can tell Richard that the war between the giants is inevitable. Even if he doesn't want to fight others, However, in order to prevent problems before they happen, it is still possible to start with a strong one. Especially the two sides are competing for the interests of the same field, even if they are far apart, but they will continue to meet one day. So I got it later. That is, he does not want to fight, there will be others to beat him. Let him not have to be so entangled. As an outstanding leader, he should consider who to fight with now, and how to win, not should not Question," Raymond said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 seriously wrote down and asked a few questions before saying: "You seem to be very generous, this is helping your enemy Li ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond said calmly: "For you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪看雷Meng, the clear eyes turned out to make him feel a little helpless, and turned to the beginning again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Qi Qi suddenly sighed and said: "Raymond, the biggest problem for your Solomon Scholars Master is that when you lie, there are ways to It is said to be true. This is actually what you just said, I have no ability to determine whether your words are true or false, then the best option is to believe in one sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Qi Qi will not stop, turned and walked outside the room. Raymond sat quietly there, his back straight, without a word, his eyes turned to the window, deep and distant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
