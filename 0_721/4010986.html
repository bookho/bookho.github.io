Huawen reveals a bitter smile. "How can there be such a thing in this era?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith and Age Nothing, just look at whether you can stick to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen sighed and said, "Maybe..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "Don't you take your sword away? It hurts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese snorted and put away Short sword, then lifted the chain on Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin took a look at the body and asked, "You are looking for the lost deity this time. What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it. But...you see it yourself." Hua Wen took a page from the holy book in his hand and handed it to Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin took a look, it was an old piece of paper, and there was nothing on it. But when he saw it for a long time, he saw a little darkness like ink, and then spread quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin was suddenly shocked, and when he looked closely, he could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese face looks eccentrically, and suddenly asks: "What do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A little dark, disorderly darkness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the ancient deity of light has indeed been polluted. In this case, we believe in The source will no longer exist. As I have guessed." After a meal, Hua Wen smiled and said: "You are not a saint, I can't see anything."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see it, just because my beliefs are pure and never shaken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is somewhat surprised, frowning: "How is this possible! You know The Lord of Glory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin interrupted the Chinese and said: "This has nothing to do with the Lord of Glory! My faith is not the Lord of Glory. Have you forgotten, in the preface of the Holy Scripture, what is the first sentence written?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is light?!" Huawen blurted out, then he The face suddenly changed, saying: "What do you believe in light, pure light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all right, more than light, But there is no essential difference," Martin said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can...but..." Huawen only feels dry and doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the Lord is to light the fire of the law, can be said that he is the embodiment of the rules of light. The Lord of Faith is also equivalent to the rules of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman can gain divine power and magic through faith and prayer. In essence, it is equivalent to indirectly controlling the considerable rule power through the gods. So it is much easier for the clergy to gain strength than the average strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary powerhouses are able to gradually touch and control the power of the rule after the legend. The gods of the gods are essentially equivalent to the use of regular power, so the power is much greater than the general magic and ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the legend, the clergyman will encounter bottlenecks. Their promotion depends on the size of the gods and the number of their gods. A priest who is not favored by God is not only unable to advance, but may be downgraded at any time. This is also an important reason for the true strong who are not blameless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning that Martin said is equivalent to crossing the glory of the Lord and directly to the rules of light. The meaning of this is by no means simple. This means that Martin wants to be a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is almost unbelievable that Martin will make this choice and look at him with a shocked look. There are examples of the pope in front, why is Martin going the same way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Martin smiled again and said: "Wrong, you haven't really understood what I mean. I am not trying to replace the glory of the Lord, but also not interested in Fengshen. I just believe in light, but my belief is not all light. If the Lord of Glory is still the embodiment of light. Then I will always be his most solid believer. If he is not, then I will find the incarnation of the next light. If there is no suitable person, I will become the incarnation of light. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's explanation has even shocked Chinese. He suddenly sighed and said, "Are you forcing me to make a choice? I originally thought that the timing of the showdown was a little earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Something early. When I came in, I was ready to go out." Martin also agreed. However, he turned his head and said, "But if we have to wait until we have something to do, do you think you will miss a lot of opportunities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hua Wen has no choice but to smile, saying: "Maybe! What is my current choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and said: "Give up your thoughts, take me as the main However, that is what I am waiting for from the heavens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua Wen feels that the shock tonight is a bit more: "You want to go to heaven?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin nodded and said with some faintness: "Because it is possible to find pure light, the light I believe in. And, I can’t allow those guys to Going down. I need to restore the light, use my own hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I said, when I come back, you will be the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese looks complicated, suddenly sighed and said: I think, this is where I am not as good as you. One side is a certain long life, the other side is a vain belief. In this comparison, I have been hesitating and have never been able to step out of the final step. I am better than It’s not as good as the pope.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Faith is faith, we go straight for it, we don’t have to stay for the beauty of the road.” When Martin spoke, There is already a faint light on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen slammed on one knee and said slowly: "My Lord, please allow me to add a little protection to your heavenly journey with humble faith." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and placed his hand on the top of the Chinese language and said, "By the way, I will be blessed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short ceremony is completed It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martins indulged and said, "After I left, there is one more thing that I can’t worry about. That’s Richard. I have a feeling that he will Take a thorny road. In essence, I and he will be a type of person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huawen frowned: "But the dynasty army is almost coming The Earl of Burton was led. I can only restrain the part of the church that is loyal to you and me. The restrictions on the lords are very limited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled Said: "As long as our people lose less, the lords want to be cheap, let them go! Richard's cheap is not so good. If he is not, he is not sure to take him thoroughly. Kill, then it is best not to provoke him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is arrogant. He knows very well that people like Martin and Richard are always going in extremes, and most of them will die halfway, but once they let them through the storm, they will skyrocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When are you going to Heaven?" asked Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s tonight! If you delay, I can’t guarantee that I have enough courage to do such stupid things.” Martin said with a wry smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Martin wrapped himself up in a white burqa and left the Chinese church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team is swaying in the snow and silently. Walking halfway, Martin picked up his hood and glanced at the sky. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; It was very gloomy, there were numerous feather-like snow to fall. Martin's gaze penetrated the snow, penetrated the clouds, and even penetrated the plane, and fell on Richard, who was on the other side. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Martin shook his head, which he has seen a trend of fate. In his view, Richard is marching toward the abyss of destruction, but there is no stopping idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's an idiot." Martin muttered. But he forgot, isn't he an idiot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Glory failed in heaven, and Martin decided to take over the banner of the Glorious Lord and go to heaven to complete the unfinished mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as a saint, Martin only needs to wait quietly, and he will automatically become the next glory after a period of time. Eternal and immortal. And if it fails in the Heavenly War, then Martin will lose everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Martin never felt that his choice was wrong. He is not for the god of the glory, but for that dream, the dream that has become a belief, to explore the ultimate of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Faro, Richard’s mind was another person, a great lord who was famous in the history of Noland, Bona. One of his private planes has also encountered a reaper. But the lord, regardless of dissuasion, resolutely decided to fight with the Reaper. In the end, he was defeated, and the main force of the family was completely annihilated. Therefore, the family strength was also plummeted. Later, even the title of the Duke was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lord has no regrets and leaves a paragraph before his death: "Abandonment is a rational choice. But when I see the reaper When I did what I did, I found that reason was so heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a sudden footstep outside the battle room, as well as signs of fluctuations in power. Immediately after the door of the war room was knocked, then the iron shield and others walked in, and the next few knights carried the Gangde. The two gods of the goddess of spring water are constantly giving God the magic to ease his injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is full of wounds and scars everywhere, and blood is constantly flowing in one eye, obviously already smashed. Only when the incarnation of the three goddesses comes, can he fix his eyes. But the damage to vision is also permanent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Gangde and leaned over to look at him and said, "You violated my order."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde suddenly got excited, grabbed Richard's hand and said, "Head! You must have seen what the damn guys did to my boys! They are treating us as pigs." The same slaughter! The entire Northern Army is all over, all become their raw materials! Head! Let me stay, I want to kill the guys who are the bitch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
