			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stopped the horse and looked at the half-orc warrior who was blocking the road. The longer he observes, the more detailed the information will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of eight half-orc warriors who stopped Richard. They are generally about two meters tall and have a combat level between six and eight. However, because the half-orcs are inherently stronger than the human power, they actually have the same combat power as the higher-level human warriors. However, for the team of Richard, the difference between the 7th level and the 10th level is completely different. The key is that there are two magicians in the team, and the half-orcs are poorly resistant to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc head led by the two-headed man took two steps forward, pointing to Richard’s nose and said, "Human! You killed people in the bloodstone camp. Thunder hammer adults don't like trouble! So now you have to go with me! If the thunder hammer is available, you will be questioned tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orc, if If you dare to use this position to point to a magician, then I promise that your arm will be separated from the body immediately!" Richard replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several half-orc warriors immediately showed fear and even stepped back two steps. For the Orcs, the magician is the terrible existence second only to the evil dragon. The head of the Orc leader roared angrily: "Are you a warrior who threatens the Bloodstone Horde?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his roar is fierce, pointing Richard’s hand was put down. In the legend of the Orcs, the evil and terrible magicians are almost omnipotent. For example, they can let the strongest half-orcs dying all their lives. It is a terrible punishment than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result of threatening a magician would be even worse." Richard said, even with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obviously not the case in the eyes of the Orc Warrior. He snorted and finally gave back a step and said, "But you pointed out Mark’s The house. I have to let me know what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recruited and waved, a stepping knight pulled up Mark’s head and let half The orc warrior saw his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a bloody mark!" The half-orc exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant and powerful Mark is fierce in the entire bloodstone camp, but now it is in the hands of young and handsome magicians, life and death are unknown. The magicians are really terrible metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said leisurely: "This guy lost to me in the gladiator gambling, but refused to pay. The guy who dealt with this kind of debt, I I had to work hard to collect the money myself. As for his life, it is the interest owed to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The half-orc scratched his head. I don't know how to answer it. From the perspective of maintaining order, debt collection is a legitimate act. The disputes in the bloodstone camps that are owed to the gambling debts are almost always there every day, and there are always a few lives at regular intervals. The problem is that Richard seems to be doing too much, and this kind of posture is simply like deliberately going to destroy Markman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deadlock, a small, sturdy figure ran wildly in the distance, and it was far away: "Mr. Richard! Mr. Richard! , I have something to say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the dwarf who was in charge of the arena. He was out of breath, and there were still more than ten meters away. He couldn’t wait to say: "Mark can't be irritated, Mr. Richard, you must not be impulsive... Ah! !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf is stunned because he has seen Mark's body. His gaze stayed on Mark's face for a whole minute, and he swallowed his mouth and turned to look at Richard. At this point, Richard's handsome face is in his eyes, in fact, no different from the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the dwarf and said, "The warrior of the Bloodstone tribe does not want me to go back. I remember that you promised to help me with some minor troubles." As a price that does not investigate the mismanagement of your arena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" The dwarf quickly agreed, and then ran to the half-orc leader and said A few words. It seems that the dwarf has a high status in the Bloodstone tribe. His explanation was accepted without any objection. The small leader who could lead a small team of soldiers immediately left with his own subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head slightly, and the half-beasts actually left like this? It seems that the status of this dwarf is indeed not low, and Mark does not really like it. It’s only that Richard’s magic has been used for a small while, and most of his men’s combat power has not yet been fully utilized. If the Orc warriors are tougher, he really has the heart to test the combat power of the Bloodstone tribe. However, since the half-orc wisely did not provoke Richard, Richard would no longer indulge his militant heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard laughed and laughed a little, and as he moved forward, he returned to the hotel. On the road, I don't know how many pairs of eyes are hiding in the darkness and secretly peeking at this team. But when I saw Mark's body, no one dared to have extra ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the hotel, Richard took a shot of Sam’s shoulder and said, “Good job.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to the Faro plane, Richard has become more and more like people like João and Sam. They will do a lot of other things besides leading the way. Of course, taking the lead is still their most important role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard told the man to carry the bloody body and went to the room where the necromancer Sandro lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of all the way, Sandro was very rigorous in observing the duty of a prisoner of war, without any confusion. When these times get along, Richard also found that the Necromancer is a person who attaches great importance to credibility and vows, and has a proud and persistent commitment to the Master's tradition. He defeated him by magic and he won his respect. Although the magic matchup is based on the power of the book, but in the Faro plane, all kinds of magical equipment are considered part of the power of the wizard, which means that any magic equipment can be used in the magic matchup. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tradition is also determined by the reality of the plane. In the Faro plane, the important support point for the Master's superior position is that they almost monopolize the production of all the advanced magic equipment, so in the magic showdown, of course, the importance of magic items must be highlighted, the more powerful magic can be used. The more equipped the mage, the more will be respected. After all, the magic equipment needs to be started at the same level. The magic apprentice's use of advanced implements does not exist. Therefore, the perfect combination of magic and magic equipment constitutes the mage's fighting art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Richard’s five fierce wolves who violated the common sense of magic are not as big as the pages of the book that bears the burden of Sandro. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering Sandro’s room, Richard puts Mark’s body on the ground and smiles and says, “Sandru, I’ve found it for you. A good material."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
