However, it is said that the iron triangle empire is strong, but there are many domestic giants, and there are many contradictions between them. It is difficult to coordinate. In addition to the vast territory, the control of the border areas must be very loose. And you see, this area is full of mountains and forests, sparsely populated. Most of the bases of the Bear Peter family are in this mountainous area." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "It is very possible. But it is unlikely that we will find the lighthouse that is still lit there. I doubt it, Xiong Bian The German family, like us, lost their way in the turbulence of time and space. Otherwise, they should send a higher level of construction knights instead of the town bear knight, the town bear knight should deal with 18 to 2 The sub-planet of the ten-level cap ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if the time lighthouse is ignited or not. If the base is also in the turbulent flow of time, it is better. Base. There must be a lot of time in the room, that is what I need most now. As long as I find this base, I can definitely be promoted to a tenth-level god. Once I enter the tenth level, my title ability There will be a new upgrade," said Liu Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The title? Is it a dawn? I don't know the title of the Eternal Dragon Hall and the special ability!" Richard was very surprised. He originally thought that the so-called title is just like the emperors and monarchs in history, but only used to show off and prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, the dragon of eternal and time can be less boring." Liu Sha said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned: "But some people said that it was a greedy old dragon and it was very good to lie."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, that's right! But the old dragon is really not that boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old dragon...flowing sand, I actually I doubt the degree of piety of your faith, how do you become a gods." Although he has already gone to bed, Richard has discovered that his understanding of the sand is just beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eternal and timeless dragon does not care about faith, it only cares about sacrifices." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is nothing special about the title, just that The old dragon recognizes your talents and abilities. But if the person who has the title fails to pull the sacrifice that is satisfactory enough for a certain period of time, the title will be cancelled. So Richard, you have to work hard! It’s up to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really?” Richard was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is fake!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower sand!!" Richard whispered angrily. In the intentional or unintentional induction of quicksand, the only way he vented his anger was to overwhelm the little woman. The sand will always seize every opportunity to irritate him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fierce battle, Richard lay on the blanket, and the violent respite gradually subsided. The flowing sand is curled up in his arms like a cat. It’s not just anger that Richard vented out, but also fatigue and pressure over the past few days. At this moment, Richard's body felt a burst of empty space, just like the bone marrow was pumped out, but the heart was calm and gentle, and the pressure went away, and the thoughts were widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li snorted and said: "There are more than 70 town bear knights coming over. The Bear Peter family is really bloody!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said: "This bloody, it seems that a family can afford it. No, I am not saying that Bear Peter can't get so many resources, but it doesn't make sense. Instead of destroying a potential threat in the future, it would be better to come up with this. Resources to strengthen their own strength. But if it is a couple of families, it is another matter. Every resource will not be hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it necessary to deal with me?" Li said with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is possible to eliminate a future sect, it is necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard frowned and didn't say anything. He can now be sure that as long as his magic reaches the 12th level, he can become a big builder. As for the holy constructor, if the second set of the ‘deep wildness’ series can be completed, then it is also a touch of the threshold, at least the initial road. In this way, it is really worthwhile to be yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of each plane is like a pyramid, and the top people will have the most resources. The number of positions in each layer is fixed. The status of a person is derived from comparison with other people. So if you want to move forward, either you climb up yourself or step on others. The effect is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed because he understood the truth. Although Richard wants to be strong, not to step on others. However, just like the floating island of FS, the position of each floor is fixed, so whether it is subjective or not, but indeed every step forward, one person is stepped on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a burst of fatigue, so he closed his eyes and quickly fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard led the team to continue, and found the trail left by the town bear knight in the reserved area. But he did not rush to the north, but turned to the east, dozens of kilometers in that direction, there is a supply camp set up by Jinhui Battle Flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard handed over several letters to the camp leaders to bring their caravans back to the Blue Water Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the letters was written to Ma Wen, let him try to smash the power of the temple in the Sequoia kingdom, and march into the blood-stained land to attack the alienation By. The other letters were written to the representatives of the blue water oasis and Richard, including Tiffman and Amman. The content of the letter is that Richard is in the north of the blood-stained land. Found traces of ectopic invaders, these extremely evil guys are going all the way down, it is likely to rush to the blue water oasis, so let these old friends step up to prevent losses. In the letter, Richard also detailed some characteristics of the town bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha believes that after receiving his letter, the message will be spread soon. By that time, the bears of the town will not face the scattered resistance and the hasty rush, but will be elite troops and well-trained fighters. The eyes of the strong planes will naturally be attracted by the town bear knights, ignoring the existence of such a weak intruder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Baron Fossa, as long as he does not show up for a while, after a while, people may think that Richard has become a belly of Warcraft. food. After all, in the god of courage, Richard can only get a negligible evaluation. This level of strength is not even worth the power of a great temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
