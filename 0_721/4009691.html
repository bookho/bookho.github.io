			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the sudden change of Irene, the sky of Richard’s sky is shrouded throughout the summer. A layer of haze. Whenever there is a little free time, the girl’s smiling but crying face will come to mind, no matter how deliberate it can’t be dispelled. His heart is filled with the image of Irene. With her superb wisdom and precise talent, her smile and every move will be completely restored in her mind, even every detail of her body, together with that. The most mysterious area that can be fully explored, all the bits and pieces will be clearly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood is changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, every piece of memory brought sunshine, joy, embarrassment and more expectations for the next day. Now, these memories are repeatedly superimposed one day, and finally the warmth of the warmth burns into a burning blazing, like a red iron soldering iron, burning on his immature heart, next to the deep scar , leaving a thin trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Irene has changed a lot in these days, and she knows that she has something to worry about, but she doesn’t know why, every time I ask There is no result. Until then, Richard discovered that, except for Irene, he did not have an object to speak. Yes, in the dark blue, he has no friends, no one. Although he is a pro-disciple of Su Hailun, but in the dark blue year, Richard has only seen the teacher three times. Speaking of it, in addition to the magician who taught, the time he spent with Irene was the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he is alone, the pain in Richard’s heart is exceptionally clear, and occasionally it hurts like a raging fire that only appears deep in the dream. Only when hiding in the vast world of magic and knowledge can he return to calm and focus on complex formulas, curves, magic and ectopic creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer is like winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer's Richard is amazing. In every field of study, he broke out completely, and many times the results he gave were so speechless to the well-informed Magisters. There is no other word besides the great and always correct Su Hailun, who is arrogant and wise. In a very limited time, Richard's magic growth has once again accelerated, and he will see the standard of the second-level magician in the late summer. Outside of the magic field, Richard’s performance is equally shocking. Philosophy, history, politics, economy, a small teenager like a dry desert, madly absorb every drop of knowledge. Even the most discerning big painter has been silent for a long time after seeing a painting that Richard has handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a girl’s back, carrying a large, constant-temperature food box, and walking quickly into the dimly lit passage. The silhouette of the moment, but her depression, sorrow, a little panic and fear are all outlined, even the corner of the floating magical robe, people mistakenly think that they will continue to move with the wind. I don't know why, the food box seems to be the center of the picture, and the use of the brush stroke is different from the portrait. If the dynamic shape of the portrait is perfect, the food box seems to be still there, heavy as if it is a huge stone, pull it and watch it. The heart of the painting goes straight down. The whole picture is plain, and the second type of painting is not used. It is all made up of magic feather pens. Numerous lines of dense and dense lines together make up this suffocating picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painting made the big painter look at it for an hour, but it is still difficult to give an evaluation. Finally, he suddenly sighed and said to his assistant: "Reproduction of reality as long as it breaks through the critical point, it will become art. And this painting, just the moment he caught, is enough to be eternal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
