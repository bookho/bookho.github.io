			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mensa family suddenly lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people angered Richard and even included people outside of Mensa. The young man of the Bear Peter family, Mika, was even more excited and shouted: "The noble Miss Qi Qi has been engaged to the Xiong Peter family leader! Richard, you are insulting the Xiepide family! I want Fight with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as this statement came out, there were a lot of aristocratic youths excitedly attached. Mecca is directly rushing to Richard, and it is necessary to do it on the spot. Only he just took two steps, and between him and Richard, there was a strong body of Gangde. Gangde snorted heavily and looked at the young man named McCain with a scornful look at the rabbit. Although Mecca already has fifteen levels, in the eyes of Gangde, the guy who has no bloody smell on this week is a waiter for the slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi stood quietly on the left side of Richard. Her reputation in the fauna is not small, beautiful, full of strength, and very young, which makes her name spread quickly among the nobility youth. Therefore, the angry young people have stopped wisely. They are actually very awake, knowing that they can never get a little cheaper from a 19th-level master. There was no one around, and McCain did not dare to rush to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look at the excited aristocratic youths at all, just staring at the small door Sa, faintly said: "You should know that both sides of the duel must Identity is equal, otherwise the higher-identified party can let the subordinates fight. I am the royal builder, just rely on you a guy who has no real title, but also with me to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaomensa’s face is already gloomy as to drip. What Richard said was true, but this way of speaking made him feel that he was slap in the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster suddenly raised his voice and smiled and said: "A royal builder who can't even make a third-order structure! Haha!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha finally turned his head and looked at Fengster seriously. Then he smiled and shook his head and said, "Are you so anxious to erect a big enemy for your teacher?" If I am Luno, I will definitely think about your motives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster is stunned, he looks around, but sees the faces of three emperors They are very unsightly, so they suddenly jumped in the heart. Although the Holy Alliance royal family is dissatisfied with Luno, it does not want to be a relationship between the two royal architects. For a big empire, there are not enough builders. Vonster suddenly hated his own mouth, and Richard made him look down on his eyes, but now it is Luno, not him, who really has a fundamental conflict of interest with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you refuse a duel, don't you want your brother's life?" Xiaomensa tried to make the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I will avenge him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain tone of water, Listening to the ears of Xiaomen Sa, but let his heart surge into a very strong uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not only a royal builder, but also shows the possibility of entering the holy frame in the future. A sacred architect, who wants to uproot a duke, is not a fantasy, even if the duke is a floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaomensa slightly sideways, exchanged a look with the three emperors. The three emperors nodded slightly, and Xiaomen Sa made up his mind. In fact, he is well prepared today. If the 14th-level magician does not dare to confront the 12th-level magician, it is really impossible to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaomen Sai Ran said: "Well, I promise you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi wants to say something, but still closes his mouth. She is beautiful, but that's it. The level of magic at level 8 is just a icing on the cake for her, not a key to changing her destiny. In the Mensa family, the only value she has is identity and body. The biggest role is the tool of political marriage. Compared with the acquisition of Xiong Peter, and the elimination of Richard, the enemy of life and death, her personal value of honor and disgrace is of no importance. Even Xiaomen Sa secretly thanked Richard for raising such a condition. If Richard is not in the presence of so many people, but privately proposes this condition, then Xiaomensa has already promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it is a series of matters such as a duel contract and a duel. Richard found a place to sit down and waited safely. These trivial things naturally went hand in hand, and Wen Nington was also cured by the priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall, and the injury has been controlled. He lowered his head and did not dare to touch Richard's gaze, standing with Richard on the back of Richard. He now understands that the whole thing is a conspiracy, a conspiracy to deal with Richard, he is just a bait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Richard is already preparing for a duel, or two games before and after! This gives Winnington the feeling of falling down. Richard has already demonstrated an incomparable talent. In time, Richard will be able to create a world. He can be said to support the whole person. The Kemond family. No sacred sect is a common tyrant who can be sinful. However, now he has to go to the duel because of his impulsiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to know what they are thinking and goes back and says, "Don’t think so much! Our Archimonde doesn't always rely on reason to do things." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Nyris and Agamemnon sit together and are whispering<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you think that after this return, the murderousness of Richard is a lot more heavy?" Neris whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon thought for a moment and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I still have a feeling..." Nyris hesitated, and the voice was unconsciously lower by three points, saying: "He seems to be It’s a bit like your sister.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon’s eyes were suddenly round and he looked at Richard’s back carefully before he slowly said: "This... it's best not to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I think so too. There are a few people like White Night who have already felt too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the duel continues, it is an hour later. This duel is of great importance. It is not only the grievances between the two floating islands, but also the involvement of Schumpeter and the royal family, which has sensationalized the whole of the world. All the giants sent their own representatives to watch the battle, and the Duke of Mensa and the Duke of Peter Peter were personally present. Therefore, the aristocratic officer booked the most luxurious and fully equipped duel, which can accommodate nearly a thousand people and watch dozens of boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duel, is a grand event in the aristocratic circle. It fuses honor, blood, strength and will, and it is extremely fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duel is divided into two games. The first is Frodo Mensa vs. Richard, and the second is the final battle between Xiaomensa and Richard. Between the two battles, Richard can have half an hour of recovery and rest time. The duel is a magical battle, and the site is a complex rocky terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, the Emperor of Philippe actually came to the scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his afternoon tea time, which allows the emperor to give up the meal, which is enough to illustrate the importance of these two duels in the emperor's mind. Just seeing Philip's face, everyone knows that his mood is not very good. It is no wonder that the emperor’s mood will not be very good if any royal empire is going to fight with others. This sire's means is extremely powerful, so that people who are in a bad mood will not have any good afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Philip’s arrival, the three emperors naturally went to the emperor’s box and stood on both sides watching the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cheer in the field, and Richard and F. Ordo Mensa had entered the duel. Philippe looked down at the two young men who entered the duel from both ends and suddenly snorted and said with a thick nasal voice: "This little guy at Mensa’s house is doing really well! Going up and grabbing Richard's weakness, he also made good use of the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips seems to have something to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor moved the same body as the hill, and the voice brought a sternness that was hard to detect, saying: "But Mensa is smart but not smart enough. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s assertion came out, and the three emperors suddenly thought about each other and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duel has already begun, and Frodo Mensa is a classic dress of a mage, full of magical props, not only wearing two rings, Belts, robes, boots and necklaces are all magical equipment, and most of them are sophisticated equipment, which is not a small increase for his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the duel, he showed an extremely solid magical bottom, chose the terrain, blessed the shield, waited for the counterattack, made meticulous, and the spell was clear and swift. It is a demeanor of a future big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wear any equipment, but was directly empty. After the war, Richard stood still and sneered at Frodo and blessed him with a whole set of protective magic, which slowly raised his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Frodo was preparing to attack, Richard suddenly had a hot airflow in his body, letting his short hair fly in the air. Then Richard only spit out a few short syllables, a fireball was generated between the hands, and as soon as it appeared, screamed and flew to Fodor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footo was shocked. He didn’t think that Richard’s first magic would be so fast! Did Richard leave a precious instant opportunity to fireball? Does Richard think that a three-level fireball in a district can knock down the 12-level magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wave flooded Frodo, but the magical light flashed in the fire, until the fire passed, Foodo still stood still, just looking Some wandering. Richard's fireball is so powerful that almost one of them cuts off half of his magic shield! Frodo, who was still undecided, just looked up and found that the second fireball had already left Richard's hands and roared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could it be so fast? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foodo exclaimed, and was once again flooded by fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his exclamation was immediately overwhelmed by the one-and-a-half exclamation in the duel, and the fireballs were constantly generated from the hands of Richard, whistling and shooting The location of Frodo. Richard does not need to aim at all, as long as the fireball is smashed to Foodo. His casting speed is even more incredible. Although it is only a three-level fireball, when it is shot at a speed of one second, the superimposed killing power is enough to make the Sanctuary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard took out eight fireballs, he stopped moving. And fifty meters away, Frodo has turned into a blackened body. All the magical equipment can not withstand the repeated destruction of the fire, has turned into ashes. In fact, in the sixth fireball, Frodo has become a corpse, but Richard has shot two more fireballs before they will be willing to stop. This made many of the audience in the stands feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The super-magician who served as the supervisor was also shocked, and forgot to check the life and death of Fodor. There was silence in the entire duel field, and many people couldn't help but hold their breath, playing back the incredible eight seconds in the heart. There was no shortage of well-informed aristocrats. They saw a variety of matchups and battles. They were once seen by the big magician level, but they never saw such a magic showdown. They finally saw that Richard had not planned to use other magic from the beginning, but was only prepared to use a fireball to kill Frodo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to dodge, can't resist, Richard's tactics are simple and rude, but they are arrogant from the bones! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the referee announced the result, Richard turned to look at the small door of the stands, smiling coldly, saying: "Mr. It’s your turn.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa’s face was blue and cold, and said coldly: “You are not going to hurry and recover a little magic? You can only have half It’s an hour.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the angle that people can’t see, the left hand of the small door in the sleeve can’t help but tremble. He even oozes a thin layer of sweat on his body and wets his close-fitting clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ri’s spread his hand, revealing a sunny smile, saying: “Without half an hour, five minutes is enough, because I am going to change clothes.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa was ashamed and angry, and the other side was a strange sigh of relief, so there was another layer of sweat. He was afraid that Richard would regret it and immediately said aloud: "Okay! Don't regret it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words are exported, Xiaomensa immediately feels that he is falling I have a lot of gaze on my body, and I have a lot of fire. The nobility confessed to each other and talked a lot, expressing surprise at the unexpected weakness and lack of grace of Xiaomensa. Xiaomen Sa’s heart immediately rushed into the indescribable humiliation, but then forced himself to comfort himself. As long as he won the duel, there are so many other tubes! Half an hour of rest, if you drink a special effect magic recovery agent, you can restore the magic of a six-level magic. Richard has even released eight fireballs, which consumes at least a third of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Mensa stood up immediately and shouted: "Get my gear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Several Mensa family attendants immediately stepped out, in front of countless nobles, opened a box with six pieces of equipment inside, half of which is epic equipment! Among them, the long staff is woven from two-color white gold, and the six-winged flying snake coiled around the stick is alive. When I saw this wand, someone immediately screamed: "Feathered Snake Wand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feather Snake Rod is a famous collection of the Mensa family. Staff, power more than ordinary epic wand, is close to the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Thanks to the bug-like toot, and to everyone who has been supporting you, and reminding those who want to be more than 200,000 with the moon, can The bet is ready. In the end, it is that you still owe a supplement, then this chapter is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
