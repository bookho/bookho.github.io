Replenished the establishment of the troops. The army marched forward like a long dragon. With such a large-scale march, it is impossible to win the tribe's natural hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bloody battle between the thousands of tribal warriors and the army of Richard in the nest of the nest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a bloody battle. As a possible future Indian warrior, the most not lacking for tribal fighters is courage. But war is not only the courage to win. In this battle, Richard mainly relied on the recruitment of the Shulan local warriors and tribal warriors to kill, and the elite squadron knights and followers mixed into the Shulan warriors, to kill the enemy, the meat shield live by The Lan soldiers came to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the First World War, thousands of tribal fighters all died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only eliminated twice as many enemies as themselves, the vast majority of which were the soldiers of Shulan. After being tortured and tortured by various magical and magical techniques, the tribal warriors became very fragile, and their opponents increased their combat power under the blessing of magic and magic. As a result, there was such an incredible battle. . According to the history of Hughland, thousands of tribal warriors can easily defeat the Shulan army of about 10,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribal warriors are real warriors, and even in desperate circumstances, they can die. But this way, it allowed Richard to completely destroy them, thus opening the first door to the holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately afterwards, Richard had a real war with the holy city warrior who was out of town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City warriors have about nine levels of combat power, compared with Richard’s original humanoid knight, the individual’s combat power is less, but it’s more numerous, There are several powerful state bonuses. In this battle, the holy city warriors did not only have a full number of moves, but even the strong have not retained, and the unhealed Dragon Star has once again appeared on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is particularly hard. Although he has the strongest of the three Gordon eras of Senma, Asiris and Lina, and Fasqi, who is not weaker than the three knights, the role of the three gods of Liusha, Io, and Naiyou is inexplicably weaken. On the Shenchao Mountain, the power they consume is hardly replenished. And the holy city warriors are well equipped and not much worse than the Richards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only advantage of Richard is the construction of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a rigorous lineup, slowly approaching the holy city warrior, Richard first ordered the Shulan soldiers to attack. In the presence of the holy city warrior, the will of the Shulan warriors was greatly affected. After all, the knife to the holy city warrior was equivalent to cutting into what he thought was the most sacred since childhood. However, the holy city warriors will never pity these ordinary Shulan warriors, counterattacking the fierce and fierce, just killing the first thousand men sent out by Richard at the expense of dozens of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quiet and sent a team of thousands. This time, with the lessons of the past, the Shulan warriors fought bravely. After all, for ordinary people like them, life is often more important than faith. The holy city warrior's fighting will is as cold and ruthless as the elite squadron, and in the blink of an eye, the second thousand team was killed. But this time they paid dozens of lives at the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the strong men on both sides have been together, and Richard placed fifty of the knights in the center of the battlefield and stood still. If the strong side of Richard's side is unfavorable, he can retreat into the scope of the construction of the Knight throwing a spear. Don't say that Shulan's sanctuary is strong, that is, Dragon Star does not dare to easily enter the fire circle of the knight. On the frontal battlefield, Richard sent 3,000 people to meet the holy city warriors in one breath, and sent 3,000 people to the rear of the holy city warriors in the left and right wings. After a while, all the holy city warriors will finally be Surrounded by killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy city warriors are not flustered, they are never afraid to win less, and the belief in fanaticism in the bones makes them fearless. The holy city warrior formed in a dense formation is like a thorny steel ball, letting the Shulan warriors bite and not move, but stab the blood of the Shulan soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha raised the destiny of Gemini far away, and a series of lightning bolts shot into the queue of the holy city warriors. This kind of dense formation is most suitable for the power of serial lightning, and the electric fire has jumped dozens of talents to disappear. However, the power of the chain of lightning after the fate of the twins and the mana penetration was far lower than expected. Only the first two holy city warriors fell, and the holy city warriors just shook and slammed into life and death. . The magical resistance of the holy city warrior is beyond the height of Richard's surprise, and on the mountain of the nest, the power of magic and magic is extremely limited, less than 70% of the weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy city warrior is a white helmet silver armor, just like a polished steel ball. Their hardness is also comparable to that of stainless steel, which makes their teeth bloody. But there was a way for Richard to break them, so he reached a series of orders in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long horn sounded, and the two teams of half-residual Shulan fighters were still unknown, but instinctively followed the instructions of the horn and the flag. Before the formation of the holy city warrior surrounded by the group, a wide passage suddenly appeared! This is enough for five or six knights to ride the assault channel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel commander appeared, the commander of the holy city warrior immediately shrank and shouted. Instead of organizing troops to escape along this passage, they turned over the most powerful warriors and blocked the passage. He himself stood in the middle of the passage and clenched the round shield and the stab gun in his hand. Sure enough, at the other end of the passage, there was a shadow of the knight, watching the powerful momentum and sophisticated to the dazzling equipment, you know that it is the ultimate arm of the Noland, the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the knight mounted the mask, clenched his hand in the gun, and stared coldly at the holy city warriors. Even he has to admit that it is a very difficult enemy. As the first row of assault knights, he has a great chance of dying. But the more dangerous the task, the more the leader, the more rushing to the top. This is the tradition of Archimonde, which was carried forward to the extreme in the hands of Gotton, and is now inherited by Richard. Therefore, as a man of Archimonde, as a man with a high reputation among the free Archimonde warriors, he is even less likely to retreat at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his left hand and gently touched the breastplate, even though he could feel it through the armor, the plate breastplate and the lining of the magic light chain. That place is getting hot. There is a close-fitting pocket where a sketch of the ink pen is placed. It was painted by his former comrades, although the brushwork was rather rough, but very vivid. It was a pair of plain-looking middle-aged men and women and three children of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family that looks ordinary and happy is enviable. That is his family, the source of his fighting power. Now, his two sons will say that their father is a knight. And when they grow up, they imagine that their father became a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man sighed in his heart. After this war, perhaps he would also become a war dead. At that time, his children mentioned his father many years later. When you use it, it will be a proud and sad tone. But in any case, the children will be proud of his name, Brolin. And now it's different from the past. Before the most dangerous battles, Brolin always thought of family and children, and they would think about what kind of situation they would be after they died. Because the freedom of Archimonde's career is actually equivalent to a mercenary, but the danger is rewarding. But now, Brolin knows that once he is killed, the person behind him who takes over the Gordon position will take good care of his family and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
