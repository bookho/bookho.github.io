			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to the camp, he did not fall asleep, but repeatedly thought about it. In the current situation, this news highlights it. He has no rush to get on the road with much preparation. Now he is doing the right thing. Calando is a mysterious and isolated world. If you want to go deep into Calando to save people, especially It is still the mountains and the sea that are attracting attention. No amount of preparations are enough. Can he really lead the army to kill Calando? Even the expeditionary army of the Millennium Empire has lost its sand, not to mention his patriarch of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the preparations are complete, the holy scriptures here have already settled, and what more preparations are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Richard felt that only by participating in the Holy Scriptures and defeating all opponents in front, there was a chance to live. At that time, the gambling was that the people in the temple would still have barbarians. At least the rules and shame, not to openly tear the rules of the holy code, this expectation is very embarrassing, this kind of thing, perhaps seen in many barbarian warriors, can also be seen in the real king, but certainly not Found in these high-ranking elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only by winning the entire Holy Scriptures, after talking about it, Richard closed his eyes, and his heart was calm, let the body adjust to the point The best state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, there are three more tests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard went out, he suddenly felt a few eyes falling on his body. He turned his head and saw several high-ranking samurai costumes dressed in the holy temple. The people are surrounded by a tall and thin old man. Looking at this side, Richard just glanced at them and he didn’t care. He waited quietly for his next opponent. Anyway, he wanted to fight all the opponents. Sooner or later, it will cause concern, but it is no big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A samurai high-ranking warrior pointed to Richard and said: "The elders, that is, the person recommended by Cangyang Zhuoma, yesterday was a knockdown. Opponents, very promising."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see it first." The elder said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in today’s battle is obviously much more intense than the previous day. Many of the games were only a half-day battle, and only the winners were as simple as yesterday’s. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three opponents played one by one, all of which were stepped down by Richard. No matter what weapons they used and what kind of combat skills they used, even one who had specially smashed a huge tower shield was no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the three trials, Richard went to his camp, prepared to rest, and looked at the back of Richard, the eye of the elder of the temple was in the slightest The beating, several senior samurai temples all held their breath subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A senior holy temple warrior suddenly made a long breath and said: "This person is really recommended by Cangyang Zhuoma. I don't see much worse than her." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder snorted and said slowly: "Cangyang Zhuoma is not his opponent. This person is at least better than her." Much more, what is his name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior responsible for hosting the contest was called over. He checked the information and said: "Elders, this is On the 1908th, the name is Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha...Licha." The voice of the elders rose slightly and his face changed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder, what's wrong." Next to the holy temple senior warrior hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder's face immediately recovered as usual, saying: "Nothing, let him continue to try, you go and talk to Richard, let him not take too heavy hands Other people, you also greet me, don't go to provoke Richard, let's go, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders left in the crowd of senior warriors, The only warrior who left a misty water, he knew that Richard was very powerful, but he couldn’t see where it was, but since the elders told him, it means that Richard is indeed extraordinary and must be treated with care. In the words of Noland, you have to take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this night, Richard’s rest was very stable, and no one had ever been in the knife in front of Gesang’s account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in the camp, Richard stretched out his index finger and wrote something in the air. His fingertips lit a little red and left a long time in the air. The trajectory does not scatter, and Li writes as he likes, but the lines are as thick as one. There is no change in the slightest. Life has reached this point, and finally there is a realm of white night, but the realm is the same, but every life is absolutely They are all made by Richard himself, and they are very familiar with the internal structure. There is also a perfect life that combines the real name of destruction. If the real killing power, the Richard at the moment is already above the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors of the tribe came one after another, and some people joined the holy scriptures. They were constantly inserted into the queue of the contest. This is the style of Calando. The basic order is maintained in chaos. Richard does not care if his opponent is daily. The three people are still five people. Anyway, no matter how many people come up, they are all stumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the stage of the pre-war, the sacred fighting technique is slightly exposed, which is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the eight people selected in the pre-war will be together with the sixteen people recommended by the Presbyterians and the eight people selected by the Holy Temple. Gilalama had two or two battles until the last one was decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the Gikrama Peak, the mountain and the sea are sitting on a rock, holding their hands and watching the snowy mountains under the night, she knows, in her Invisible, Richard is already there. Behind her, Uzzara's great sacrifices appear quietly. The great sacrifice tonight looks extraordinarily old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Today, Richard played six games and was a one-shot victory." The big sacrifice said with a smile, he could see that he wanted to make the mountains and the sea happy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the mountains and the sea. After a while, I faintly asked: "The big sacrifice, is this the decision of the beast god?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzzazu was shocked, the two long eyebrows were almost twisted together, and before he said anything, the mountain and the sea asked again: "Or, the beast "Know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, of course..." The big sacrifice suddenly stopped talking. In the face of the innocent and pure girl, he could have done anything. They are all pretty, but now they really can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was overnight that she suddenly grew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you know that?" Uzzarazu asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you told me about this, I knew that you might have a hundred ways to explain the god of the beast, but I know Some things it likes, some things it doesn't like, this thing, the beast will certainly not like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl's words let Uzzarazu grow his eyebrows It’s moving again. Sometimes the reason is so simple. It’s useless to paint a sophistry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, you...you should change your clothes and take a shower." In this sentence, Uzzarazu said it was very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea did not move, but said: "You want to wash away my saint totem, so as not to end the holy test, a stick What kind of prince is dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkles on Uzrazu’s face are getting deeper and deeper, and his head is gradually sag, sighing: "His Royal Highness, You understand it, and even if you don't want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't want to, Richard can't live back to Noland, is it?" "The mountain and the sea asked straight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice coughed up and said, "There is an accident in the Holy Scriptures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea ask again: "My mother, she knows about it too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the decision of the Holy Temple and the Snow Mountain Presbyterian Church. As an elder, she naturally knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea, no longer say anything, no anger or loss of expression, just calmly Sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice does not know what to say, silence for a moment, then said: "His Royal Highness, you have grown up."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have grown up, I just didn’t want to think so much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice suddenly sighed and said: Your Highness, you really shouldn’t call Richard. He came, and you have no room to refuse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea suddenly chuckled and said "That's not necessarily, I told him to come, I want to show some people to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is." Uzzazu is very Strange, he really didn't know who the mountain and the sea could help at this time, and the entire Snow Mountain Presbyterian Church had reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if I say it now, it's my useless father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Goshawk, it is him, he has been in Calando for twenty years..." Uzzarazu is also unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
