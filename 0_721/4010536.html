			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the integration of the book of the book, the discovery of the book The page function has not changed. The only extra function is to let Richard know that there are still two residual pages not collected, and the original book of creation has one more page. Now it is two, this creation and The book of bearer erases a page of holy content and floats a new piece of content. From here, Richard knows the true usage of the book of creation. He can input the power of different nature into the pages of the book, thus condensing into a new summoning creature. Usually, the summoning creature lives in a certain form in the independent world formed by the pages of the book. In the battle, it can appear according to the call of Richard. As the nature of Richard's input power is different, the summoned creatures created will be different. As the strength of Richard grows, the summoning creature will become stronger and stronger. The current limit of the creature that can be condensed is 16th. If Richard forces the input of the book to exceed the upper limit, it can also break the upper limit of power, or Summon more Was just this way, most of the power of the input Richard wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard understands why Martin summons so many sacred creatures, that is not the power of Martin alone, but over the years The presence of the powerful forces of the Church of St. Hui continued to infuse the power, but was squandered by Martin for a ridiculous reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha thought for a moment, once again mobilizing the power of the real name Saron, in the book of creation condensed two elf prophets, they all have the ability of seventeen And equivalent to equipped with a good level of equipment, the ability of the Elf prophet is between the Master and the priest, has a lot of ability to assist the battle, the role on the battlefield is very important, with two elf prophets, can make two hundred The rider's combat power is upgraded to a whole level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed this new book on creation and bearing, Richard feels that its only shortcoming is that it is too bulky and heavy, and Richard now has Three swords, a fateful twin, is it necessary to hang a book in the waist again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, as long as it can increase combat effectiveness, Richard is not afraid of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of things to do next, but Richard’s time is not enough. He stood in front of the magic map of the study room and stood still. The magic map is divided into several parts. The center is naturally Noland and Calando, and the surrounding is a map of each private plane. The largest and most detailed nature is Faro, followed by Green Forest and Hulan. And the planes guarded by Achilles and Haner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time of meditation, Li finally decided to open up the green forest first. On the one hand, it is the time when the tree of life should be approaching the Jin Dynasty. The promotion of the life tree is very important to Richard. It is the best time to analyze the rules of life. On the one hand, Richard feels that his strength is enough to repel the natural enemies of the tree of life in the promotion of the ranks, even if the natural enemies will be several times the normal number under the instigation of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan has been set, and Richard will leave the study and order all the troops to assemble and prepare for remote transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, most of the followers returned to the Faro plane, this time they had only one mission, to open up the territory, the twilight, the splash and the ogre The mountains and the sea will go to the green forest with Licha, while the four emperors and Agamemnon will also mobilize the elite to enter the green forest, and the three people are ready to push the green forest situation forward a big step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to Greenson, Richard first returned to Faust, and before he returned to the plane, he still had an important thing to do. Install the conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convening of the conference will first need to be approved by the royal family, so the first thing Richard is to visit the Royal Masters Association, register the installation conference, the royal mage The association occupies a large-scale temple in the floating world, and this alone can highlight their transcendental status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard set foot on the steps of the Masters Association, the two great magisters were already waiting at the door. They recognized Richard for the first time and quickly greeted Come up, respectfully said: "Master Richard, Lord Thor is already waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha glimpsed, said: "A piece of construction It’s just a press conference, you don’t need to be alarmed by the president.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left big magister smiled and said: “The exhibition of Master Richard’s decoration, but very Desirable, His Royal Highness will hope to provide the best service, so as not to be worthy of your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, let Throw's Highness "And said, Richard went with the two great magisters to the top of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registering the Royal Conference to the Royal Masters Association is not just a form, but a substantial benefit. After registration, Richard is only ready to publish. Loading, without having to deal with other trivial matters, all the Masters Association will do a good job for Richard, and even send invitations. Richard is still young, and there are not many strong people, but the Royal Masters Association is different. This behemoth has a complex network of contacts, which guarantees that every strong person who is eligible to participate in the conference can receive an invitation letter. They will also determine the scope of the invitation according to the content of the conference, such as Luno’s There were very few legendary powerhouses at the press conference, and there were many agents of legendary powerhouses in Richard’s second suit auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard quietly followed the two great mages to walk upstairs, because the headquarters of the association does not allow any form of transfer of magic, from the attitude of the Masters Association to treat themselves, Richard feels his recent series of progress may They are all seen by the Masters Association. Otherwise, they are just an ordinary big magician. The official members of the Royal Masters Association must be the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Richard has entered Thor’s office. At the moment of entering the gate, Richard even imagines that he has entered the world of the elves. The grassland, the dense forest, all kinds of flowers, fruit trees and exotic plants make up a fairytale world. A small river flows through the woods and injects into a small lake that is as smooth as a mirror. With umbrellas, tables and chairs, several Elf waiters are busy shuttles, placing fresh fruit and fine wine on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chunky and bald old man standing in the seat, with a big red nose, and stretched out his arms to Richard, saying: "Hey, Richard, welcome to my world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that this unseen old man is Thor, but he doesn’t dare to look down at all. This funny guy, Tol’s name has a series of titles and identities. In addition to the president of the Royal Masters Association, he is still the uncle of the current Emperor Philip, with pure royal blood. In this era, the royal family. The lineage is not only representative of noble status, it is also synonymous with powerful blood, the Thunder Destroyer belongs to the blood from the ancient Titan, a whole higher than the ancient giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man is not only a legendary mage, but also a legendary mage who is known for his thunder spells. He has a bloody bonus. Thor is definitely a A fearful existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard greeted Thor, not eager to say hello, but looked carefully at the surrounding environment, and Thor’s office occupied half of the top floor. The other half is divided by two other legendary mages, but Richard looks at it and sees the forest is boundless, estimated to have at least a few square kilometers, far exceeding the area of ​​the top floor. Even more than Su Hailun’s private level on the dark blue, and Richard saw a rolling sun on his head, but he took a closer look, and insights cracked the illusion of the whole world, the high blue sky. The white clouds disappeared completely, revealing a deep void. You can see a layer of magic light curtains covering the whole earth. The sun is actually a huge fireball that ignites and burns in a hundred meters of high air. Throughout the forest, seeing the arc of the magic shield, Richard estimated that this is a huge land of about 20 square kilometers, but most of it floats in the void, only one corner through the plane barrier, on the promise Rand Surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
