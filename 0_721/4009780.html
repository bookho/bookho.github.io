			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s official scepter’s scepter has disappeared in place and turned Appeared around Gotton, smiling and said: "The Marquis of Gordon, I did not expect that you have prepared such a high-level sacrifice this time, so that the gods I receive will also increase a lot. But this level of sacrifice The sacrifice of this child, although he will definitely become a big builder in the future, seems to be a little waste... I heard that Archimonde has a lot of enemies in FS, and it is very powerful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon took a deep breath and said, "This is what he deserves, and he will soon send him to other planes, and he will be able to add a little god. Just add a little more! As for the enemy, hehe, they want to come, all dare to come, I will let them regret!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican Nodding, elegant and calmly said: "Look at the child's god, hope to have the gift of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light column, Shares unspeakable huge awareness has rolled down Richard. The mind of Richard was suddenly pulled back from nothingness, and suddenly he found himself turned into an ordinary person. All the magic power could not be used, and even the blood ability was completely blocked. After a sudden, Richard immediately reacted, and the sacrifice ceremony officially began. He quickly picked up the head of the devil from the big box and pushed it hard on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil’s head just touched the altar, and the altar immediately burst into a strong radiance, and a beam of light rose from the sky. Under the light, the devil’s head gradually changed. It was transparent, and then numerous small gods flew out of the head, gathered to the endless void, and then disappeared. For a time, the altar was like a fireworks, and countless gods, such as only golden butterflies, fluttered to the stars in the distance. The devil's head is gradually annihilated until it disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beam of light appeared in the void, straight in front of Richard, turned into a light, and then you can see that countless scene symbols are constantly changing inside. . Richard was slightly relieved, and the appearance of the light meant that the sacrifice had satisfied the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, at least not in the case of God's punishment. But I don't have to worry too much. Generally speaking, only the head of a big devil is enough to complete the highest level ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is difficult to capture stable images when the light changes, Richard still tries hard to look at the light and shadow in front of him. The images that are still on the ground are obtained, and the understandings seen by the eyes are much deeper, and the touch on the rules of the world will go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each scene, each symbol represents a specific kind of grace. For example, weapon armor means that you may get powerful equipment. Crystal gems are rare resources. Various gods are powerful gods. The duration is determined by the degree of god. The most precious thing is the symbol of the eternal dragon temple: the hourglass. Any gift related to the time flow rate is extremely powerful. From the perspective of magical mathematics, grace is random and there is no law to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light slammed open and condensed into a huge hourglass on top of Richard! His breath didn't stop, and his heart rushed. The golden sand in the hourglass is flowing silently, that is, the visualization of the time flow rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge consciousness once again shrouded Richard, and the first stage of the sacrifice ended. He quickly pressed the joy of his heart, and then effortlessly moved the devil's heart to the altar. After all the abilities have been blocked, it is not easy to move the one-kilogram guy. If Richard is not fed a strong body in the dark blue, he will not be able to drag the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Richard looked at the altar with full expectation. The offerings of Eternal and Time Dragon are all powerful things. They can be artifact fragments or whole rare ore. Compared with the production of Noland, the production from the ectopic surface will always get more. God, and the greater the power of the offering, the more the gods will be obtained. Therefore, in terms of strength level, the heart of the demon lord is a more precious sacrifice than the head of the big devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the heart was placed on the altar, the altar trembled a bit, then silenced, and Richard could not help but hold his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low husky dragon on the altar, and the golden light that could not be seen directly from every minute of the altar, gathered into dozens of The golden rapids impact the devil's heart from all angles. The devil's heart violently twitched, and it made a very screaming scream, and then it was pushed into the air by the golden torrent. More golden light flows from the altar and from the void, impacting the devil's heart from all angles, you can see that the edge of the heart is gradually transparent, and gradually the pale gold gods are separated and risen into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these gods have a glimpse of the golden thread connecting with the heart, and the speed of the heart pulsation is only ten times faster. Every pulsation will be discrete. The gods pull back some. However, as the light flowed away, more and more gods were separated from the heart, and the lines of the gods began to break, so the golden butterfly began to appear in the air, fluttering its wings to the end of the void. Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar decomposes the devil's heart much more slowly than the devil's head. After ten minutes, the devil's heart in the air still has a small half. And the sky has begun to have a light column that represents God's gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no change in the light of this time, and it directly condensed a time hourglass. The light column does not mean to stop, and it continues to converge into a very shining light. The light is getting stronger and stronger. Unlike the previous light, there is no sign of change, and the volume has not expanded significantly. It is only increasing the intensity and brightness. . Richard looked at him for a while and had to look away. His eyes were completely out of sight. And more of the beam of light is still appearing in the void, and then into the increasingly bright ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's heart is finally completely annihilated, and two time hourglasses float above the altar, and the glare of the glare has completely converged, revealing a purely golden The light ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the picture, the light ball without any characteristics is a rare gift of God, it is possible to open anything, perhaps an extremely powerful artifact, also It may be a lot of resources, although it is worthwhile, but it doesn't necessarily have much to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a strange, grand and unsounding voice sounded in the consciousness of Richard: "People, you must give grace to yourself and the family territory." Is there a distribution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard remembered Gordon’s jealousy, but what happened on the road to the sacrifice came to his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon and his knights are shaking their enemies in the dark with their extraordinary strength and courage. Perhaps Archimonde's enemies can destroy this team, provided that they pay a painful price, and at least the strongest ones who rushed up must be accompanied by the funeral. However, the alliance of the ghosts is nothing but a loose sand. The five fingers that can't make a fist can't make a fatal blow. Although the stalkers can't wait for Archimonde to die immediately, no matter who is strong or the family behind them, no one wants to. It is you who pay the price, and are even less willing to use their own sacrifices to achieve the brilliance of others. If the Knights of Archimonde at the time showed even a little bit of fear, the wolves in the dark would embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
