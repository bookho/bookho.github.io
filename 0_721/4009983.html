			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magic suddenly vented, the feeling of collapse Falling down, but he did not forget that this is a battlefield that counts every second. He stretched out his hand and grabbed the arm of the poet who jumped up and helped himself. He stood firm and then issued a series of orders in his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦啦 rupture, the rest of the truck’s car panel was broken and cut by a sharp axe, a group of throwing soldiers jumped out of the van, backhand Take out a throwing axe in the carriage and throw it! The battlefield was immediately filled with sharp whistling, and a handle-handed axe flew to the cavalry still in chaos. In the range of 50 meters, the power of the axe is unusually large. The Knight's armor does not play any protective role. As long as it is thrown by the axe, whether it is a man or a horse, it is immediately broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throwing axe is incredibly fast, the will of their battle will not be moved by any foreign objects, nor the magical gods that have been shown for the previous Richards. The technique was shocking, and all the throwing axe was thrown the first time after receiving the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of throwing soldiers at the best distance, in the shortest time, throwing five waves of axe, that is like a rain like a bombardment, only as a front Only then will you know the horror. The language can't describe the feeling of hundreds of flying axe flying overhead. Just after five rounds of axe, the cavalry that can stand still has less than fifty rides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open mouth of the Cavaliers leader finally closed, yelling and letting all the cavalry retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Want to run?” Li’s mouth sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sandman cavalry has long been wrestling with two wings, and the throwing soldiers have not thrown axe, and they have picked up the armor and found the bones with pale white color. blade. However, under the constraints of the elite throwing soldiers, there is not one throwing soldier, but arranged in three rows of horizontal rows, slowly pushing. Before the throwing of the soldiers, there was no re-installation of infantry guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader went through a hundred battles and immediately saw the weakness of Richard’s war, and looked at the team that the striker had entangled, and knew that he wanted to It’s too late to escape. The Shamin cavalry has special endurance and toughness. It is unlikely that they will escape from their pursuit. It is better to simply throw the array of soldiers and throw them into the array. Maybe they can break through the array and catch Richard directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just ordered to prepare for the battle, but found that before the throwing of the array of soldiers, a strong figure stood up and stood across! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hundreds of throwing soldiers, there were no formations of infantry, only Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the face of just one opponent, the Cavaliers leader is hesitant to be rare, that is, a slight hesitation, let him lose the last opportunity. The cavalry who failed to get back and forth did not receive follow-up orders, some of them rushed forward, some retreated, and some had collided with the flanked Shamin Knights, but more of the Shamin cavalry had almost completed the parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly raised his right hand and made a fist, everything was exactly the same as the one just got the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sandman cavalry screamed at the battle number and slashed with the cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the melee, the aggression of the elf wars sounded, and the battle of the Shamin Knights went up one level. One by one, the cavalry fell to the horse, letting the Cavaliers lead the way, but the defeat was irreparable. After these elite knights witnessed Richard's magical storm, their fighting spirits have been completely weakened to the lowest point. Faced with the skills that are not inferior, the hot but still rivals, they are immediately at a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet sighs the battle song while naming the knights with long bows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the desperate situation, the knight leader, such as the injured lion, screams amazing power, and the blood-stained sword in the hand has three sands in one face. The knight was fallen. But in his vision, there are more knights who have been degraded. Instead of those throwing soldiers, such as cave dwellings, the Shaman cavalry alone can now kill one with two or even three. The Cavaliers leader already knows that he will not be able to leave alive today. He can see the determination of the other side to kill from the performance of Richard before and after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he did not ask what was on the car before the 'robbery', Richard did not care about the identity of these people and the behind-the-scenes ambassador. . Everything has always been an open secret, but the superiors are pretending to be ignorant. This is the game rule of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy gaze of the knight’s leader has been eyeing the next sandman’s cavalry, but at this moment, a chilly wind floats from behind his back, 拂Got on his neck. Then the skin on the side that was blown by the wind was immediately densely covered with a small plaque. The leader of the knight shouted, and the whole man rushed directly to the ground, even the horses were ignored! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even during the day, the faint sleep guide is unremarkable, but its power is beyond doubt. The blade suddenly appeared, rubbing the neck of the knight's leader and passing a deep horrible wound on his neck and shoulder. However, this knife was heavy, but it failed to fly directly to the head of the Cavaliers as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl reacted very quickly, and the blade went down at the turn, but it only cut open the carapace of the knight’s leader, and added more on his back. A long wound, still failed to kill him on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The knight's leader fell heavily on the ground, then rolled a few times in a row, and immediately flashed a few meters away, temporarily pulling away from the girl. He supported his hands and stood up, and he looked back. Until then, he saw the girl who was standing on the back of her horse. Is this wild girl with a thin face, almost wants her own life? The knight leader was wondering. However, his back suddenly became a little cold, and his chest immediately highlighted a blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers’ head squeaked in the throat, but could not say a complete sentence. He looked down and looked at the short blade, then desperately wanted to look back and see what it was like to kill himself. But the head only turned to half, the feeling of numbness spread throughout the body, and the darkness infected all of his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end, the Cavaliers did not see the twilight look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last cavalry fell, the short and tragic killing was finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seized the sand at the first time and asked: "The magical technique just now is the result of your latest research? What is it called? How have I never listened?" Have you said a similar magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God's boiling"! It is equivalent to a six-level magic that can greatly increase the speed of the magician's mana. And speed up the time flow of the magician body. How, feel good?" Flowing sand proudly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just crazy!" Until then, the feeling of being in the same place as the gods still shocked Richard. A whole cavalry squadron was smouldering in the palm of the hand. This kind of power, this kind of destruction, this kind of manipulation, was never dreamed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
