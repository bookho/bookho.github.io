			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This nameplate allows Lina to go to the third floor of the firm, and The top-level equipment showroom on the fourth floor and the small auction halls on the fifth and sixth floors cannot go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two floors are some materials and sophisticated equipment, the third layer will appear all kinds of rare fine-level equipment, there will also be epic equipment Lina entered the hall and walked directly to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, just a group of people are coming downstairs. The head is a handsome young man in his twenties. Founder’s face is a long-term high. The momentum, he saw Lina, first eyes bright, then revealed a doubtful expression, and finally lost the voice: "Lina."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina looked up, then With a smile, he politely said, "The Count of Cardiff, I am so good, I saw you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Count of Cardiff belongs to the Tucson family. It belongs to the sixth floor of the floating island giants, and he looks at Lina at this moment, his eyes are shining, praiselessly praised: "Lina, you are really more and more beautiful now, especially this The sub-mask is entirely a work of art. If I am not mistaken, the above pattern is not only a decorative effect, but also a magical array with a special function. It is not inferior to the art of handcrafting and design. A masterpiece at the level of the builder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The praise of the class was indifferent, but today the Earl of Cardiff made Lina feel extra happy, her smile became sincere, and nodded slightly, paying tribute to Count Cardiff, saying, "Thank you for your compliment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s eyes brightened and he looked more diligent and stunned. He said, “It’s great to be able to see you again here. What can I do? Is it for you, it doesn't matter, even though it is told."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I just arbitrarily turn around and see if there is something for you, don't bother you. Lina refused. Although she had seen one of the Tucson family's real powers on many occasions, there was no friendship between the two families. So today, she is only the third time with Count of Cardiff. Speak alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif refused to give up, repeatedly expressed his intention to serve, and Lina finally felt that the attitude of Count Cardiff seemed to be too diligent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can go to the fourth floor to talk, there must be something you need." The light in the eyes of Count Cardiff is getting more and more blazing, and he reaches for Lina's arm. Although this move is a bit reckless, it is undeniable. His manners are still full of the elegance of the family, not too cumbersome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina was a cold face, stepped back, let the Count of Cardiff open, said coldly: "The Earl, please pay attention to yourself, I just have to pick something on the third floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddoff raised his eyebrows and took back his hand and smiled and said: "Lina, now song You obviously can't come back. You are a big magician, but in my eyes, I think you are a beautiful and charming woman. I am dumping for you, so I officially issued an invitation here, Lina, join. Tucson family, I like you, I need you more, help me get the location of the Duke of Tucson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Gadifton paused, staring at Lina "I was the Duchess, this is a promise, a public commitment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina frowned and went back again One step, pull away the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddoff stood still, no longer chasing it, just staring at her with fiery eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s heart is slightly touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Gordon’s disappointment with Qi Qi’s face, she has been suffering and confused for quite some time, and she is at a loss, as if she is more than ten The track of the year of life also disappeared together. All her life, only the thing that keeps the Greenson plane for Gotton, whether he can still come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the relationship between the 13th Cavaliers and Gordon is more loose than that of outsiders. They are more like a group of partners who start a career together, not a leader. With his subordinates, Gordon did not have many rules to constrain them. More is to gather them around themselves by personal charm. From this point of view, Lina does not owe anything to her, even a promise is not owed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s thoughts are involuntarily transferred to Richard and used him as a control. This boy is completely different from his father, Richard and followers. Their relationship is much closer. There is not only the master-slave constraint of the magic contract. From these days, in the experience of Faro, Richard is the absolute leader and leader, and he has arranged the followers from the construction to the equipment. Everything, in this case, the followers are more closely connected with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing happened, then in a few years, Lina defended Greenson and handed over the plane to Richard, and Cardiff’s proposal might really make her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a woman, the Duchess is mostly happy than the lonely Magister, and Cardiff, who earned the title of Earl in his twenties, has no doubt about his personal ability. The reputation of private life is actually good, it is a very rare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Lina has a mask on her face, and a gentle touch that can be applied to her skin. She wants to confirm what it is, Involuntarily raised his hand and gently touched the cheek of the lower mask with his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she said softly: "Sorry, I don't want to leave Archimonde." When it came to the last few syllables, Lina's voice became very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Earl of Cardiff became more and more violent as Lina raised her hand and touched the mask. The big magician had the charm of a mature woman like a flame, but In the moment, there was a confused look like a young girl, and the huge contrast was full of unspeakable temptations, which made him involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lina’s answer was like a bowl of ice water, and Cardiff’s face immediately became very ugly, and he was unwilling to block his chest. He almost It is screaming: "Why, the Tucson family can't compare with Archimonde. Isn't it enough to be sincere? From the first sight of you, I liked you, and now Gordon is fundamental. Can't come back, the five knights he left, except you, are in a de facto independent state, why do you want to sell your life for Archimonde, and what they can give you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Archimonde can give her is the one on the chest, or the 200,000 gold coins in her hand, none of them, with Lina’s special talent And the more powerful the combat force in the later stage, it is a matter of time to get more fourth-order construction. As for the 200,000 gold coins, although it is a huge sum of money, it is only a huge sum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s thoughts are a bit erratic at this moment, and many past events that are no longer reminiscent of the moment are unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the girlhood, Gordon took her to the east to discuss, experienced countless winds and blood, and also seen many mainland planes, is a song Dunton, unfolding a vast and vast world in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gotton left, Richard returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw Richard, I still took the young boy’s youth, and then I had a more obvious change than once, like Gotton, I can always He saw the birth of a miracle in his hand, but Richard and Gordon were different, more delicate than Gotton, and more able to experience and capture the minds of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linna remembers that the earrings and masks are now on her face, earrings, so Archimonde gave her, Not a gold coin or equipment, but a growing experience and two small gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lina smiled and did not answer, Count Cardiff’s face was even more ugly. He knew his responsibilities and goals from his childhood, and he also deliberately disciplined himself. Even claiming to be self-sufficient, but he is still young after all. In the past, he gained enough reputation and praise in social situations and spoiled him. He could not accept his sincerity and would be rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, people around Cardiff started to help: "Akmund is notoriously poor, Lina, a big magician like you. Need to sell equipment, it is necessary to mix with the group of poor people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lina, you still don't know, last time you The reason why the two pieces of equipment can sell high prices is actually the purchase of the Earl of the Lord in private. Otherwise, it is possible to value the price based on the goods from the two low-level planes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina bowed and looked up at Cardiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif looked very seriously at Lina and said, "Lina, please believe in my sincerity, I invite you to fight with me, not Keeping you in the back garden, we will jointly take the position of the family heirs and win the title together. Everything on the floating island and even the family territory will be mine and yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Cardiff’s proposal is actually quite tempting and impactful, but he appears in a very wrong time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina sighed and shook her head again, then took a step back and wanted to turn and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next person around Cardiff is not doing it, a middle-aged aristocrat with a full-fledged costume sneer and said: "Lina, you can It’s not smart enough, what good is it with Archimonde, even an epic level of equipment can’t afford it, if I’m not guessing wrong, what kind of equipment do you want to sell, an epic gear, at least It takes 100,000 gold coins to get it, and I heard that Archimonde went out, it is generally difficult to exceed one thousand gold coins, hahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
