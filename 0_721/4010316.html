Among the things photographed, Richard used it for half, and half of it was donated to the Eternal Dragon Hall. Even so, it gradually pushed the total donation to 6 million, and only 200,000 less than Cardiff. gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif is fidgety, sweat is pouring out, and his clothes are wet, just then, the confidant he sent out finally came back and brought Coming back to a delicate little box, Cardiff opened it and saw that there was a neat and pure magic crystal. There were twenty pieces in total, so his heart settled down a little. This is the Tucson family can give him The maximum support, and the deadline for returning is very strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Cardiff is now in a dilemma, even if he wins now, and then he can successfully put Lina in the bag, it can only be considered a slight earn, not to mention Lina is still an uncertain variable. If she loses, the loss will be close to 10 million. For Cardiff, it is definitely a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now regretted rushing and Richard gambled on this game, looking at Richard’s appearance, donating more than three million self-use materials at six million. In addition, he is still a bit of a sparer, how can he have so many cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation, there is no progress, Cardiff called a cup of spirits, a drink, then red eyes into the auction, donation The amount has risen to eight million in a blink of an eye. Richard is still worse than Cardiff 200,000, but there are only less than ten high-purity magic crystals in the Cardiff box, and Richard has spent an extra hundred. Wan bought three or four epic-level equipment, which are still designated for use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction hall is already silent, and everyone has not thought that this gambling will actually evolve to such a degree, there are people who know more about the equipment industry, and even I was surprised to think of another place. The total price of the equipment that Archimonde sold in FS at these years did not know whether there were more than ten million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since the auction, Li Chafeng has spent a thousand and two million, and it is always a spare force, from the beginning That's it, it's still the case, and Richard's performance has already exceeded the scope of the nouveau riche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Gordon said, people tend to look down on nouveau riche, but when a person breaks beyond a certain limit, people's views on him will become respectful, awe, admire or hate, but in the end will not look down again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreaks that Richard now shows are beyond the psychological limits of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Jiadifu again and suddenly smiled and said: "Baron, do you want to take a few pieces of land, I see that your funds seem to be insufficient "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hot, I...I..." Cardiff felt the whole cheek burning, but years of self-discipline finally played a role, but a bit calm Down, even if the eyes that Richard looked at were full of ridicule and contempt, how could he be ashamed and not crazy to that extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif almost spurted out the fire in the eyes of Richard, but he did not dare to let go of the words, in front of many nobles, what he said It must be honored, otherwise it will become without dignity and credibility. It will be difficult to rise in the future. If he loses this bet, it will only be a major economic loss, but the territory and the plane are different. It is a noble. The skeleton is that they support the badge on the title of the nobles, and the gold coins or resources can be used to earn and then go to mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Cardiff refused to be fooled, and some regretfully shook his head and continued to focus on the auctioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Richard pushed the donation to more than nine million and successfully overtaked Cardiff, while Cardiff was short of breath and stiff. Stretched a hand and grabbed a few in the box next to it, his fingers scratched at the bottom of the box, but did not touch a high-purity magic crystal, so he finally knew that he was finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction also came to an end, and the auction was not a single item, but a set of magic light chain armor, suitable for almost all arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This batch of light chain armor is a quasi-epic-level equipment, the price of a single set is 30,000 gold coins, and the total number of sets is up to 200 pieces. The price is as high as six million auctions. At the same time, it can be seen that Noland pays attention to the plane war. Such war equipment often overwhelm some precious and rare materials and become the finale of the auction. This is also Nolan. One of the traditions of the German auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricing of such war equipment is very accurate, there is no special reason, there will be no order of magnitude fluctuations, so in the end, Richard took the magic light chain armor at the unit price of 36,000, ready to be reserved for the future nesting elite. Unit use. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the auctioneer announced that Richard successfully captured the light chain, the auction room sounded a breath of cold air, at this auction. On the other hand, Richard has sold out 20 million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s face is so gray, it is only then that the original theory is compared to wealth, and he and Richard are not at the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard’s understatement and taking seven thin sheets of paper with royal marks from his pocket, he finally broke out and roared at Richard: “You Cheating, the money is royal, not yours, I have not lost this gamble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li eyebrows pick one, faintly said: I have already said that if you are not convinced, you can go to the territory or the private plane to pay the bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nyris Horan stood up, The delicate little face was tight and said coldly: "The Count of Cardiff, please pay attention to your wording. I hereby guarantee that the royal family has not intervened in the gambling bureau. Master Richard is completely gambling with his own wealth. My explanation ends here. If you are still dissatisfied, then let the Duke of Tucson file a motion in the House of Lords. Then the royal family and the members of the parliament form a investigation team to investigate the fairness of the gambling. Count Cardiff, you are sure to do this. Do you do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif’s lips opened and closed a few times, but no If you say anything, if you do this, you are prepared to completely expand the matter. Regardless of the truth, you will first tear the face with the four emperors, and if the investigation does not get the evidence he wants, the result will be even worse. That means that the Tucson family has completely stood on the opposite side of Archimonde and the royal family. Others don’t say that he can’t pass the Duke of Tucson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Cardiff can only represent himself, but not the entire Tucson family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the magic clock and said to Count Cardiff: "The time is almost out, Count Cardiff, will you continue to gamble?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... I, admit defeat..." Cardiff's voice was hoarse, like the ascetic who had just stepped out of the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of his followers were ashamed, especially the middle-aged aristocrats who had torn Rina 200,000. They looked at Richard with the eyes of a monster, and couldn’t believe that the scene would be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 ​​million,. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is 20 million in cash rather than assets, and an auction has used 20 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the testimony of many nobles, Cardiff has no possibility of remorse, he has not had cash, but he has to pay three million bets, and finally only It can be proposed to compensate for gambling debts in the territory of Noland, which will be the territory of a prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Richard thought about it, he suggested that if you can pick it out in the territory of Cardiff’s private name, then you can let the valuation of each territory rise. In 10%, this valuation will be carried out by a special appraiser as usual, and registered by the royal family, with sufficient fairness and authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper to 10% means that Earl Cardiff lost less than 200,000, so he also agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the map title of the territory of the Count of Cardiff was taken, and Richard looked at it and chose a one not far from the Black Rose Castle. At the Linhai viscount collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk sent by the aristocratic coat of arms marked the map title, and then retired, followed by territorial value assessment, sovereign transfer, etc. A series of trivial matters, naturally, it is not necessary for Richard to handle it personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then enter the most exciting part, and the part that everyone is looking forward to, two slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Richard is a magician, and Count Cardiff is a sanctuary, although the face is one of the most vulnerable parts of the human body, but Once the vindictiveness is up, even if you can't reach the realm of killing the enemy with your face, you will definitely have more self-protection. Then you can see if the reactionary force is enough to hurt people. As a magician, Richard, if you really slap a slap in the face Going up, maybe the palms will become bloody, and Cardiff’s face may not be able to stay with a red stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddif stood in the middle of the auction floor, his upper body leaned forward slightly and smiled at Richard and said, "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
