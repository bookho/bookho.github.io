Raymond's eyebrows picked a pick and said: "I can let you come over once, I think it is not easy to meet this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Yes, she wants to take me." Grab it, control it, then let me let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond sighed: "She is just talented and easily enters the sanctuary." I am not very hard, and I have not experienced a few battles. How can I catch you? The result of this battle is that she has fallen into your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "No, we didn't have a hands-on. Now I guess she is thinking about how to make me feel better, so that you can be less guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't seem to be guilty now," Raymond said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just that I don't want you to be guilty for a while." Richard sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mental punishment, you can actually try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechah laughed: "I recently had a soul pastor and a son of a god, which one do you want to choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s face changed and finally stopped Speaking, falling in the hands of the Soul of the Soul or the Son of God, the soul will sink forever, and death is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha poured a cup of tea for himself, and said slowly: "Leia can’t get anything, she knows this, I have never broken her identity from beginning to end. With her cleverness, I must be able to guess why, I think, she will eventually give up everything she wants, you think."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely," Raymond said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Raymond and sighed after a moment and said, "You don't want to do something for her."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond was silent for a moment and said: "I can't do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make me very disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is tit for tat: "No, you should be happy because I am not so easy to yield to the opponent, between us The hatred is not resolved. What you want is not to see my struggles and pains. The more I insist, the more fun you will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard shook the teacup in his hand and silenced for a moment. He said slowly: "Remember what I said to you on the day of our decisive battle. You are just a trouble on my way, so you are suffering or not, I am actually Don't care, if you have already, let Nai You come to entertain you. The reason why I am holding you is to let you be punished for what you have done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond laughed: "What is the difference between what I did and what you did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Completely different, I am more than you More confident, in addition, I am the winner." Richard responded faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s laughter came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Richard threw the next sentence: "If you want a little more sense of existence, then you can make some suggestions about what I am doing, no matter what. That is a suggestion or a trap, I welcome it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed, Raymond is still sitting, the sky is very sunny, the spring in the courtyard is beautiful, but he suddenly Feeling lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Faro’s spring, summer and autumn were calm, and the god’s truce was over, but there was no rush to start the war between the human kingdoms. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the territories of all human countries are generally fixed. The efforts to change the territory are mostly at the negotiating table and on the bed, not on the battlefield. Marriage is always better than A more effective means of territorial annexation of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is because of the calm of the blood-stained land. During this time, Richard has not taken the initiative to provoke any disputes, so naturally no one will be stupid. Going to provoke Richard, although everyone knows that every time, Richard’s strength will inevitably expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the main force of Richard is unstoppable, and the country neighboring him knows that his large army is advancing toward the Zuyuan Heights and has already crossed over. The steep wall of trade winds, successfully climbed the high ground and stepped into the traditional territory of the barbarians. Most of the wicked generals under Richard’s hands were transferred to the ancestral highlands, named in the blue water oasis city. In addition to Richard himself, there are only three church gods at the top of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the defense of Oasis City is exceptionally empty, but it can be said that its defense has not been weakened, because Richard is in Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of the Fifth Armed Forces of the Iron Triangle Empire is explaining this point. They started to fight in the first place, and they drove straight in. The followers of Richard could not be blocked. Bingfeng, it seems that it can sweep the entire bloody land, but they eventually provoked Richard, the blue camp, Licha and the half of the opponent's strength to smash the main force of the Fifth Corps, and even counterattack , the end of the fifth legion of the old army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard’s prestige has surpassed Saranwell and Li Shilongtu, and it is the first place in the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real strategists and strategists are even more uneasy at the moment, because Richard’s efforts to open up the ancestral highlands have succeeded, which means he has A vast rear, such a famous, if he has enough military power, and then there is enough strategic space, it is almost invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the legendary land after the turbulence of time, instead of worrying too much, after all, it is inconvenient to communicate with the mainland, and you can see the scale of Richard’s relationship. Some people have analyzed the composition of his army. Although there are many individual strongmen, ordinary soldiers are still recruited by local people. Moreover, Richard has a special feature and uses a large number of slave soldiers. This also shows that only the strong can pass through the time. Flow, so there is no need to worry that Richard’s family struggles with the millions of troops to have a complete impact on the pattern of the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the ancestral highland connected to the blood-stained land becomes the territory of Richard, it is completely another situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care what other people think, he just buried himself in the world of magic and construction, grinding himself one by one, and accumulating Next and one piece of construction, every time the sand in the magic sand leak drops, Richard's strength will slowly increase by one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who walk in and out of the plane from the plane, but Richard always moves between the magic lab and the meditation room, and the sand is in the ancestral highlands. Even Qi Qi went to the Zuyuan Heights. Qi Qi has reached a bottleneck and needs to break through the temper on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still people who have come to the blood-stained land and join the territory of Richard. Many people come here for the sake of faith. They want to convert to Li. Under the glory of the new god, he found that the new god did not recruit the believers at all, but these ascetics had already used up the tolls in the blood-stained land and could no longer go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the three goddesses are extremely generous in this respect, so they will have a return, a batch of mad believers are coming, and the power of faith added to the three goddesses is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every few days, the three goddesses express their joy in various ways, either to lower their gods or to show some miracles. Even directly raising the rank of a certain magician, the activity of the three goddesses in turn enhances the faith of the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this kind of activity, there is a precise but rather sloppy evaluation of the sand: "They are too long, suddenly rich, and excitement is inevitable." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, time passed, until the end of autumn and winter, the cold wind began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, the mother’s nest came to the news that it had reached the ninth order, and Richard looked up from the bench and glanced at the calendar on the wall. This is almost a year has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to return to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the test bench in front of him, and quietly placed a new life on it, but this life has been lost and the original drawings already have A little different, it brought more attack speeds, but the required carrying capacity decreased slightly, at the cost of further improvement in the difficulty of production. Richard took a box from the next shelf and opened it. It is also an improved life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took off his clothes, slightly meditation, and the complicated structure of the lines appeared on his arms, and the two lives squandered on their own, to Richard Flying, and then covering his forearm, Licha suddenly burst out two bloody fog, two new life has been merged with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li La pulls the rope, and after a few moments, Qi Qi walks in. She has completed the required experience and returned to Oasis City last month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you make something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all done.” Qi Qi said In the words, the face is still with a small pride, which is a very important step for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, more perfect than the best results I expected." Richard applauded and then pointed to the lab and said: Help me sort this out, I have to take a break, then you pack your things, and we will return to Noland a week later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Qi Qi responded, she began to skillfully sort out the magic materials scattered on the experimental table. At this moment, Richard suddenly patted his forehead and smiled: "I almost forgot, I promised you, if If you can complete the three works, you will be rewarded, let me think about it, and give you a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is said, but the eyes are clear, it is clearly thought out, and Qi Qi’s heartbeat suddenly became faster. I don’t know why, the heart that has always been calm and calm has started to waver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Qi Qi’s surprisingly long-awaited look, Li smiled and said, “Let’s go back to Noland, I will prepare a press conference for you. As a conference for the new builders, the three works are enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 was shocked and lost the voice: "What, send... conference, Belongs to my assembly conference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... This is not appropriate." Qi Qi tried to calm her breath and heartbeat, and restored her usual calm and calm, saying: "Master, this is my name for you, including myself, everything belongs to you, Whether I am a builder or a potential builder in the future, I don't need to have my own reputation and glory because..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I gave you a new life." Richard laughed and interrupted her. He has heard this sentence many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi took a deep breath and solemnly said: “Nothing is more important to me than this.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is the case, is there a release of your own that would be better for you? Well, this is the case," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi still wants to argue, but she is held up by Li, "Qi Qi, I did bring you a new life, but this time Since then, you have repaid all the debts to me, and you are more than enough, so don't think about anything. This is what you deserve. When the time is ripe in the future, I will return your freedom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi was surprised and asked: "You have to drive me away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
