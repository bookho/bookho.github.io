			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the cardinal of Nei is here, you will find a young nobleman Many of the things I read were exactly the same as those sent to the Pope's desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the direction of the nobles is somewhat different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no important behind the black hand, and his purpose is also very clear, that is, want to put Richard to death, or in a least honorable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how to put Richard to death is the key to the problem. If there are people in the room, there is no need to sit in the House every day to condemn and condemn every day, and directly send troops to the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy Richard... The pragmatic aristocrats thought of this thought, but they could not help but chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to eliminate Richard? The super-elite knights of Richard’s men were terrible and armed to the teeth! God knows where the money came from, and the equipment of these knights even overwhelmed the royal garrison, and the guards had only 500, and Richard was equipped with thousands of rides! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Richard’s strength is greatly damaged after the war, if the family behind him is indeed the legendary place of the turbulent time, who knows that he will How many backups will you get? Most aristocrats are not very convinced of the intruder's allegations. The only effective judgment of this kind of thing can only come from the gods. It is good to use it as an excuse, but without the endorsement of the church, it is an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elimination of Richard’s large interest is undoubtedly good for the entire Sequoia kingdom, but it is certain that the first one rushed to Richard The fools will definitely have no bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords was rarely cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the accusations of the young jazz spread throughout the Sequoia Kingdom as the wind, and naturally passed to the ears of Richard who had just returned to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened, just communicated to the mother's nest, and transferred the latest batch of reloaded barbarian infantry and humanoid elite knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two new elites have 11 levels of strength, each with a scale of about 100 people, coupled with Richard’s custom-made Nolan German equipment, the combat power can be said to be like a wolf. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee also mixed the returning Nolan's costume knight with his surviving knights, and made up for twenty rides. Then bring some ordinary humanoid knights, the total number reached 500 rides, and finally brought all the followers, left the blue water oasis, and opened to the kingdom of Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard’s team, including Lina and Mito’s two great magisters, ten of the twenty-chief knights are second-order suit knights. The leader is Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three powerful priests in the eternal dragon hall! In addition, the highest-ranking big man is the pope of the goddess of spring water. Philen can be said that he was directly captured by Richard. Since the arrival of Philen, Fermi and Xiyou naturally cannot be spared. The reason is simple. The accused god is the invading devil? If the church does not take a little attitude, how can we retain believers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lineup is to return to Noland, which is enough to level the territory of some small aristocrats, placed in the Sequoia kingdom of Faro, completely traversable. It was surrounded by tens of thousands of troops, and Richard also had the confidence to kill a few in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with a team like a wolf, Li is murderous and goes straight to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shenlin City is not strong enough, but it is prosperous, and there are more than 100,000 people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of the Sequoia Kingdom is not a military fortress, and there are no valuable natural resources around it. It has long been a prosperous trading city. The royal family has its own territory, which is the origin of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a completely undefended city, especially after the intruder incident, the troops that have been transferred have not yet completely left, and the gates are still stationed all the year round. A swordsman battalion, the preparation of the five hundred swordsmen is to shock, but also to show off the royal force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the guards just pushed away the heavy city gates and saw the smoke rising in the distance. A team of violent knights rolled in and went straight into the city. door! The magical light on the knights' equipment is almost swaying the eyes of the garrison captain! The other side of the army fluttered a bunch of flags, one of which is indeed the logo of the Sequoia kingdom, but the captain could not remember for a time that it was the guard of the kingdom aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wh...who?" The guard captain slammed his head in front of the knights and asked loudly. But the trembling in his voice could not be concealed, not because of anything else, but because the knights looked at his eyes so strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is nothing mysterious, human beings are also the food of the mother's nest, and the creation of the mother's nest is also a natural source of human beings, at most It’s okay to move the Li’s squadron. Therefore, these elite humanoid knights look at the guard captain with the look of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome and incomparable elf in the team is coming out, it is Oral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Elf poet is no longer a gentle and acting style, but instead points directly to the guard captain with a whip and roars: "You are blind!" Even the team of Richards dare to stop, are the flags all displayed? Can you not see the goddess of the three goddesses? Give me away, just dare to say a word, I will kill you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard captain stunned, and he secretly complained that he had never seen Richard himself, but the name was so eloquent, especially when these heavenly houses were troubled for a long time, I don’t know. It’s hard. If you put Richard into the kingdom, you will definitely be punished in the future. What's more, Richard also brought a whole set of heavy rides? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been hinted at by his superiors. If he encounters Richard or his messenger, despite his embarrassment and even humiliation, he or she cannot be allowed to His spokesperson stepped into the king. However, looking at the front is far more than the number of normal aristocratic guards, the army seems to be able to start the war immediately, and the guard captain feels that it is almost impossible to complete the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he hesitated, Oral had already whipped down! In this whip, the elf poet used enough vindictiveness to fly the guard captain out. The guard captain immediately showed a blood mark from the forehead to the neck. The whole person flew backwards and fell to the ground, not moving. It was actually stunned by the elf poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangcheng guards are in a daze, and they are slashing their swords. However, these swordsmen are old fritters. When they see the momentum of the detectives, they dare to rush up, only screaming in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral said coldly: "In three seconds, who has a sword in his hand, kill it immediately! Don't blame me for not warning you before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately a sound of snoring sounded, the guardian swordsmen returned to the sheath, some timid and even directly throw the sword on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral snorted and waved his hand, and the Knights immediately entered the king. Going in the direction of the noble House of Lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it was the day when the young jazz released the Isaac in the House of Lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble House of Lords opened on time, and this time, ordinary people are still eating breakfast. In this way, the nobles flaunt their diligence and nobleness: we are already working when the people are still not awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young jazz came to the House of Lords as early as expected, and he didn’t look so nervous last time, and his looks became better. A lot, the face began to glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the podium, cleared his throat, and took out a thick stack of manuscript paper as usual, and began to read it. The so-called new criminal evidence is the structure that Richard sells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting information from the Baroque kingdom shows that many Noland strongs have complex magical lines, and the structure and pattern look like they are sold by Richard. That batch is exactly the same. Appraised by the Masters Association, the similarity between the two is astonishingly high, but the type and effect of the magic array is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the young Jazz even had the courage to shout: "Destroy Richard! Destroy the invaders!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most severe complaint. Once it is settled, Richard and all his family, including the closest allies, should be sent to the firearms, or shredded, and then fed to the beasts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords is silent, there is no applause from the young jazz, and there is no anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a solitary applause rang. In a deadly House of Lords, it seems so harsh. Everyone looked in the direction of the applause, only to see that he was walking into a person at the gate, that is, he was applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a very simple mage robe, and the three long knives behind it were particularly eye-catching. He walked to the podium and smiled at the young jazz who was a little older than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young jazz is still very impassioned, but now he is already stiff, can’t say a word, can’t move, can’t stand, can’t be said to be A miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha walked and said: "I heard that someone here accused me of being an alien invader. God, this is a serious accusation. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of Richard is very exaggerated, but it makes people laugh. The three long knives behind him and the destiny of the hands of the two, let all the nobles present to understand that Richard is definitely prepared, clearly a posture to prepare for full fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the half-closed door of the House of Lords was rudely opened, and dozens of heavily armed knights poured into the House. And many follow-up people of various shapes, that are followers of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
