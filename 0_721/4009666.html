			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new spring arrives, Little Richard is also childish. The hunting knife at his waist is no longer a display. He also began to hunt with the hunters in the village, although not too deep into the forest, in the face of Warcraft will not stand on the front line, the job assigned to him is more to lay hands, set traps and Packing up the prey, but at least it shows that he is already a hunter. The blacksmith Bobby was very happy, because Richard’s hunting knife was spent several nights with a few pieces of treasured steel. Xiao Licha used to kill a Warcraft, Bobby will be happy for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting is always dangerous, there are many unknown World of Warcraft hidden in the stretch of the coastal mountains, and occasionally there will be lost roads in the mountains to the Rutherland Village. Come. Xiao Licha met a gray devil wolf. This is a real second-level Warcraft, even if the village chief has to deal with it seriously. When encountering the devil wolf, there were only two hunters in the village around Xiao Licha. It was an arduous battle. All three people took a minor injury, but in the end they dragged the body of the demon wolf back to the village. What the villagers praised was that in the whole battle of the dead, Xiao Li was unusually calm and calm, and the response was correct, that is, the best hunters could not do better. And if it wasn’t for Xiao Li’s knife to cut off the ribs of the devil’s hind paws, it might be another result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this year, small and medium-sized Richards encountered a lot of danger, and he was always calm and calm. In a dangerous situation, he did not flinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of nine, Richard learned courage. This year seems to be the most relaxing year, because the children in the mountains never lack courage. But the courage that my mother taught Richard was different. Richard did it. From then on, my mother stopped calling him Little Richard, but my Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Richard is already a real man!" Every time I saw Richard, Elaine would always smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one day, Richard’s answer was: “The real man needs to be wise!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Ilian was taken aback and looked at Richard seriously, asking: "Tell Mom, who told you this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Written in the book!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which book?" Elaine asked patiently. Don't say that the magician, the knowledge of the magic apprentice is also very rich. Therefore, Richard has learned several languages ​​with Yilian, and even has a very difficult ancient language. Reading was no longer a problem for Richard. Even he had read several introductory books in the boring winter, but Elaine didn't remember which book had such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book in the attic, there are a lot of interesting things inside. I first knew that the world is so big." Excited to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that book?" Ilan remembered something and then smiled again: "The book is very interesting. My Richard, a real Of course, men can't lack wisdom, but perseverance, strength and courage are even more rare. My Richard is so smart, I will not lack wisdom when I grow up. So my mother must first cultivate your personality, do you understand? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And happy!" Richard rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan smiled and touched Richard’s head and said, “Yes, there is happiness! Is my Richard happy in the past few years?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Lichao shook his head and said with a sullen voice: "Not always happy. Piru bullied me, and I hate breadfruit. Also, mother, what kind of person is Dad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilian’s face changed a moment, then said softly: “Your father is a real man...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately went on to say: "I know! He is also the worst villain! It is the most hated person of the mother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yilian laughs Laughter, every year, Richard has to ask such questions several times, and she has always answered this question. Now Richard can be backed up early. However, Richard is a clever child. He can understand the deep hatred of Elaine when he mentioned his father. For a long time, Richard also hated this father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are many times, when Richard wakes up in the middle of the night, he will hear his mother crying softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic of the child is very simple. Mom is the one who loves him the most and is his favorite person. What the mother hates, that is, he hates it. Every once in a while, Richard will ask his father about it. On the one hand, he is curious, because as long as he grows up, his mother will tell him more about his father. On the other hand, Richard wants to know more about his father, so he can avenge his mother when he grows up. As for how to take revenge, he is still a child now, of course, no clue, but this matter has been remembered in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Elaine didn’t tell Richard more about his father, but just said that her time with Richard’s father was very short, she I only know so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, you will know your father very well." I don't know why, Elaine suddenly said this. As soon as this sentence was exported, her face changed, as if her heart was squatting. Elaine himself does not know why he said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly aware that his mother’s mood suddenly deteriorated, so she spit out her tongue and said, “I went to read the book,” and ran. In the back room. There is Yilian’s study, and next to it is the laboratory for dispensing medicine. There are not many books in the study, they are all magical foundations, the introduction of pharmacy and the knowledge of the history and geography of the mainland, and the identity of the Yilian magic apprentice. Richard likes to study here at night. There is a magic light in the study, the light is not bright, and I can fill the magic light for one night with the magic of Elaine. Because the oil is very expensive, in addition to the village chief, the blacksmith and the most powerful hunters in the evening, only Elaine is the only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this simple but warm little room, Richard quietly passed his childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those thick books, he saw another world, a world that is broader, more complex, far-reaching, and more magnificent than Rutherland. Little Richard has been quietly thinking that when he grows into the best hunter in the village, he must take his mother and leave the village of Rutherland to see the world outside the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ili was sitting alone in the living room, and the sound of the book was heard. Xiao Licha is reading hard, he has mastered the basic magic knowledge, but there is no real learning magic. Elaine even forbids him to practice meditation. On the mainland, if you want to be a good magician, you should start your first meditation from the age of four or five, so that you can accumulate enough mental strength at the age of ten to start the study of magic and the cultivation of magic. However, Xiao Li did not feel that there was anything wrong with this because he did not understand anything, and because he felt that his mother was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
