			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard are constantly flashing, switching between the real view and the normal view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After switching to real vision, Richard can see the flow of energy in the void. Here, the remains of the Star Power explosion are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, Su Hailun experienced an earth-shattering battle here. This time she did not keep her hands, the opponents were unusually strong, and the battle between the two sides directly destroyed this fragile plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the enemy of Su Hailun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, Richard saw a large remnant of the powerful chaotic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a chaotic creature, but Richard uses the real field to examine the power of the rules contained in the chaotic power, but discovers the power of the rule. Extremely complex and powerful, it has transcended the level of general rules across the plane, and is close to touching the underlying rules of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was all over the body chilling, and if the battle with Su Hailun was so strong, then Su Hailun was mostly fierce. Even the chance to escape is extremely embarrassing. You know, even the great lords of the abyss, not every one has the ability to touch the underlying rules of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing came to Richard and saw that his face was pale and his body trembled, so he looked at him and saw the blond hair. So suddenly it was cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...does..." Unspeakable words suddenly said it was very difficult, and the lips began to tremble uncontrollably. . This is the first time she has been so ill in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly shook his head and said, "I don't know, should there be... chances?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that this sentence can not convince himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, suddenly flew to the distance, grabbed a piece of desktop size, and flew back. In her hands, it is a huge scale! Just look at the size of this scale, you can imagine how large the original main body shape will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not say a word, grabbed the scales, and pointed out three consecutive imaginary bombs on the top, using three regular forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order and neutrality left a deep hole in the scales, while the chaotic force only played a shallow pit. Richard’s current power of a bomb can easily penetrate the legendary shield, but he can’t hit the scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Licha are slightly stunned, and the voice has been brought with a trace of dryness: "It is a chaotic behemoth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Chaotic behemoth!" Undecided and shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic behemoth she has not only heard of it, but also seen it far away. In the outer world, the chaotic behemoth is the ultimate disaster, and no one who has encountered it has ever returned. People's poor understanding of chaotic behemoths comes from some aliens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Helun encounters a chaotic behemoth, it is mostly fierce. Looking at the scene, Su Hailun has already injured the chaotic behemoth, and the strength of the battle is already incredible. But this is still not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard swept the battlefield. From the traces of the remains, the chaotic behemoth was nearly 10,000 meters long. Moreover, Su Hailun even used more than ten times of space bursting such a big killer, but the damage caused to it is still limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the limitation of space bursting, which is similar to the lethality and range of individual damage. When you encounter an opponent who is exceptionally strong, your power will be greatly reduced. If it is against an opponent such as a chaotic behemoth, Richard's blue fire, or the suit effect combined with the sacred fighting technique, will be ash, and the killing power will be above the space burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time does not know how long it has passed, and the traces left now are incomplete. The battle between Su Helun and the chaotic behemoth has a dramatic impact on the rules of the surrounding environment, and Richard's real vision can see the trajectory of the rule change. He relied on this way to restore the scope of the battle of the day, which is naturally quite inaccurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is standing beside her. Although her hands are stained with the blood of countless powerful people, the role she can play in this situation is extremely limited. I can only stand there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard’s look suddenly moved, and the whole person was instantly transmitted hundreds of kilometers away. Here, another little blue star force floated out of the void and landed in Richard's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's face changed immediately, because this blue star power is the mark left after the battle between Su Helun and the Chaos Beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing appears immediately around Richard and asks: "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Know, prepare for the battle, let us look at it." After all, Richard grabbed the indefinite and sent to the place where the stars were floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after dozens of transmissions, Richard finally came to the location marked by the star, and also the battlefield of Su Hailun and the chaotic behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the battlefield, there is nothing, only a huge black hole, slowly running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainly staring at the black hole for a while, suddenly changed color, said: "This is not a black hole, but a space channel! But now it is changing to a black hole. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes and said, "It should be their last blow, completely breaking through the space, and forming such a channel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard immediately became firm and said, "You are waiting for me here, I will go in and see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Nothing screamed: "You are crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have not crossed the order channel? What is different from this!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing screams: "Nonsense! Can these two be the same? Don't go! Otherwise..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise what happens, she suddenly can’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard picked up the space equipment and handed it to the indeterminate hand and said, "If I can’t come back, help me. Bring these back, take care of my family by the way. I will give you the half-face of Su Hailun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No double eyebrows upside down, The face is full of murderous, angry: "If you can't come back, I want those meanings of broken things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will come back Richard said with a smile, and then he couldn't decide to oppose it again. He suddenly turned and flew up, and a few flashes disappeared into the black hole in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing quietly, standing still, like a statue. I don't know how long it took, she suddenly covered her mouth, and then felt like there were two hot things rolling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange feeling, she never thought about appearing on her own. Even at the beginning...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when she was angry and far away from the foreign domain, she never did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is unclear why this is. This is not for Richard, nor for Su Helun. Su Hailun has a deadly appeal to her, but it is not the kind of feeling of love to the extreme, but more like the attraction of two tyrannical instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must find a reason, perhaps for Richard and Su Helun. They made it impossible to see something she thought was there and then no longer believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal vortex is a polar movement, and it is also very quiet. Here is the breathing place of the world. Chaos and order meet here, the old rules are annihilated at any time, and new rules are always produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the whole world's miracles, now in the inconsistency, are not as important as the black hole that has not yet been fully generated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood quietly, holding Richard’s space ring and bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the channel really turns into a black hole, Richard is unlikely to return. At that time, I didn’t know what to do. She may be able to complete Richard's entrustment, but it is also possible to directly invest in the black hole, where he completely annihilated himself. She is not for anyone, but just suddenly feels bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired because, in this world, there is no longer anyone who can make her interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Richard’s entrustment, it does not matter at all in the uncertain heart. A person who is already dead, still worried about so much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hole is becoming more powerful every minute and every second, and the flame in the infinite eye is gradually extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, her hand was unable to open, the space ring and bracelet slipped from the fingertips, and then drifted away under the traction of turbulent gravity. Without a fixed mind, her body slowly floats and then drifts to the black hole. The closer you are, the faster you fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She simply closed her eyes and relaxed her body, and this was the last time in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the helpless drifting, she suddenly felt a whole body, a pair of powerful arms suddenly hugged her, and then dragged her away from the black hole very arbitrarily! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the whole body, suddenly opened his eyes and saw the face of Richard’s impatience. He turned, grabbed the space ring and the bracelet, and then made a beast-like whisper, and said: "Transfer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely dangerous move, It takes a lot of energy to drive such a magic in the gods, and Richard is now very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the portal was formed in front of it, there were numerous tiny cracks in the body, and the thin bloodshots were like fog. He didn't scream and slammed into the portal with his indefinite force, and he went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the portal, a glimpse of the black gas from the black hole, like a life, spread quickly and quickly wrapped around Richard’s feet. go with. But only a fraction of a millimeter, Richard has disappeared into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal that stayed in place immediately exploded, burning a dazzling fireball in the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas was burned a little by the fire, and it immediately curled up, screaming like a baby crying, and then reluctantly returned to the black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tens of thousands of kilometers, Richard and Undecided fell out of the void, and Richard could not handle the wound, and immediately swung his hand in the air to create A large portal was then rushed in. The next moment, they appeared on the semi-level surface of Richard, and then two people fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to sit up, but he has long been weak and has fallen back. This time touched his whole body wound, and suddenly his face was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a breath, Richard turned his head and stared at him. He said, "I am not letting you wait for me? What are you doing?" ?! I also count on you to take me out of the black hole! Now it's good, if I just learned the script of the gods, I was almost just..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
