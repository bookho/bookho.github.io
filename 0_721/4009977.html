Only provide the prisoners with half of the normal share of food? This is contrary to the custom of the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is in the expectation of Richard, so I spread my hand. Very bluntly replied: "I am now less than half the number of prisoners. Just in case, they must limit their food rations. If they don't have enough food, they will not run away. I know this and the nobility tradition. Too consistent, but now the situation is special. Besides, as long as the noble Him is fed, isn’t it enough?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street Jazz nodded and agreed, then Solemnly said: "Li Cha, as a private suggestion, no matter how much prejudice you have against the Viscount, you should not hurt him as much as possible. In the blood of the last four generations of the royal family, the Viscount is The only one who awakened the bloody owner of the upper sacred abilities, so he is significant to the entire royal family. As far as I know, His Majesty the King and the Presbyterian Church have planned to let the Viscounts of Shim leave at least twenty descendants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will let Him to Him The territory launched an offensive?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you let him go?" Sir Shandon is not a fool, and smiles ask Richard to have nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two conflicts between Him and Richard ended in the end with a great victory for Richard, and the development of the situation was largely Richard. Intentional. As he and the quicksand said, Viscount Heim is a rare enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sammon did not continue to ask, but said to Richard: "But as long as it does not hurt the Viscount's **, it does not touch the bottom line of the royal family. The dispute between you is purely a private grievance between the nobles. The Duke of Glasgow and the royal family will remain neutral and will not get involved. In the worst case, the Countess’s father, the Count of Crow, will intervene in the war, but I don’t think he will be open. Participate in the war and support the operation of Viscount Heim at most in the form of private assistance. From your past record, the Count of Crow is a threat, but it cannot shake your foundation. Moreover, once he directly participates in the war, it means giving it at the same time. You are attacking the legitimacy of his territory, I don’t think he will do this.” Speaking, Sir Shanton laughed a few times. "The most famous specialty of the Viscount's territory is the daffodil, but the count is rich in Lafite iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Sir Shandon. Nodded and said, "Well, I know what to do. Then I will not give in easily this ransom negotiation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residence of the messenger It is a separate two-storey wooden building, which is a temporary building like the residence of Richard. But seeing the desolate scene on the territory of Richard, Shandon did not have too much picky. After a simple wash, Shandon invited Richard to share afternoon tea in the living room. Black tea and refreshments are brought by the jazz. The gesture of seeing his tea should pay attention to this aspect of enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a black tea, Shanton left the servant to leave the living room, and then took out a letter and handed it to Richard, saying, "This is what the Duke gave you." A personal letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the envelope with two pages of stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the courtesy greetings, the Duke mainly mentioned the relationship between the royal family and the three Dukes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow with royal blood is the natural ally of the royal family, and the Duke of the Wolf and the Duke of Tulips will unite at some point to fight Gera Duke of Fort and the royal family. The royal family and the three dukes have contradictions with each other, so in this case, politics is a very important factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique and mysterious blood power is the root of the royal family, but as time goes on, the blood power is becoming thin. Therefore, the appearance of the Viscount of Hem, the significance of the royal family is particularly important. If Xim succeeded in giving birth to descendants with blood power, then the royal family will be carefully cultivated, and it is likely to become a generation of strong powers. But that was at least twenty or thirty years later, and the Duke hinted in the lines that a strong country has no ability to change the situation, let alone a possible strongman after twenty years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fully understood the Duke’s suggestion. Viscount Heim himself is a standard embarrassment, no big use. If you take into account the probability that his offspring will have blood power, then consider the chances that the blood force grows into a strong country--the Nolan's standard sanctuary, even one percent. Richard and Palin are willing to let go, how can you kill Him for a vain future sanctuary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha continued to read, and in the following, the Duke stated the importance of the Viscount of Hem, but also implicitly revealed that the royal family valued It is the fertility of the Viscount, not his face. Richard couldn't help but raise his eyebrows and read the passage again. It seems to imply that he does not have to worry about the ranks of the Sanctuary in a small conflict of domestic aristocracy. The most interesting is still behind, the Duke even hinted that the existence of the Viscount is actually a burden of the Duke of Glasgow and the royal family, and cannot be easily destroyed. This is contrary to Richard's view to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the letter, the Duke mentioned that he had sent a batch of supplies to Richard as an advance payment for the next batch of construction. The supplies include four city defenses and supporting arrows, as well as equipment capable of arming two hundred warriors. Although it is not a magical battle, it is more than enough to equip his current little castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke also mentioned that a 300-foot swordsman battalion was stationed not far from the territory of Richard, nominally adding borders to the Duke’s extended territory. . If Richard can't cope with it, he can go there to avoid it. The command of the swordsman battalion will temporarily belong to Richard and protect him from deep rock city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this paragraph, Richard’s eyes swept at normal speed and did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second page is a list of the materials brought by Shandon and the steel components that will be shipped for castle defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading, Richard ignited the letter paper on the candlelight and burned it out. Then he said to Shandun: "Thank you very much for the generosity of the Duke! What else does the Duke want to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of words can't fall on paper . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandong smiled and said: "The Duke told me to tell you that he is preparing for the war against the Principality of White Rock. The army should be opened within half a month. The goal of this time is the Count of Galleon, the Principality of the White Rocks. The real purpose of the Duke is a giant dragon bone displayed in the castle of Earl of Galleon. Well, that is so much. After you check the materials, I have to catch up. Back to the deep rock city. The Duke needs to know the current situation of the Viscount, and when the army leaves, I will escort the second batch of supplies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your hard work However, how did the Baron Xiaofang Dan deal with it? He cut off the road that I and the duke led." Li asked. Baron Xiaofang Dan was separated from the vassal relationship with the Duke, and was also in the traffic, but the military power was weak at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samsson Sinked a bit and said, "I don't have any personal advice for you in this area. But before I set off, I discussed this with the Duke. The duke means that it is your sole responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
