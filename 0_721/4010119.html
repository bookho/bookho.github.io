			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard looked up and said to everyone: "Tomorrow, we will There is no way to give a surprise to Allenwell...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of doubt, Richard added the following sentence: "Because he is used to being us Go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." "Hmm..." "Ha..." These listlessnesses are all from the followers of Richard. They obviously didn't catch a cold joke about Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, Saranwell did not have a surprise, but a gloomy command to withdraw troops. The soldiers who withdrew from Oasis City were much less than the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, Salenwell put all his troops into the siege, and even the cavalry that did not adapt to the street fighting was no exception. So, by dusk, he also harvested the biggest casualty number in four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day...there is no fifth day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of the fifth day, Saranwell finally took his troops and disappeared into the horizon on the north. Compared with the size of the time, the troops he brought back were only one-third of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oasis City, there is a long-lasting cheer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four days of fighting, there are 50,000 lives ending here. The emperor dropped nearly 20,000 bodies on this small land, while the Richard side paid the price of more than 30,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the blue water meat grinder has little effect on the Iron Triangle Empire, but it is an extremely heavy blow to Salenville. After the campaign, Richard’s name gradually spread to the blood-stained land. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the news that Saranwell had withdrawn, the reinforcements from all over the Sequoia Kingdom had found it too late to intercept, and many of them withdrew. However, the troops planning to participate in the Long Line plan are still rushing to Oasis City. There are still many people who did not intend to participate in the Longitudinal Plan. After hearing the results of the city of Oasis, they also changed their minds. The original second line plan did not have their position, but these aristocrats were prepared to create a fact. Their idea is that we are helping you. Now that the troops have arrived in Oasis, do you have to give me some location? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day of the end of the war, the army of the Sequoia Kingdom arrived in Oasis City. One of the greatest strengths came from the Duke of Glasgow, a large army consisting of three thousand cavalry and five thousand infantry. The leader was an acquaintance that Richard had never seen before, Count Latu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second power was unexpected, and it turned out to be the army of Countess Ekaterina. This is a 4,000-strong force, but it includes a full five hundred elite reloading knights. The knights of these knights are also elite cavalry, reaching 1,500 people. This batch of knights with an average rank of nine, the strength is no worse than the Knights of the Duke of Glasgow, and the luxury of the equipment is more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When receiving this force, Richard could not help but be speechless. To be honest, it is simply not suitable for reloading knights in blood-stained areas. Countess Ekaterina’s move is more to show off her financial strength and strength. However, as long as this unit is willing to listen to the command, Richard does not mind the extra strength of the battle. In the past, the hardest part of the battle was actually done by his humanoid warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I heard the arrival of this unit, the face of Viscount Heim was a bit ugly. Countess Ekaterina, this is to show off the force in the naked land, and to show off to the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf sent a force of more than 2,000 people, which consisted of a reconnaissance cavalry, a light cavalry and a regular cavalry, and a thousand infantry. The troops, who did not reload the knight and reloaded the infantry, were well trained and well suited to action in the bloody land. This is a practical force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aristocrats put together the troops, there are also thousands of people. When the Oasis City troops gathered, Richard also breathed a sigh of relief from the war. When examining this city that had been turned into ruins, Richard once again felt the horror of Salenwell. If it wasn't for him to launch a slave, and to fully exert his ability in the melee, relying on the complex terrain of Oasis City for four days, it would really be cleared of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard found out that he couldn’t finish his work. First of all, his power has expanded unprecedentedly, and his army has exceeded 10,000 people for the first time. But this is completely false prosperity. Nearly nine thousand of the 10,000 troops are the original slaves. They have separated from the slave status and become the soldiers of Richard because they have accumulated enough military power. Richard’s original promise was that as long as he killed an imperial warrior, he could get rid of slavery and become a civilian warrior under his command. The number of slaves originally assigned to weapons was 30,000, but in just two days of fierce fighting, their number was reduced to less than 10,000. Neither the nobles nor the Richards, they did not expect that these slaves would be so timid and indifferent to the fight for freedom, so desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not need so many troops, but after seeing the number of aristocratic troops assembled, he changed his mind and put all the slaves who were willing to join the army. Keep it, and slowly filter it later. The army of the nobility also needs to be adapted. In the end, according to Richard’s expectation, it is a force of about 10,000 people. But the troops who left them, how much they left, and how to adapt them are the three major problems facing Richard. Richard knows that if one month can solve these problems, it is fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard is also facing the problem of rebuilding the Blue Water Oasis City. Fortunately, he has now received the support of more than a dozen business groups, and the aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom are also on his side, so the reconstruction process is much faster than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general of the Duke of the Wolf also brought the news of the Duke. After ten days, the Duke will come to the Blue Water Oasis City with the secret of Palin. The letter also mentioned that the Duke brought a special item that could be used in special ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Richard was very surprised. In such a short period of time, did the Duke find another sacrifice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was still a period of time since the arrival of the Duke, so after Richard arranged the affairs of the next few days, he took the Gangde, backed up the prepared materials, quietly Transfer back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the transmission array, he just saw the Nolan big priest who had rushed in. Nolan saw Richard, first of all, and looked up and down Richard carefully before and then said: "Lee! How did you become like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Changed?" Richard is also a glimpse, habitually touched his chin, touched a layer of short hard beard, and then understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at Richard intricately. In her eyes, although Richard had a beard, he still looked unusually young. In her impression, Richard only walked for a few days, but this time, it changed too much. The original elegance and delicateness faded a lot, and some of the green scorpions were not seen at all, but replaced with the taste of blood and fire. If the original Richard is like a tall and straight Aoki, then he is now a hot rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
