			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Richard to speak, the woman of the forest called to him: "External, flee, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is really in a daze, let him react for a moment, but the attitude of this elf girl, Since she already knew that Richard was an outsider, how could she not attack but instead let him run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard was in a dull state, the Elf girl couldn’t care much, grabbed Richard’s hand and pulled him to start running and let her accident The speed of Richard's running is quite fast, and it didn't bring much drag to her. However, the sharp whistle sounded one after another, and there were whistle sounds in all directions. Actually, a huge encirclement has been formed, and now the pocket is gathering. The elf girl's face flashed a struggle, reached out and touched the big bow behind her, and then bite her teeth, pulling Richard and rushing in one direction, looking at her expression, this is intended to be hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me, I know a hidden path." Richard suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl suddenly stunned, there is a "hidden path" in the forest, the guardian elves are mostly running on the tree, there is no need for the road The women who can trace and surround the forest are the top hunters in the guardian elves, all of whom are qualified to enter the Ordinary Defender Tribe Presbyterian Church. Under this best hunter, what kind of path is there? Hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time it’s Richard’s turn to not think about her, clenching her little hand, and pulling her to change her direction, then rushing, Li The speed of the inspection is not too fast. The course of the run is a curved bend. Sometimes it will even rush straight toward the hunter in front. The elf girl’s heart jumps out, but she dares not speak out. The distance between the two sides is too close. The elf girl knows that her breathing and heartbeat are likely to be captured by the other party, not to mention talking, but although Richard is rushing forward, the hunter on the opposite side has turned a strange direction to the other. A direction to go, and Richard and the Elf girl can be said to pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl instinctively wants to exclaim, but fortunately grabbed her mouth in time, and then she was suddenly brought a hand by Richard’s hand. The great power brought her whole person to fly, and Richard suddenly accelerated, and the speed reached a level of horror. In the twinkling of an eye, the encirclement was left behind and then ran to the depths of Lin Hai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After escaping more than ten kilometers, Richard stopped and gasped: "For the time being, how is it, this path is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf Girl 瞪I widened my eyes and stared at Richard. I only felt confused in my head. When I ran this way, I saw a path, but this young outsider could actually get under the eyes of a large number of top hunters. It’s really just lucky to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The Elf girl didn't know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "My name is Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am... Mei Lin, is a forest... an ordinary elf in the forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Ordinary elves, the guys who chase you seem to be very "It's amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline had a red face and didn't know how to lie, but at this time, Richard took the initiative to give her a break and asked: "You know I am an outsider, how can I take me away? The guardian elves in this forest seem to be fighting immediately when they see the outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mei Lin shook her head. "Not all outsiders are bad people. Before you start, at least you have to figure it out. In addition, you have a taste close to the forest. It will not be a bad person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad man." Richard did not know how long it had not been heard so simple, but it also shows that Melin’s innocence is simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li asked: "Why are they chasing you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline's face Dark, said: "A lot of our thoughts are different from them, so they want to force us to yield in this way. These people don't want to kill me. They just want to take me back, so that my people can make concessions." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked more interested and said, "Oh, let me talk, what is the difference between your ideas."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline hesitated for a while before saying: "This is the case, mainly about outsiders, our tribes are not willing to participate in the war of outsiders, and the elders think we should try In contact with outsiders, she said that outsiders will change every once in a while. We need to be in contact with outsiders and we must not lock ourselves in the forest forever. Otherwise, our plane will fall sooner or later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded hard and said: "It’s true that you know what you are saying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a heartfelt statement from Li, which is very natural and sincere, as a foreigner The leader of the leader, Richard is very aware of the nature of the plane war, as long as he gives him enough time, then completely conquering Greenson may be only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline’s attitude towards Richard was a little unexpected, but she sighed and said, “It’s not that simple, the other guardian elves almost insist on keeping The ancient tradition is to launch an endless war for the outsiders, so we are very isolated and, more importantly, the world tree is also the will to destroy all outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "External, you are very interesting, actually do not need the name of the intruder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline sighed, did not answer directly, but said: "If you have a chance, you may know, but it won't be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what are you going to do next, I can hurt you." Help a little busy." Speaking, Li raised his hand to the elf girl's empty space, the moon of the azure month surging, the grass on the feet of the two people suddenly poured out countless young grass, and then bloomed with white flowers. The nature and life that is transformed by the moon force flows into the body of the Elf girl, and her Potential cure of the half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl once again widened her eyes and said: "You are a great Druid, but this power is somewhat different from those of Druid." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "I am an outsider, of course there will be some differences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elf girl moved her body and felt that she had lost most of her injuries. Surprise: "Your natural spells are so good, then... I am going to the Aoba tribe to win their support. It is a big tribe, they are The tree of life has grown to the late stage of maturity, only one step to completeness, and some of their elders have a relatively mild attitude toward outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is Who is chasing you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the wind, rain and water sound tribes, they are only slightly weaker than the Aoba tribe." Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, then do you know how many guardian elves are in this forest?" Richard asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline doesn’t feel that she is being taken out of the vital information, calmly saying: “I know a total of nine, and some are me. I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will send you to the Aoba tribe. If the hunters of these tribes catch up, I will always I can find hidden paths and escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of Richard makes it impossible for Melin to refuse, and Richard has the ability to escape and heal. When they go to the hunter, they can take the initiative. If there is no Richard, Melin can't escape to get the Aoba tribe, and she wants to go deeper and say to Richard: "You are willing to I went to meet the elders of the Aoba tribe. I want them to see you and let them see that an outsider can also get the forest. I think you are the best evidence to convince them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Melin’s shining eyes, Richard laughed and said: “I don’t think it’s a good idea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be a lot of people in the Aoba tribe who strongly oppose the outsiders, I think more than half Supporting you more." Richard finished, smiled and went on to say: "And, I am not a good-tempered person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, you are very good." Melin said, then the little face flashed a trace of sorrow and said: "You are right. In fact, only two or three of the nine elders of the Aoba tribe may help us. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Richard looked curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline sighed and said, "Tell you on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Qing The middle of the leaf tribe was quite far away. Richard and Melin walked for a week and walked nearly two thousand kilometers before they reached the territory of the Aoba tribe. As soon as this went, Richard knew how big the Greenson plane was. I also understand why I can't find the traces of other trees of life. According to Melin, the distance from her Yongyao tribe to Aoba can only be said to be "medium". In this way, other trees of life Most of them have migrated to the base city for a thousand kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
