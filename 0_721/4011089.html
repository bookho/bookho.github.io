			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cycle, the power of faith returns the golden world tree with the breath of world rules, on the one hand providing the roots of the golden world tree growing, on the other hand Gradually let these blank souls enrich. The memory of every life is actually a certain expression of the rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hilo played a key role in it. Among all the night elves, only the soul of Hilo is perfect. In order to create and perfect this soul, the Brood has exhausted all of its abilities, and from now on, it can no longer create new special units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this new race, the existence of Hilo itself is the end of the evolution of all night elves. With this perfect soul as a frame of reference, the souls of other night elves can be gradually improved in the course of continuous reincarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, as a perfect existence, Hilo has no bottlenecks in evolution. His power can always be raised to the upper limit acceptable to the rules of the plane. In this way, Hilo will truly become the patron saint of the night elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shocking plan, and Richard saw that it has been successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha checked Chahiro’s information and found that the so-called new god of the night elf had already reached level 27, so he entered the super without any hindrance. The ranks of the strong. You must know that Richard's current magic is only 28, but the magic level has little effect on Richard's strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilo is the first follower of Richard’s entry into the ranks of superpowers, although he is currently the weakest superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Hilo doing?" asked Li. He found that he actually lost control of Hilo. Hilo is now the god of the night elves, constantly collecting the power of faith, and will ignite the fire. Before the fire, the original bondage of the soul was not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest replied: "He is going to Linhai deep to destroy the world tree there. This plane no longer needs a second world tree." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While continuing to flip through the information, Richard said, "Oh, that is, he is still chasing more powerful power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Pursuit of strength and perfection is the nature of Hilo, and it is the ultimate goal I designed for him." The mother's nest replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "It’s really strong. After a while, I can surpass me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest was silenced for a moment before saying: "Beyond you should be sooner or later. Hilo is a near perfect creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "His level is really high." Richard said undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the level of Richard, the level is not everything, it can even be said that it is no longer important, the rules are the real master. When Richard was less than 27, in the abyss and on the battlefield of Abis bloody battle, he killed a lot of big lords of level 30 or above, and even 33 strong lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nucleus is obviously unable to understand the meaning of Richard’s words. It paused for a while and solemnly said: "His Royal Highness, I have no intention of being an enemy of you. Since you have already returned, I will still abide by your orders in the following time, and all the stored night elf warriors will still be The sword in your hands. My only request is to keep my creations and make the night elves a true race that can be propagated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nod and said, "That's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent a few minutes building a huge portal in the air, and went in safely. . The huge mother nest suddenly trembled, and the golden world tree swayed with some uneasiness. They all feel the breath of other planes from this portal. It is not Norand, but Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has no need to build a special transmission array, but can directly transfer between the planes by his own power, even without using the void as a springboard. This means that Richard's control of the underlying rules of the world has reached an unimaginable height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time on the other side of Greenson, Hilo suddenly stopped and watched vigilantly. His face was a little pale and his eyes flashed uneasy. Just now, an unspeakable heart suddenly shrouded his entire soul, almost letting the elf who had stepped into the ranks of the superpowers planted from the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilo was so alarmed that he couldn't imagine what it would be to fear himself. The heart rushed away, but the big fear in an instant was deeply imprinted in the depths of his soul. Hilo felt that he had met a natural enemy, and that moment seemed to have lost even the ability to resist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down and his face slowly returned to normal. Hilo suddenly opened the giant bow, and a magical light turned into a long arrow, which was automatically placed on the bowstring. A few magic arrows flew into the forest like the wind, and there were several screams. The farthest sound is even outside the kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferior shooting of several sacred-level guardian elf shooters and Druid, Hilo did not feel happy. Just the kind of heart-rending fear has already taken root in his heart, so that when he thinks about it, he feels cold all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the perfect elf does not allow this accident to interfere with his pursuit of a strong road, and Hilo forcibly suppresses the uneasiness of his heart and continues to move forward. In the distance, an incomparably large canopy has emerged looming. That is the world tree of Green Forest, the ruler of the entire plane once supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world tree has the most powerful guardian elves, but now they are equivalent to completely harmless bugs for Hilo. Just a few days ago, the only two legends of the Guardian Elf tribe: the Great Druid and the Holy Warrior, were already dead under Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the green world tree in the distance, Hilo gradually became excited, his body temperature rose slightly, and he ousted the chill. He threw the uneasiness aside. The capture of the world tree has a special meaning for him, not just to eliminate an enemy for the Golden World tree. Hilo can take the most essential part of the energy from the world tree and raise his rank again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you reach level 28, is it sure you can exceed Richard? Hilo thought silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abyss of Abis, Richard is only 26th. It’s been a long time since the abyss battle, and maybe Richard’s upgrade is also possible. But even if Richard is upgraded to a higher level, the level will not be higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark night elf from perfection to strength is becoming more and more hot, vacating and rushing to the distant green forest tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard had arrived at Faro and passed through the wormhole to the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro is still the appearance of the rest of the robbery, the area that the reaper has ravaged, the ecosystem has been fundamentally destroyed, and the self-healing of the source is long. Slow, but the hope of a new life is still growing stubbornly from the ruins. Under the policy of vigorously encouraging fertility, the population of the entire Faro has doubled after the war and will continue to grow at a high speed in the foreseeable future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent place is still the same, but the maternal unit that comes in and out here is even more strange and more entrenched. Looking around, you can see huge-sized insect-shaped combat units crawling around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big guys who are hundreds of meters long have the strength to match the figure. Among them, elite units already have 20 levels of strength. If we consider the strong resilience of the nesting units and the characteristics of being afraid of death, their true combat power is still above the ordinary sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky above the turbulent land, Richard sighed. When he really stood at the peak, he discovered that he was not the army that needed the mother nest. This is somewhat ironic. When the mother's nest force finally formed, Richard did not need it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what Li is really concerned about is the mother nest itself, or the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest in the center of the turbulent land has completely changed. It is now suspended in the air, and its posture has become more slender, with dozens of streamers-like tentacles slowly dancing around the body. The length of the mother's nest has reached five kilometers, and the whole body has a beautiful streamlined shape. The body surface is a mysterious pattern of large dark gold. From the shape of the light, it can be seen that the current nest is known for its speed and flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the body of the mother's nest, a small figure is sitting there with his knees, quietly watching the distant sky. When Richard slowly fell in front of her, she took a while to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"李察!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea never hide their emotions and directly throw in In the arms of Richard, he overwhelmed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee simply relaxed, lying on his back on his mother's nest, asking: "How long is it possible to go to the 16th order?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
