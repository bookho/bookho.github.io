Another name The young god said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, using that weapon would consume too much of the Fountain of God, which would cause the entire Holy City to collapse." The oldest god said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the Holy City did not collapse, but it fell into the hands of the Nolanders, and what is the difference with the collapse." Young gods said fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the old god has also improved: "It is not the same, as long as the holy city is still there, we will have hope, the Nolanders cannot permanently occupy Lan, as long as we all share the hearts of the Shulan people, there will always be a day to drive the Nolanders out of Shulan, and the Holy City will return to us at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy City must not fall into the hands of the Nolanders. It is not only sly and defiled, but it is possible to break the secrets of the Holy City and disturb the sleep of the gods." The young god is almost screaming. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged gods have been hesitating and have not expressed their opinions. In the case where the two gods disagreed, his opinion was decisive, and the more so The more difficult it is to draw conclusions, just as he gradually leaned toward the opinions of young gods, the old god said coldly: "You should not confuse the purpose and meaning of our existence, and really regard yourself as a god. The barrier to the real nest. How many years have we studied for generations, but there has been some progress. If the Nolanders come, how can they break the barrier?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young god made a clear statement, saying: "But...but this time the Nolanders are different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is not? In the same way, they just brought a knight who is beyond our imagination. The real strong is not as good as the invaders. The last intruder was blocked by us on the bridge of the mainland. If the prince is incompetent, how can he lose the bridge of the mainland?" Fight back again, and the young God's face front green white front, a time to speak, so that if it was his elder brother Prince, such accusations, God let the young how to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, now that the enemy has reached the foot of the holy city, it will soon enter the city. It is meaningless to blame the responsibility of anyone. Now, I think..." After feeling that the middle-aged god did not speak again, when he really wanted to make a decision, he realized that he was still difficult to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we should listen to the opinions of His Royal Highness," said the young god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, she is not still recuperating, now awakening her, there will be irreversible damage." The old god made the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Holy City is occupied, will it not fall down now, and now there is something to be hurt." This is the rebuttal of the young gods. The old god could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a quiet voice suddenly sounded in the hall: "Really, it is not important that I am not hurt at this moment." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness." The three gods turned their heads at the same time and saw a shadow that was forming in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged god is even more shocked. "When you go down the temple, how do you come out in the form of a soul? What can you do? We communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is the great commander of the holy city warrior, and one of the two legendary powerhouses, but unlike the dragon star, it is by itself She is a true legend when she enters the legendary realm. Therefore, among the five people in the Holy City, the position of the day has always been the first. However, when Gotton moved to the bridge of the mainland, he fought and fought every day, at the expense of his own serious injuries. Successfully blocked the strongman of the Gordon side at the southern end of the mark of God's Weeping, but the cost of the war was more painful than expected. After she was hit by Modred, the injury has not recovered. Come over, but gradually become heavy. In recent years, it has often fallen into a few months of sleep, so that the injury will not deteriorate, and now she appears in the soul, which will have a considerable negative impact on the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three gods made His Highness, I appeared in the way of the soul, because there are very urgent things, I have to do this." On a daily basis, she is extremely serious The tone made the three gods startled, and they all knew that His Highness had never spoken in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Immediately notify Long Xing, let him mark the person at any cost, and then we use the light of God's punishment, and must kill him." The semi-transparent body of the day also exudes a strong murderousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment she is pointing, it is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The light of divine punishment, but..." What the old god wants to say, the middle-aged god interrupted him and said: "It is so decided And start the light of divine punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old god sighed, no longer insisted, but stood on the corner of the round table, the other two gods also stood in the corresponding position, the three gods stretched their hands, chanting mysterious spells, a light band from them The hands emerged, forming a complete circle above the platform, connecting the three gods into one, in the center of the halo, a cross star appeared, and then swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the old gods were able to ask: "When you go down the court, why spend so much to destroy this person, his absolute strength is not worth it. "That."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this has nothing to do with his strength, I feel that he has established a connection with the Nest." Say, there is a hint of panic in the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three gods made the same face change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, although the dragon star was chased, he still refused to give up, but continued to circle around the battlefield, looking for opportunities, he suddenly The whole body was shocked, and the face was stunned and intertwined. It turned out that the Three Gods had already passed the day-to-day decision to him through a mysterious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing stared at Richard, and almost fired in his eyes. He didn’t really care about Richard’s identity, but because the new task was hating Richard. Because the position of Richard’s station is very insidious now, not only under the protection of 50 members of the formation of the knights, but also can call another team of 20 riders to support the formation, but the dragon star has to Adding a tracking mark to Richard in a very short period of time, God knows why it is only within 100 meters to be able to add a tracking mark to the target. At this moment, Li Wang looked to Long Xing, and the two men’s eyes came into contact. Richard’s first look was a glimpse, and then thoughtfully, Long Xing’s heart Secretly screaming is not good, his face is only strong and calm, so as not to be alert, but Richard suddenly retreats, pulling away the distance between the dragon and the dragon, and the other forty rides are clearing the last holy city samurai The knights have also turned around and inserted into the gap between Richard and Dragon Star at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing’s heart screamed and sneaked into Richard, knowing that this was the last chance, the whole body swelled, and the wave was a huge fireball. He went to Richard, and then he immediately hugged his knees and rushed to Richard under the vindictive package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball was bombarded by the spears of the knights, and soon it was blown up in the air, and Richard opened without hesitation. Carrying the book, one after another, the bloody lightning flashes in the air, and constantly bombards the dragon star. Every lightning will make the dragon star's body temperament a little bit thin, and let his speed drop a little, and Richard will cast the speed of magic. Going up is not very fast, the action is more calm, it seems that there is no such thing as a full-fledged raid of a legendary strongman. The fact is also true. Most of Longxing’s abilities have been used, with his current strength and legendary ability. Presumably, there is nowhere to go. After the baptism of the absolute battlefield, Richard’s grasp of time and space has reached a certain level. The reason why he is not in a hurry is to be able to enter the attack range in the Dragon Star. Before dumping all the magic in the book of the bearer on the dragon star, then there is still room to choose to fight or escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon star flew in the air in a hundred meters, and both Achilles and Faschi were behind him due to an unexpected assault. On the flank, the bloody paladin who was also known for speed was marching alongside him, though At this speed, Senma can't attack, but as long as the dragon star enters the attack state, Senma can attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the scene, there are countless vindictive spots on the ground, a spear throwing the sky into the sky, intercepting the dragon star, and constructing the knight’s attack. As a result, only a few throwing spears are thrown at the Dragon Star, and the rest are cast around the Dragon Star, so that when the Spear begins to track the Dragon Star, no matter which direction he flees, he will pull close to some throwing spears. There was a glimpse of a glimpse in the eye, and suddenly it accelerated to the front of the throwing spears, and even hit the spear on the throwing spear. In a flash, the dragon star again showed the strong character, punched and kicked, and flew in the air. A number of throwing spears, and finally only hard against the bombardment of the next three spears, and he has temporarily broken the blockade of throwing spears, flew to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already pumped his knife in his hand, his feet are slightly open, and he is firmly nailed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One magic and magical continually lifted off, slammed on the dragon's body, slammed him violently, and tens of meters above Richard. Red Dragon Carlo flew out of the portal, its eyes immediately stared at the Dragon Star, opened a big mouth, there is a sparking star in the throat, brewing, for Carlo, Long Star is an old rival, so The cowardly legendary powerhouse is his favorite enemy. The attack of few legendary strongmen is so soft and powerless as the dragon star. It is not very painful to hit the body. If it is in Noland, the legendary strongman waved between there. You can tear a large piece of Carlo scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of the adult red dragon is not lower than that of the human strong, and in most cases it is even worse, so Carlo is not eager to attack, but quiet The ground waits in the low air. It knows that the target of the dragon star is Richard, so it is not going to spend the effort and the dragon star to hide and seek. It is the only way to get stuck in the dragon star. If the dragon star refuses to come, he is in the sky. It can't last long. He can fly faster than the throwing spear of the knight, but the time is very short. When the speed of the dragon star falls, it is his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol excitedly flowed out of the dragon, it has not tasted the legendary strong for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Dragon Star once again surprised everyone. He did not drop the height, but straightly passed the 100 meters above the head of Richard’s head. After several magic and spear bombardment, he accelerated to fly into the distance and fled the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
