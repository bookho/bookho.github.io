			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary is just staring at the Cavaliers with contempt Squirting fire. The right hand that has been cut off is not shattered. Although it can be picked up in the temple, it will inevitably affect his power to a great extent. I don't know how much effort it takes to get back to the original level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud and clear voice coming from above: "When it comes to arrogance, how can the Joseph family compare to the Millennium Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers looked up into the sky, only to see a gryphon rushing down, and the people on the gryphon couldn’t wait for the gryphon to land, and jumped directly from the ground when there was still 100 meters. The meteor rushed to the ground, and then the figure flashed, standing in front of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man with a sharp edge like a tomahawk. His hair is a weird lavender. It seems that he has not calmed down from the situation. There is no wind behind him. Self-raising. His murderousness has been as rich as the essence, actually condensed into a few purple runes in his body, and the ring is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the Cavaliers and only took three steps. Every step falls, the purple vindictiveness will rise sharply. When the third step is down, the purple vindictiveness has turned into a huge fire column of up to tens of meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that there is such a godly momentum, this is a pale purple hair, that is, the Count of Salisbury Joseph of the Joseph family, the 20th grade Warrior, a well-deserved powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Cavaliers stood in front of Sally, but they were unmoved, but faintly said: "Know that it is the mountain and the sea to give to Richard Akmon. Dear's sacrifice, do you dare to grab it? Are you trying to cause a war with the Millennium Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sali stared at the Cavaliers for a while, suddenly His face changed and he smiled coldly: "It turned out to be a dragon and an adult! I really didn't expect that the head of the Tang Dynasty Oak Leaf Knights would actually become a small guard and sneak up to the volcano here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Hao smiled and said: "If I don't come, this ancient beast bone may be stolen by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel rock snorted unsatisfactorily, but did not say anything. His meaning is very clear, that is, the dragon does not come, and no one wants to take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ancient beast bone!" Sally was also taken aback, the involuntary voice line was slightly higher, then the eyes became extremely sharp, and the grudges were even more ups and downs. Screamed: "Is the mountain and the sea not the sacred man of the barbarian? What is the relationship with your millennial empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Hao said: "The mountain and the sea are under It is the granddaughter of the emperor, and the student of my master's possession of the sword. How does it have nothing to do with the millennial empire? Have you stayed in shiedad for too long, even the things on the mainland don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Juggernaut Musashi made Sally's face change. He slammed his teeth and said, "In any case, this thing must be handed over to me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock sneered two times and walked to Sally when he made a big stride, but his thick legs just lifted up and he was pulled back by the dragon. "This is already my business now!" Long Hao said to Steel Rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the steel rock, the dragon's eyes suddenly suddenly cold, said faintly: "You want this thing? Simple, to kill me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salihaha burst into laughter, purple vindictively gathered a battle axe and said: "We are all 20, do you think that there is a sword master, you will be able to beat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock couldn’t help it. He held his finger joints and squeaked. He smiled and said: "Where did this idiot come from? Or give it to me, guarantee three minutes. He took him down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Hao reached out and stopped, but did not touch the steel rock, but still blocked his momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Longyan’s long sword is not automatically sheathed. He just raises his hand and holds the hilt, slowly pulling the sword, revealing the half-sword in the sunset Reflecting the bright light of the sun, the glare can not see the material. He stared at Sally and said coldly: "It's all 20 levels? Very good. If you can pick me up, the sword will not let you die. I will let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Sally's face is blue and white, and the hand holding the axe is shaking. He knows that when the dragon and the sword are completely detached from the sheath, it is the time when the dragon and the dragon are attacking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double sword is slowly detached from the sheath, the blade is trembled, and the long-sounding sound of the dragon is getting louder and louder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment of the double-sword off the sheath, Sally screamed and turned away. The purple vindictiveness of the fog, rolled up the Sanctuary and all the knights, and flew straight to the floating island of the Joseph family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragonfly! I am giving face to Juggernaut, but I am not afraid of you!" Sally's voice came from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon snorted and the swords slowly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock squirted a bite, failed to fight a battle, so that he only felt that something was wrong all over the body, hatefully asked: "How does this guy run? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon has converged all the momentum, and then pulled on the knight mask, and became the same as the ordinary maple oak knight. Hearing the question of the steel rock, he smiled and said: "This time the wrong is the Joseph family. If the war with the empire is provoked, then the emperor will never let them go. Maybe he will directly take his The corpse was given to the emperor. So I killed him and it was a white kill. This guy didn't think I would be here, the momentum came, but there was no step, I had to run back. Of course, in the upper class, the Joseph family is this time. "The face is completely gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock nodded hard, and understood what it was, saying: "This is the face. But they insulted the mountain and Under the Highness of the Sea! It’s not enough to hit the face! When I return to the mainland of Calando, I will bring my army to visit the Holy Alliance...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say: "Trust me, I have given them a profound lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel rock stared at the dragonfly for a long time, remembered that he had just been disabled The sanctuary strongman and a small team of knights, hesitated and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team continued to set off. After the recent changes, no one who did not open his eyes dared to intercept the team. So the ancient beast bones finally handed over to the old butler, so that the floating island 7-2 has become even more hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient beast bone, at the same level as the dragon, can at least hold an intermediate sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the ancient beast bones entered the floating island of Archimonde, Joseph’s floating island suddenly sounded Sally’s roar: “This bastard! It’s so embarrassing!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
