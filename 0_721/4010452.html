Although they are lucky enough to survive, but after finishing the construction, there is no more money left. They are not alone. There is a whole family behind them. Just as I have some spare power, I will help them. "Most of them are standard builds and it doesn't take much time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's it. The old man pointed to the bottom column of the list and asked: "Breaking the dream, don't tell me that this is not the one." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "Of course it is a broken dream, I feel that I owe something to her, so I also make a dress for her, of course, This is to collect money, just because I still have some tolls. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toll, where are you going?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard just finished a piece of film, stretched a slightly stiff body, and said with a smile: "The rising sun, you are not I feel that it is more suitable for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly got excited and waved his arm and snarled: "The bird is not even full of defensive magic, it is much more dangerous than here." What's good, and that's where the Dax Sodas have just lived, smelling everywhere, and where it compares to the sun. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While putting the finished piece into the box, Richard said, "I like the dangerous place." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't like it here." Lawrence suddenly said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe. "There was a response from Richard." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence became more serious and said: "The marshal is very old-fashioned, but also very fair. From the heart, he is a good one." people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped the movement in his hand, looked up and looked at the old man's eyes, and said seriously: "I know, so I didn't blame." He, but I can never be in the same place with Hastings, so for the marshal, this is also a multiple-choice question. I or Hastings, choose one, have no choice, now I think the marshal has already made The choice, then I am leaving. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no good thing in the world, and any decision has to pay the price, even if it is Long Dested. After a pause, Richard added: "And I really think that the rising sun is more suitable for me. Compared with danger, I am even more reluctant to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Lawrence finally sighed and did not persuade, but Richard asked him: "Old man, don't you go with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence shook his head and said, "I have lived here for decades. I am familiar with the taste of every brick. Now I am too old to walk, I don't want to change places. In the last few years, I still want to. Stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will always see you, old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lawrence seems to think of something, suddenly piled up a smile, said: "Li Cha, you do not feel that I owe me a lot of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old man laughs like a blooming chrysanthemum, there is absolutely nothing good, and Richard immediately warns him and asks, "What do you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you a gift, but you are afraid of it." The old man looked at himself with a sacred expression, ran out all the way, ran back again, and handed a box of magical boxes for a few years to Richard. The place where the fingers were pinched also left a trace of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received a hesitation for a second, resisted the urge to use a cleansing tool, and opened it, it was actually a stack of structures. It looks like at least a dozen sheets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning it over, Richard discovered that these structures are exquisitely crafted, of sophisticated structure, and that the requirements for magic and carrying capacity are not high, absolutely top level. s work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many structures, still so high, this box of things is not worth mentioning, there is no problem with changing top prizes, but Lawrence sends such a valuable one. Give a gift to yourself, how can you laugh so arrogantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took a random outfit and carefully figured out that the concept of this structure is very unique. Many functional magic arrays have never been seen with Richard. Even with his knowledge, there are several magical arrays in which the functions are not clear, let alone the calculation of the integrated superposition effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying for a while, Richard became more and more confused and asked: "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a lot of functions, you see, here may The speed of the carrier is slightly increased, and the function here is..." Lawrence cites a dozen features of the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha couldn’t help but pick an eyebrow. It’s no wonder that he couldn’t figure out the comprehensive effect at the moment. It turned out that this thing completely contradicts the classic design idea, single frame The more the function is, the better it is. In general, the more functions, the lower the effectiveness of each function. Therefore, in the eyes of Richard, this structure is completely a chicken rib. Perhaps its only advantage is that it does not need to be too With a lot of carrying capacity, people with a little ability can be installed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the introduction, Lawrence laughed and said in a voice that was almost inaudible: "In fact, it has a function that can be needed. Inspire, then let the carrier go without moving..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly understood the operation of this strange structure, which Lawrence has always said The soft structure of the foot, but he did not think at the time, but the so-called soft structure of the design is completely open for generations, this is the real master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this magical array is the key, you have to do this inside, then make changes like this, fill in the three blanks, and then inject your own The blood and the soul can be completed, and it is guaranteed that only you can stimulate this structure from now on. This magic array is also very important. Its role is to prevent the structure from being disassembled after loading, except for you. If the installer wants to dismantle it, it will bring unbearable pain to the bearer, and there will be substantial harm. In fact, it is necessary to dismantle it. The real strong is not bad for this bearing capacity. Those who really rely on this point The guy who eats, with or without this capacity, is no different. Anyway, it is waste.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s words, no matter how ridiculous, tells Richard Two functional magic arrays are the essence of this structure, perhaps the heart of the old man's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha selectively introduces the shackles of the old man’s long story into his mind, and at the same time begins to derive deductions, which are surrounded by the two functional magical ideas. A series of installations have been made, and they have provided two new ideas for Richard. This is the core asset for a builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence finally stopped his mouth, and Richard was trying to thank him. The old man waved and stopped him. He said, "You don't have to thank me. If you really want to return my feelings, then it will do a trivial little thing for me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he took out a crumpled piece of paper from his arms, the fifty years ago that he had seen for Richard. The list of women, but this time the list has a few new names on the tail, and you don’t have to think about it. They must also belong to the people of that era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you really want to thank me, then send these outfits and put them on other people. Of course, it’s best to list them. These women, it's okay, it doesn't matter, any woman can do it, I think the water is good." The old man smiled and his eyes were fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is really unable to say a word, he was silent for a few minutes, then quickly put the list into his pocket, vaguely said: "I Try your best." As for what kind of level is called best effort, naturally only Richard knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this level has already made Lawrence satisfied, the old man enthusiastically patted Richard’s shoulder and was planning to persuade Richard to try the effect on the water. There was a voice outside the hospital: "Is there Master Richard, the marshal asked me to send you something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in." Richard is not easy Can get rid of the embarrassment of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors of the two Marshal Guards entered the courtyard, and each of them carried a huge box of magic, one of which was also seen by Richard, which was the original One of the three men who came to recruit black scorpion, but things have already been the result, he is only ordered to act, so Richard is not prepared to trouble him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warrior is surprisingly respectful to Richard, among whom Richard is in the face of him and the legendary mage, the reason for subduing the big magister, there are also With Richard's side-by-side bloody battle, he saw with his own eyes how many Dax Sodas died in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior handed over a list and said: "Master Richard, the final contribution and reward of this war has been counted, this is what you deserve. Part of the remuneration has already deducted the part that needs to be turned over to the public warehouse and to compensate for the long-term glorious operating expenses. You have passed the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, this is a very long list, which lists a total of 87 large and small sacrifices. The total value of the calculation is about three top sacrifices. It is no wonder that you need to install two whole magic boxes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
