			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old sergeant’s face is frozen with an indescribable shock and slowly bows his head. Looking at the chest, I don’t know when to have a dark knife, and then look up again, staring at the charming and enchanting face that suddenly appeared in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is very beautiful, and reveals a fascinating atmosphere. The misty eyes filled with water mist seem to stay forever in the moment of love with the lover. At this moment, she is almost attached to the old god officer, the two faces are less than ten centimeters apart. The old priest can even feel the hot, fragrant breath that she sprayed on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to bow his head, except for the deep and greasy gully on the chest of the woman’s chest, and the fact that almost all of it was exposed outside, the most shocking thing was She is holding the hands of the dagger's hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short sword completely did not enter the chest of the old priest, the wound almost did not expand, even the blood only oozing a trace of silk, but the sword tip is still on the chest, now Then replaced the hilt in front. As for when to change, but did not feel it at all, let alone see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest can't say a word, but the short sword cut through his spine, but did not pierce the heart, life is still strong in his chest The ground is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight suddenly sneered, but because of the beauty, the sneer of her is also more exotic. She suddenly put her left hand on the heart of the old god officer, and suddenly made a force, the entire left hand broke into the chest of the old priest! Then she took out her left hand and held a heart that was still striking in her hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest Zhang Zhang slammed his eyes and looked at the sky, his eyes gradually diverging. The knight stretched out the bloody red tongue, took a sip on his face, and then lifted the heart of the old priest to his mouth, slamming, and biting a piece of crispness and chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only chewed a few times, she frowned, slammed the minced meat and blood, and snorted: "Smelly! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the left hand raised, so the heart that was bitten a bit high. It also ignited a faint fire and made a faint trajectory in the air. A strong wind blew through, and the lion lion had swept across the air, swallowing the heart, and then fell into the group of soldiers who were still struggling to resist and fell down. It squinted at the eyes and couldn't help but sway, as if the heart was so negligent that it was so neat. And underneath it, several soldiers were stumped, and the soldiers were unable to live from the limbs that were occasionally twitched outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the body of the old priest was slowly reclining and plopped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight did not know where to pull out a white handkerchief and carefully wiped the blood on the left hand. The battle around is still fierce, but for her, the battle is over. Sure enough, the morale of the warriors who lost the support of the gods and officials was greatly reduced. The effect of all the magical blessings was completely eliminated, and the combat effectiveness dropped by 30%. At this time, more than a dozen black knights emerged from the portal, so the front line of the warrior's front finally collapsed, and the fierce battle became a one-sided slaughter, and the edge even began to show signs of rout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight was able to wipe the armor and wipe off the blood stains left by the mouth. However, although the blood stains on the lips were wiped clean, her lips were still red as if they were dripping blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at the body of the old priest who was still unwilling to close her eyes. The face was a disgusting disgust. She took a sip and said, "It’s all fifteen-level priests, but the taste is still so bad! Old guys Sure enough, you still have to find some fresh and delicious to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the battle is over, the fierce black Knights are in the two great magicians With the cooperation, all the soldiers have been killed, even if the soldiers on the edge of the battlefield want to escape have not been able to run a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly three meters high, the black knight leader came to the knight, the upper body almost bent to ninety degrees, only barely and the female knight, so respectful Question: "Adults, all enemies have been killed, our people have killed nine, and now there are seventy. What are you told?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The female knight slowly looks around the battlefield. Within the line of sight, there were more than six hundred bodies lying on the side, and more than half of the bodies were scattered around the dead black knights and the heterogeneous horses. The black knights, even their mounts, are extremely fierce before the death. The battlefield was filled with blood and blood, and the blood still flowed out of the corpse, almost reddening the entire battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, revealing the intoxicating expression of incomparable enjoyment, and muttered for a long time: "Wherever, wherever, The taste is always so good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knight leader laughed like a beast and said, "That is of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight opened her eyes and looked at the old priest and said, "The fact that the fifteen-level priest was actually dispatched is also a It’s a pity that it’s a bloody one. Unfortunately, it’s useless to have a few guys like this. Okay, hello to everyone, clean the battlefield in ten minutes, then let’s go see the people in the base. What are you doing, why our portal will be in such a damn place, and it has been ambushed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair ordered the order and took it to himself The giant scorpion lion riding on the road went and said coldly: "I hope that the base can find a few people with tastes! If today In the evening they can make me comfortable enough, I will consider spare the waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knight leader smiled low again and said: "It seems I can see more blood tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair said wickedly: "Less his/mother's sweeping mother!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knight leader shivered slightly and immediately accepted the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a nobility of Noland’s presence, not only will he recognize the one of the Schumpeter family’s double flowers, but he will also recognize Schumpeter. Elite warrior town bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knights are specially cultivated from the knight to the war horse. The personal benchmark strength is at least 12, and each knight is equipped with three standard equipment. Construction. At the end of the centuries, the Bear Peter family had only one hundred and fifty rides in the active town, and Sinclair brought over half of it at a time. It is also obvious that Schumpeter is sincere in keeping his family's position in that small circle. If Sinclair’s trip to this plane is lost, it is almost foreseeable that the Schumpeter family will be cleared out of the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair, who is just in his early twenties, has 15 levels of combat power. But personal combat power is not her most eye-catching place. Only on the battlefield, Sinclair's different styles can be fully utilized. If it wasn't for Archimonde's Ellie, she would suddenly rise like a comet, she might be the most brilliant female general of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
