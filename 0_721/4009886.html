			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Strick’s discoloration, the cavalry behind him also appeared a little The riots. The Blue Water Oasis is not far from the human kingdom, otherwise the Sequoia Kingdom and the Marquis of Allek will not appear. There is no special reason, no one wants to provoke a big magician, because that means almost dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Stick hesitated, Richard faintly pressed the last weight: "If you know it, put your hands and all the horses." Stay, then roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilke's face changed, and finally gathered into a smirk: "The hair is not long, the little nephew, dare to threaten me? No matter who your teacher is, I have to kill you today. When you die, you don't have to worry about how big the blood is. Kill me!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Strick's roar, the two wings each had twenty rides and they went out to kill the team that was placed on both wings. Strick himself led more than forty rides, passing through the obstacles at an unhurried speed, rushing to Richard's team! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilk also used an axe, a black axe, a glimmer of light between the waves, apparently a fine magical equipment. He rushed straight to Richard, and the splash appeared again behind Li, and made a wolf-like whistle. So the dozens of horses that followed Stick's obstacles were frightened, and half of the knights were dismissed. However, the five 12-level captains all controlled the horses, and Stricker's Majesty was a magic horse, and was not affected by the girl's breath, so he took the lead and went straight to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-pointed roaring rushed out from the side, and slammed into a horse, and even ran the horse together with the captain of the horse! Then he slammed his hammer and squatted on the chest of another horse, almost smashing his entire chest! The horse screamed and fell to the ground. The captain of the horse immediately saw the plane and jumped off the horse and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-pointed sizzling of the heavy armor is thunderous, the two hands are flying and the ball is dancing, but the point of departure is very particular, only the horse is not stunned. As a result, a captain judged the mistake and did not intercept the weapon of the ogre. He had to abandon the horse. Another captain screamed, swaying the hammer and squatting on the three-pointed body, while the ogre sneered and the hammer slammed out, slamming the captain's chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sounds, two heavy weapons almost hit each other at the same time, the power of the heavy weapon is the ogre wearing a thick armor can not be ignored, he painfully Howling, stepping back a few steps. The horses that were hit by the heavy hammer were kneeling in front of the knees, and the captain of the body was far away, and the one fell heavily on the ground. The captain’s anti-shock force did not disappear, and he could not control his body. If he fell, he suffered a minor injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ogre is constantly flashing sacred radiance, that is powerful healing, divine protection, and blessing. The ogre, who continued to hold three magical spells, roared in excitement and waved heavily to the last captain who was still on the move. He ignored the captain's attack, but changed his injury again and took the captain down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captains who fell off the horse are still groaning in pain, and a powerful treatment falls on the ogre, so the three-pointer is once again alive and well. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre has now allowed all the captains who are still on the ground to land. These 12-level captains have the jazz-level strength, but they are all wearing the heavy armor of the riding, and their strength has plummeted after the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
