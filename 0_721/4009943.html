			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard on the top of Gaochun City just looked down at Sinclair and Did not look at her again, forcing her eyes to black and weak and exhausted, to keep herself awake with supreme will, and continue to command the battle in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before destroying Sinclair, first cut off all her wings. The effect of the sand-sanding power flame and the prayers of Richardson’s letter is not known how long it can last. I don’t know how much power is left by Sinclair. Richard only knows that she should be as much as possible before she can steal it again. Kill the town bear knight. This is a battle against time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the battlefield, the wind teeth have completely spread out, forming an arc that encloses the entire battlefield, starting with the mother nest and centering on the battlefield. Approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the castles is still bloody and fierce. Every minute, dozens of soldiers will die incompletely, and there will be one or two town bear knights roaring from Falling in the city, it is the way for the soldiers to block the ectopic face of the devil with their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce konjac is squatting under the city, biting all the soldiers who fall from the city, whether it is a black warrior, a warrior or an ogre Occasionally, with several town bear knights who are using heavy weapons to destroy the castle gate, they will hit the barriers created by the fine iron. Their iron hooves are kicked on the gate, no less than the power of siege equipment, and flashing from time to time. In a short time, the gate of the fine iron was dented everywhere, and even cracks that could transmit light appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barons of the Baron are struggling to resist, all the reinforcement materials are used, and a magician is sweating for a very lengthy preparation. Topography. Even if he holds a magic scroll in his hand, it takes a long time to drive the terrain to transform the magic, and the humming process can't even have a syllable error. Once successful, a bag of up to two meters will rise in the wide doorway and become the strongest gate defense. They have already seen the power of the town bear knight leader charge, absolutely can not let these devils ride the World of Warcraft into the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres struggled with the konjac under the city. They were the only ones who fell from the city and could climb and continue to move. Although tiramisu has a slight gap, he and his brother will be supplemented with stone muscle surgery, but in the long struggle, both of them have been bitten and bruised. Fortunately, the Elf poet found a good position in the city, not only supporting them with war songs, but also shooting arrows from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha lightly bites his lower lip, forcibly maintains his inner calmness, and a calm command is issued, commanding the mixed group of soldiers to step into the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, in the short few minutes that the Baron and Richard entered the battle at the same time, in order to stop these Devil Knights, they sacrificed a dozen elites at once. More than 50 soldiers. At this point, after Richard took over the command again, the damage was immediately controlled, and the reasonable attack team played the best offensive and defensive ability. Although the bears of the town bear knights swayed, they would take away a few lives. However, this open space will be filled in by the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is purely the use of life to accumulate victory, but it is also the only way to victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the barbarian, the sand people or the baron's elite soldiers, at this moment are tight-looking, red eyes, and marched to the town bear knight, not afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Richard, it seems that the still chaotic situation has reached a watershed. Although there is still no grasp of victory, he does not want to wait any longer, but ordered all the wind teeth and the mother's nest to launch a general attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
