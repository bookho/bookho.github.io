			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accidental discovery of the ogre requires an exceptionally large number. The ogre is a natural and powerful race. Too large a quantity of food limits their number, not too much. It is definitely a huge project to catch 1,100 ogres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the Ogre needed so much?" Richard asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is based on racial potential. The more powerful it is, the more likely it is to develop the race of the strong, the more difficult it is to resolve, the master. If you I hope that I will create a dragon for you in the future, and it is not impossible. But I guess, you need to find me tens of thousands of dragons to swallow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thousands of dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that he was black. Don't say that tens of thousands of dragons, that is, tens of thousands of ogres, he does not know where to find. However, Richard frowned and asked: "But the resolution of the feather snake is more than 100%. I don't remember sending you a feather snake. Is it that you swallowed too many feather snakes in a turbulent place, or the development potential of this race? Too low?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The feathers are highly resolved because of the blood of the Holy Spirit you sent. The body of Zuka is a feather snake, and It has already entered the ranks of demigods. If you can give me a cup of dragon god blood, then I can at least create a red dragon for you, or a black dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the Dragon God... Richard decisively decided not to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! I know. There is one more thing, the mother's nest, why do you intervene in the battle of Gangde?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you asking about the battle against Orca? In fact, I have been collecting data on the battles of Gangde, and his commanding ability is at least three major levels worse than you. The humanoid knight is not used like him, so I took over the command of the humanoid knight, one to reduce the overall combat loss to a minimum, and the other is to demonstrate how to use my combat arms for Gangde. A group of humanoid knights that rushed up were the ones I first created. Their lives have already passed one-third, and they naturally need to be used first and consumed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the mother's nest made Richard completely speechless. He remembered that it was almost a year since the mother's nest created the first humanoid knight. Not only the humanoid knight, but also the other life units created by the mother's nest are under three years of natural life. Richard's wisdom talent instantly calculates that it is the best choice to use these combat units with few remaining lives to change lives with powerful enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the human world, reason is not the whole of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and asked: "Is there any way to improve the life of the elite human knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why? Three years of life is long enough. In fact, this is slightly beyond the optimal range. According to the intensity of the Faro War, the life of the combat unit is more suitable in a year or so, which will allow me to create combat units. The ability to improve by at least one-third."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't ask why, can you do it?" Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, this is absolutely unnecessary! I have created the combat units, only the divine twilight and the unicorn have their own soul. The other combat units are all without any soul. Their mission is to destroy the enemy at all costs. Master, please remember that all the combat units are consumables, not worthy, and should not be invested in them. Feelings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumables, a very apt word, is accurate enough to make you want to marry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Consumables!" Richard said wickedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest was unexpectedly silent for a while, saying: "Master, your current emotions are very unfavorable for your continued strength. Consumables are consumables, When necessary, they should be sacrificed in the first place. Master, your responsibility is very heavy, if you want to complete all the responsibilities, then there should be no such emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly burst into surprise: "Do you know what I think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, our soul In fact, there are interlaced parts. If you can know that my existence is the same, I can also feel some of your thoughts. Regarding responsibility, your thoughts are so strong, it is completely hard to give me. I just want to ignore it. As the Sands adults told you, I actually have a common soul piece with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaoyong’s strange feeling, today’s nest Surprisingly emotional. Until this moment, Richard felt that the mother's nest did have its own soul and had its own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you said, what should I do?" Richard did not know why he asked such a question, especially to the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest seems to be thinking hard, only after a while: "Master, if you want to do all the responsibilities that you have publicly and undisclosed, then It is necessary to abandon the so-called honour and right of wrong, and all decisions must be considered from the most realistic point of view."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." I took a deep breath and said slowly: "All the sins are carried by me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. You decided to embark on this. On the road, it is impossible to escape the sins of those mortals. If you are not burdened by you, you will be burdened by the people you love and care about. You have already awakened the first real name, and you should not evade it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand..." Richard sat up straight and said, "Thank you, the mother's nest. Right, I want to ask, you have Is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you asking for your real name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also have a real name ?" Richard was again horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am in tenth order, I will wake up my real name." The mother's nest replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! I will let you reach the tenth order as soon as possible!" Richard said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...One day, one day, you will regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is regret? Racha laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened the door and asked the attendant to call Gangde. After a while, Gangde walked in with a fog, and did not understand why Richard suddenly called him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many slaves do we have in hand?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far, a total of 37,000 slaves have been acquired, head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow, you pick 200 elves from the slaves, 300 barbarians, and 900 dwarves, and send them to the turbulent border zone. If the number is not enough, buy some from other slave traders, do you understand?" Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The turbulent land!" Gangde had a chill. Everyone in the followers of Richard knows what is hidden in the turbulent land. In this regard, Gangde has speculated on the fate of these slaves, and his heart can not help but be cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the change of Gangde’s expression in the eye, but just waved his hand and said faintly: “This is my decision, you can do it!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes! Head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Richard quietly returned to Novo Rand. He brought back a large amount of minerals. For more than four months, Faro’s income from tax collection, dividends to caravans, and sales of enchanting equipment totaled more than 1.6 million yuan. Richard used 300,000 yuan to supplement the magic material, and then gave the old butler 300,000 as the cost of maintaining the territory. Then he went to the basement of the family castle alone, launched the ultra-long-range transmission array to the dark blue, silently placed a small box in the center of the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box contains ten high-purity magic crystals, each of which can be exchanged for 100,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the ultra-long-range transmission array flashed, and the small box containing the magic crystal has disappeared. Richard did not wait for the response from the opposite side of the transmission line and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, there was a black gold image above the ultra-long-range transmission array. The gray dwarf held the box, and the chin was dropped when he was surprised. He looked around and shouted. : "Richard! Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the underground room is empty, and Richard has already left. In the large basement, only the voice of the gray dwarf is constantly echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has left the floating island and is on his way to the Eternal Dragon Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has determined that from this moment on, all sin and responsibility will be shouldered by one shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you return to the Greenson plane, everything is no different from when Richard left. All the warriors are still not cutting trees or frying trees. Since Deep Blue sent the second batch of improved gunpowder, Masters and Alchemists have invented new ways of playing in practice. For example, a small gunpowder is sealed in a sealed container, attached to the pit selected by the rock tree, and then armed with a full-armed warrior. The explosive fragments can't be worn through the refined body plate, but the rock will be blown out of a deep pit, and then the big warrior will shake it up or hit it, and it will fall. This method eliminates the delicate steps of drilling and adding gunpowder on the rock tree trunk. The process is rough and unrestrained, and the efficiency is improved a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to rock wood, other precious tree species can not be fried, but can only be carefully cut down using a felling axe, and then dragged back to finely cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the base city, the open space is getting bigger and bigger. The Green Sens have not appeared for a long time, and Druid is like a disappearance, so that Niris who wants to ambush them has been depressed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon are both shocked by the arrival of Sandru, they did not expect that Richard would find such a senior necromancer, and Still very talented, it seems that there is great hope for the promotion of the big magician. After the initial excitement of Greenson, Sandron quickly figured out the situation of Green Forest and his own mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
