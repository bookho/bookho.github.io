			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina followed Richard’s wooden house and stood behind him The corner of the mouth is a mysterious smile. She embraced her arms and looked at Schiller with a look of optimism. Schiller also followed, and went to Richard's side, his face was already ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina just wanted to say something, but Richard was waved and blocked her words. Richard did not look at Schiller at all, but looked up at the purple moon in the air and said faintly: "Tonight is the month of dyeing, Mr. Schiller, do you know what the month of dyeing means?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller said: "I am just a rough person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The month of dyeing Representing the wrath of Lulu, the god of the moon." Richard snarled in a sweet voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on Schiller's face stagnate, and said: "Hey, it's a rough person, don't understand the meaning of the young master. Is Aussie beautiful? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer Schiller's question, but asked: "What is this training camp called?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Acmemond Death Training Camp." Schiller answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the month of dyeing and faintly asked, "Mr. Schiller, I don't know your surname?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Torre," Schiller said, but his face changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the relationship between Archimonde and Torle?" Richard continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...has nothing to do with it." Schiller understood a little bit about Richard's meaning, and his face was almost gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So Mr. Schiller, your current strength is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller is silent For a moment, I said, "...the 19th level of the Dark Guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then turned his head and looked at Schiller, and the tone gradually turned into cold ice:" You are not Archimonde, not a legend, so Mr. Schiller, I don't understand what you think is the people in this training camp are your private property!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Schiller's pupil shrinks slightly, and his face is already murderous. Richard’s unshirkable reprimand made him unable to restrain himself. The death camp was only able to grow in his hands. It was his greatest achievement in the family's stable position. But it is undeniable that only in these years, the training camp received enough input from the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a reason for Richard’s daring to be so arrogant, and many of Akmon’s relationships are not good, the more bloody. The worse, Goliath and Gordon are typical, just like the enemy. The death camp was built on the site of Goliath and was of course controlled by the count, which means that Schiller was a Goliath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller also wanted to distinguish a few words, and suddenly his face changed, his eyes fixed on a delicate and small pale gold scroll that Richard took out. He is a person who knows the goods and immediately recognizes that this is a soul contract reel. If the Dragon Master Lina endorses the importance of Richard, then this soul contract reel plays a role several times that of Lina. The gods of eternal and timeless dragons are varied, but no matter who they are, if they get the soul contract reel, they will be satisfied with this god. To compare, a soul contract reel is about the same as a natural life extended for thirty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard threw the reel of the city to Schiller and said coldly: "I must know what it is. It is enough to make you understand that I am not here to talk and joke with you. I am here. The task of the line is not that you can intervene to change anything. Now you have two choices, one is to find a suitable candidate for this scroll, and the second is to leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul contract scroll always has a layer of pale golden light, vaguely revealing the time of the sky. Now in the hands, Schiller can confirm that this is the real thing. However, after confirming the authenticity, Schiller began to struggle. This lightweight scroll is gradually as heavy as the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Richard said, no one will make a joke with a soul contract, even if it’s bloodthirsty Philip will not do this. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the various resources provided by the family for the core members is a personal defender, which is one of the roles of the training camp, but the quality of the goods is good or bad. It is all in the hands of the supervisor. Generally speaking, no one will seriously pursue it. The training camp under the control of the Count of Goliath is not a good thing for the opposite branch. But ordinary defenders are very different from soul guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard took out the soul contract reel, there was no room for change. If you let Richard go back empty-handed, Schiller can be sure that after a few days, the knights under Gordon’s construction will kill, and there will be Mordred or Achilles in the air, let him escape. No escape. At the time, Schiller's best ending was to be killed on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller did not expect that Richard’s attitude would be so strong, and the situation would make him a no-recession. In fact, after Gordon successfully entered the floating world, the relationship between Goliath and Gotton has eased, and some tentative cooperation has begun. The selection of the soul guard for Richard from the death camp is one of the important contents of the cooperation between the two sides. However, Schiller still has a traditional attitude toward Richard and Lina to treat the people of Gordon. It is too self-contained, or the news is blocked, or for another reason, only he knows it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the secret order that Schiller originally received, he only tried to make him as difficult as possible, and did not ask him to hide people, but on the contrary, ultimately It is still necessary to pull out some of the best people who meet the conditions for Richard to pick, even if the other party has to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a somewhat contradictory order, but it just reflects the current relationship between Gordon and Goliath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siller's face changed indefinitely, and Richard did not urge him, and turned his eyes to the month of dyeing, so the pressure invisibly was even greater. Schiller finally made up his mind to return the soul contract reel to Richard, and softened his tone. He said, "I understand your needs. Please come with me. It is not too late, and we still need to travel a little longer." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller turned over and took Richard and Lina to the depths of the virgin forest. After running for nearly a hundred kilometers, I came to the stream of a mountain. There are several wooden houses scattered along the banks of the stream. In addition, there are several deep-bottomed openings on the mountain wall not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller pointed forward and said: "This is the real death training camp. The most talented fighters are coming out from here. Currently in the ten There are three people in the level that meet the requirements. I will summon them back now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded, so Schiller took out an iron whistle and forced one Blowing, sharp and bleak whistle immediately spread out, and a large group of nearby birds were stunned in the depths of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
