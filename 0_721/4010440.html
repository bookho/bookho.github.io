			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to Your Highness." The samurai leader said loudly, his expression was slightly excited, but he was It is very clear how valuable Hestin’s original soul is. What does this mean of “I’m trying to do it”, if it’s not for girls to fight side by side with them, every time they bring infinite vitality to their companions, this time is sacrificed. His own way saved too many robes, and the samurai leader could not make such a request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is her name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She just claims to be a silver wolf, we are all Call her like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Wolf, oh, very interesting name, I did smell the silver wolf on her." Ting waved his hand and said: "You should go out first. Let me first look at what her soul guardian power is. Also, remember to check if there are any special things in the body of the Dakso Das. If anything, Just send it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is that Hastings will have every request, so the warrior leader agreed, and he led his men to withdraw. The hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warriors left, Hastings put his hand on the girl’s forehead, and a faint green glow gradually appeared in his eyes. Under the mapping, the girl's body gradually became transparent, and the light spot representing the soul began to emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hestin suddenly snorted, his face was extremely surprised, and his heart turned over countless thoughts in a moment. "Awesome protection means, only Protection, this... This level is completely out of my mind, is Nolander still the master of this kind of soul, is it that one of the old guys is back, and so on... What is this... Oh, I understand, if it weren’t for this protection, this little wolf had already died, but now her soul is hurting enough, it’s tricky...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting's eyes are green and gazing, watching the girl who is sleeping, the look is quite complicated. After a while, he sighed and said to himself: "Oh, forget, who made me promise They are, this time it is a big loss, if you want to have to recuperate, I am afraid you have to use that thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the side of an ancient In front of the locker, remove a palm-sized clay pot from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pottery jar full of barbarian style, the work is quite rough, the color on the pattern has been mottled in many places, and the tank is not even a pure circle, as if the craftsman made casually defective products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things that are so shoddy, Hastings is very concerned, and looks very careful, he tears open the clay seal of the clay pot and thickens the turbid liquid inside. After a drink, he immediately took a nap, and actually spurted a black fire, and then Hasting's face had blood, and quickly rosy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage once again walked to the front of the magical stone platform, reached out and pressed on the stone platform, immediately ignited all the magic array, and then his eyes shot two The green light shines on the girl's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those two green beams, you can see that black spots of different sizes are thrown into the girl's body along the light beam. If the eyesight is good enough, It is possible to discern that the black spots turned out to be images of a creature, a beast, a strange race, and even some Dakso Das. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each image is put into the girl's body, it will be attracted by her soul light point, then the light point of the soul that is originally faint as a candle will become Brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every image is a piece of soul that Hastings stores and refines. These pieces of soul are his special source of blood power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is dark and gloomy, and the green light that passes from time to time seems to come from a different world of deep and endless places, and the atmosphere is horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the block area of ​​the Shing Mun area, it is a mess that has just ended in the war, and the broken stone wall street has fresh scars. There are countless such wounds in the city that has stood for thousands of years. Although it will be repaired, it can't be restored to no trace. So there is no layer of cracks in the weathering, so if there is a history without words. And now the two sides of the war have even crossed a civilization, making the content it displays become extraordinarily heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighborhood is very quiet, the noon team of Noland has not had time to clean up to the periphery, and the Dax Sodas have all evacuated, and will not be in the short term. Touch in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can find a small courtyard where an old man is leisurely curled up in a recliner, Lawrence is bathing in the long-lasting radiance, the battlefield The light is comparable to the sun, and the sun is warm on the body. It is good for some of his old injuries. For many years, it is rare to encounter a long-lasting glory. The old master naturally wants to use the benefits to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, there was a sudden and violent footstep outside the hospital. The people were obviously very anxious, but they stopped at the entrance of the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black and thin man looks through the broken door and looks at Lawrence, who is closing his eyes in the courtyard. His face immediately shows happiness. Cried, "Hid Royal Lawrence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid Royal Lawrence, the old man has not heard of this title for a long time, now the day is not falling, only one slap Those who can count the numbers will use this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lost honor, let Lawrence put up more than half of his bad temper, just lazily turned over, even his eyes did not open, so hold Say: "You should know that I don't like to be disturbed when I take a nap. It's a shame to waste such a good sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black skinny man Hesitated for a moment, or daringly, eagerly said: "His Royal Highness, these warriors have been very seriously injured. Today, the gods and gods are all used up, and two of them are seriously injured. No, now that the whole day is not over, you can only save them a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence listened, his beard curled up, immediately from the lounge chair I jumped up and cried, "Then you are still standing outside, don't hurry in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence directs everyone to put a few wounded Lifted into the yard, and then set up a few temporary tables, put the injured people, and began to examine the injuries for them one by one. Hey: "Hey, black boy, I still remember you. It was just to help you cure the wounds. You always respected me. You have some conscience, if you look at your face, these are The man is dead a hundred times, and it is impossible to disturb my nap. Long De Steader is stubborn and thinks that with Hasting, everything can be solved. If you want to be that year, if it is not me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumors of the legendary gossip, the black-skinned man naturally has nothing to plug in, just on the side of Nono, and the samurai are scattered around. Looking at Lawrence with awe, he cut his companion's chest softly, and his gestures were easy. It seemed that it was so easy to cut a steak at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence’s craft actually has a name, ** alchemy, only this name sounds like a sinister gas, and this is a more than alchemy The skill of the unpopular, although there are two words of alchemy, but in the strict sense, has been separated from the scope of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many kinds of sources about this skill. The most commonly used one is that ** alchemy is born out of alchemy, alchemy is on creation, and ** alchemy is on natural life, and therefore, inheriting this skill. Most are magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a warrior who sent the wounded person seemed to feel something, sniffing in the air, suddenly pulled out the sabre, cold channel: " Everyone is careful, there is the smell of the devil here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are ready to fight in an instant, even the wounded are clenched and able to touch The weapons that arrived, on the battlefield, everyone turned the battle into an instinct, at least part of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior who first discovered the clue suddenly turned around and crossed a wall that had already collapsed and rushed into the yard next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the residence of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too sudden, Lawrence just found out that Richard’s residence has already issued a series of dull explosions, and it’s obviously fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, that is Richard's residence." Lawrence screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first warrior responded with a deep voice: "There is a demon in the house of Master Richard. You can rest assured that I have a measure."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence finally sighed and said: "The devil is the prisoner of Richard, don't hurt him, come out, let me persuade him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior seemed to be a little stagnant, and then he jumped out of the room with his words. He bowed his body and stared at the young devil in front of him. The black scorpion also walked out of the room. However, he looked around and looked very nervous. Behind him, he also followed two other human powerhouses. Blackbird was forced out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term battle, both sides have added a lot of injuries, it can be seen that the black scorpion said that his combat power is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence saw this scene, and he sighed in his heart and said to the black scorpion: "You don't want to resist, yes, that's it, there won't be anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
