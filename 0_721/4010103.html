As long as there are reinforcements from the Sequoia Kingdom, try to stop the delay and try to delay the time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baton in the hands of Salenver constantly moves on the magic sandbox, and the markers of the one legion on the magic map move accordingly, leaving a strip on the sand table The track of the movement of the bar. Finally, Saranwell stared at the sand table, flashing his gaze in his eyes, using the baton to force a little in front of the plain in front of the Blood Flag Valley, saying: "Wait Richard arrives in the Blood Valley, I will lead the Imperial Seventh and Eighth Legion, and the three Knights, and go straight to the Plain of the Plains, where they will fight with Richard! The entire march takes two days, so Sir Albert Your duties are great. As long as you block Richard for three days, my army will be able to swallow Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Sir is a strong master And the middle-aged man who is silent and whispered, only heard a sentence: "There must be no mission!" There is no other unnecessary words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sarenwell knew his character and used his fist to slap on the jazz-like hard chest and said, "Good! Let Richard Try the Imperial Iron Wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of arms, it seems ridiculous to want to use the light force to block the elite of Richard's ride. More than a dozen aristocrats and a number of generals in the conference room took it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Jazz is one of the empire's famous philosophers. He is very good at defense. If it is not dragged down by his mother who was born in slavery, Alha is now a viscount. But everyone agrees that in the lifetime of Sir Albert, the rise of the merits to the Baron is a matter of nailing. Finally, Sharwell stared at the plain of the bones and suddenly smiled. He said to himself: "The 30,000 army is against you, Richard, I'm going to take a look at this, how are you going to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference room, most people are puzzled, and finally an Earl asks "Adult, Richard is just a little pioneering knight. Is it worth your effort? In fact, if you are in a stalemate between Li Shilongtu and the dragons, why not follow your original plan and put there? The annexation of several independent nobles? This is a more striking contribution, and the impact on His Majesty is even more pronounced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This count is very reasonable, Salen Will's outstanding leadership is his greatest reliance on the throne. However, the ability to lead is not just to say, but also to have a tangible record. However, in the past year, Saranwell’s record has not been dazzling, and the leader of the coalition’s escaping invader Sinclair has been defeated. As a result, Sinclair was wiped out by a small baron of the Sequoia Kingdom. This is tantamount to a loud slap in the face of Salenwell! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the iron triangle empire rumors, the other emperors seized the opportunity to attack the incompetence of Saranwell in front of the emperor. Fortunately, Saranwell has a past record as a support, and Li Shilongtu accidentally ate a few defeats under the dragon's men, and the emperor retained the power of Salenwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, for more than half a year, Saranwell was busy expanding his strength, training his team, and constantly trying to find more support from the nobility. For the purpose of investment, many nobles did not make a man, but they supported him a lot of military expenses. Salenville immediately exchanged a large amount of gold coins for warriors, equipment, and training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having been squatting for half a year, the actual number of soldiers under the army has doubled, and the increase in combat effectiveness is also very small. This force, originally prepared to point to the East, annexed a series of small countries and independent nobles, and then penetrated the Andes Promenade, extending the territory of the Empire to the Whale Bay, thus gaining a significant seaport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, after hearing the Richard’s line plan, Salenville immediately changed the original plan, but prepared to take full advantage and blood in one fell swoop. The land annihilates Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what good is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is almost obscure, his title is only jazz, and the title of pioneering the Cavaliers itself represents a war nouveau rich. Even though Richard has a little history in the Sequoia Kingdom, in the eyes of the Imperial generals, the kingdom is a little stronger than the independent aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the blood-stained land, it is more complicated and barren, the terrain is complex, and it is a natural warland with many national forces. It is hard to say how much value the empire can get there, but the subsequent maintenance costs are visible and some buffers are lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone, this is a war that is costly as long as it is opened, and it is not good to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville looked at the faces of the people around him, and most of them saw no doubts and doubts. On the surface, this is a war that is not worth the candle, but in the heart of Allenville, the original number of incredible figures emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand eight hundred to three hundred and ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the battle-to-loss ratio that has been so painstaking for Salenwell. Even facing the fiasco of the devil-like Sinclair, he was not impressed by this number. After all, he knew the reasons for the failure of Sinclair and was confident that under certain conditions, he could not reverse the situation. Richard is different. A group of barbarians and samurai knights who are arrogant people can play such incredible results under Richard. What if such a person masters the army? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after hearing the line-up plan, Salenwell finally made up his mind to turn the wing and defeat the Richard with absolute superiority! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone." The voice of Salenwell was serious and low, and he said with unprecedented dignity: "If you don't want to destroy Richard now, he will become an empire in the future." The enemy! Compared with the safety of the empire, my personal merits are nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have never seen such a seriousness of Salenwell, Amazed. They followed Saranwell, not only because of the brilliant title of his prince, genius strategic commander, and great magician. Saranwell’s far-sighted view of the overall situation has always been convinced. Although they all admit that the Sequoia Kingdom’s long-term plan is not a good thing for the iron triangle empire that is close to it, the empire can also be disturbed at the right time, but Saranwell even mentions this to such a The height of the species was unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the strength of Marquis Yang is thoughtful, the red Cossack belonging to him recently suffered heavy losses in the blood-stained place, and the core strength was eliminated by more than one-third. Loss of millions of coins. Through these figures, Yang can also understand the scarcity of some of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A storm is forming in the country of the North, ready to pounce on the bloody land, tearing up Richard in one fell swoop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was still ignorant of the storm that was brewing in the north, just lying quietly on the bed, staring at the top of the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his consciousness, there is a very detailed map covering the entire blood-stained area and surrounding areas. On the map, the rolling soldiers are starting from the blue water oasis, all the way like a broken bamboo, destroying all obstacles in front, reaching the pale highlands. On the way to the march, various forces flocked to this army, but none of them met before the iron flow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is deducting the entire campaign in consciousness, the most important of which is the torrent of four soldiers from the Iron Triangle Empire, representing the possibility of the Iron Triangle Empire. Four intervention routes. The name of Allenville has the name of Allenville. As the Iron Triangle Empire is smashed, the name of Salenwell is also marked with a striking red cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips of Richard’s lips were chilled and whispered, “Sirrenville, if you dare to come, don’t think about going back. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the magic clock points to ten o'clock at night, and Richard jumps out of bed and walks out of the camp. He made several orders in his consciousness, and the side door of the barracks was opened. The team of the troops belonging to Richard left the camp and quietly went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the mixed forces of Heim and the Duke of the Wolf also left the military camp in the night, not knowing where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By eleven o'clock, only a few thousand infantry belonging to the outer aristocracy were left in the camp. At this time, it was essentially equal to the aristocrats and generals who were overheads were invited by Richard to the Chinese army's big account. Here, a rich banquet was prepared, saying that they should stay up all night. Richard did not know where to go, where the Viscount Heim took the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the Richards, and all the followers who belonged to him disappeared, it is impossible to win over these generals. They all know that Richard must act, but no matter what action, as long as they don't use them on the battlefield, it is always good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the nobility or the general, no matter how old or young, drinking and staying up late is always proficient, so he quickly enters the state, and the camp is a joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the magic clock is near midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Camp is a silence, full of the dignity of the rain. Except for the footsteps of the patrol fighters, almost no other sounds were heard. Occasionally, the long horse of a horse can also travel far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, a few rides of light horses are going straight to the blue camp. They are reconnaissance cavalry patrolling around the camp. Now it is time to shift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a small slope, the lights of the camp are far away, and with the thought of spirits and warm beds, several cavalrymen could not help but excite them and speed up the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a sharp arrow was shot in the grass not far away! The cavalry, who was headed, should drop his arrow and fail to make a slight noise. The war horse who lost his master also fell to the ground, and the long arrow feather blocked the humming. Then Lei Arrow continued to shoot from the darkness and shot all the reconnaissance cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack came so suddenly, when all the cavalry fell, only one person had time to make a short and faint scream. However, it is certainly not within the camp two kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, get out of a team of fighters. They lined up neatly, and by the cover of the night, they drew close to the distance of the blue camp, and then sat down in rows and began to eat to replenish their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
