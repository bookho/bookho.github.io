			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, deep blue is quite safe, especially the main tower range. After all, people like Stevenson are a minority. If you dare to take risks, you will be a hero. If you are unsuccessful, you will become a man. However, after all, he still lived well in the dark blue, and his forces have increased. In order to ensure the victory of the game, the Duke of Soram sent a lot of people. This gray dwarf has some regrets and insisted on leaving the Dragon Warlock. Now that the mountains and the sea are intimate with Richard, Stevenson and even Richard dare to assassinate, and the mountains and the sea cannot be said to ensure safety. After all, if a person loses his mind, he will not consider the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf is convinced that the mountains and the sea are killing. Those who can accumulate such wealth, regardless of race or young age, regardless of the path, have great luck and are favored by God. And Stevenson is a typical example of the opposite. So Black Gold is not worried about the dangers of life in the mountains and the sea, just worried that she will be harassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gray dwarfs were in dire straits, they finally broke their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over there, Stevenson suddenly discovered that as long as he left the residential area, he would inevitably encircle four law enforcement mages and two stepping knights. Its name is protected. Even in class, they are also inseparable from Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of message dissemination in Deep Blue is quite fast. The mountain and the sea only followed Lee for two days, and everyone knew her identity and the ‘background’. And her unique name is no longer a joke, at least no one dares to talk face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is like this day, the time is getting closer and closer. During this period, the Grey Dwarf privately met with Richard and talked with him once. The Grey Dwarf first described the hardships of Su Helun, indicating that her wealth was hard to come by. Next, the euphemism showed that the ‘Su Helun’s joy’ that Richard had suffered was unprecedented, and then the dark blue financial situation was in jeopardy. In the gray dwarf population, Deep Blue will break up the retail sale tomorrow to pay off the heavy debts. Just as Richard heard a heavy and dark mood and began to think about whether he could do something for the teacher, the gray dwarf turned his voice and the tone increased by 16 degrees. He told the savior that the rescue of the deep blue has appeared in an aria. It is the mountain and the sea. Finally, the gray dwarf jumped to the coffee table in front of Richard, looking at his eyes, telling Richard the greatest sincerity and heavyness in his life, and now returning to Su Hailun The moment has arrived, that is to accompany the mountains and the sea, in order to let her stay in the dark blue for a while, because the first phase of the girl only ordered a month of courses, and the next time the class is about to come. In addition, the gray dwarf also hinted that Richard, as far as possible to meet all the requirements of the girl, for example, some kind of 'small gift' may wish to send more points, anyway, there will be no less meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, wondering how many magical eyes the gray dwarf had in his living area, in the end, the gray dwarf said that as long as Richard Ken contributed Then the gray dwarf will not forget his, winning the game is not a problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left the gray dwarf's office, Richard's mood became heavy and gloomy. He said that he couldn't understand the feeling in his heart. He only felt that there was a clear relationship between the mountains and the sea, and it was mixed with many turbid muds. As for the promise of Black Gold, Richard has forgotten it when he took the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, the mountain and the sea after the meal received her ‘small gift’, and the process went quite smoothly. Of course, if Richard fully resists, then the result is that the process of collecting gifts has become 'very smooth' from ‘quite smoothly’, and there is no essential difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The satisfied girl was keenly aware of the gloom of Richard's eyebrows, so she asked with concern: "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you tell me?" The mountain and the sea held their chins with both hands and looked forward to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee shook his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl snorted, quieted down, standing silently beside Richard, watching him start designing a new magic pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is so quiet, the days of the game are getting closer. The period between the mountains and the sea in the dark blue has exceeded the predetermined one month, but there is no sign of leaving. Every time the girl stays in the dark blue for a day, the gray dwarf will have a big impact on Richard. Because every time she stays for one day, it means a lot of tuition and living expenses, which means that the deep blue financial statements are better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Richard can wait quietly until the game day is coming, but the world is always full of coincidences. On a certain day of class, Richard met with Stevenson. This kind of opportunity is really rare. After the game is released, whether it is intentional or not, the two have never taken the same course, and the gray dwarf Careful and careful, naturally, will not give them the opportunity to attend public classes together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard again, the face of the Dragon Warlock changed immediately, and the heart that thought he could calmly calmed up again. He immediately took Minnie and quietly stood in the direction of Richard's progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Warlock's confidence this time is not from his own hands, but behind the four law enforcement mages and two stepping knights. He already understands that this is the manpower of the Black Gold to control and monitor, but more than one person has mistakenly thought that this is the symbol of the advancement of the Dragon Warlock in the Dark Blue. Even the big magician travels, you don't need this level of guard! Therefore, the Dragon Warlock is determined to use this misunderstanding to force Richard to detour. In fact, he himself knows that this practice does not make any sense, but it is good to be able to temporarily suppress Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Dragon Warlock stood in the middle of the road, but had not had time to speak, but suddenly felt that the gas field behind him was a bit thin. He hurriedly looked back and found that all the law enforcement mages and step knights stayed in the same place, completely did not follow up, and their eyes were all focused on the girl next to Richard. The Dragon Vessels had a bad feeling and immediately looked at the girl. In a moment, she remembered the identity of the mountain and the sea, especially when she and the midsummer night of the carnival night overlapped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard looked up and his eyes fell on the Dragon Warlock's body, and his eyebrows were slightly wrinkled. Richard did not fear Stevenson, but it was a little strange why his face changed so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Richard to react, Stevenson suddenly made a big step, dragging Minnie to the other side of the road, and not squinting, like It was originally going through the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After standing on the opposite side of the road, Stevenson turned back and pretended to look at Richard. His focus is very particular, and he has never touched the mountains and the sea. It was only for the Duke of Soram to provoke a Richard. After that, Gordon had not yet begun his 13th Cavaliers expedition that shocked the mainland, but if he provoked a thousand-year dynasty, then Sidvinson would not know. How to end it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked awkward and was stunned by a series of weird moves by Stevenson. He thought for a whole minute until his gaze Inadvertently sweeping the mountains and the sea around me, I can understand what the Dragon Warlock really wants to do. But when Richard reacted, the rare Dickson had already disappeared into the corner of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
