			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Archimonde makes the right response, those behind the scenes will naturally retreat, and as compensation, they will do the same. Will be introduced as a victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Qi Geju has disappeared. By convention, Zieg’s family has officially apologized and doubled the compensation for Archimonde’s losses. It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Archimonde’s response is not normal, then it is possible to incur war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever such temptations appear, it actually means that the situation is on the verge of danger. Just as the beast is attacking, he always uses his claws to test the reaction of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in front of Richard personally came to the House of Lords, this reaction can be said to be overdone. But a few really sensitive people, instinctively feel that things should not be so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The missing goods are this." Said, Richard took a double-tube Raytheon from the night elf and slammed into the dome of the House of Lords. A shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderous roar suddenly made the aristocrats panic, the screams came one after another, the beautifully decorated dome was opened with a big hole, the gravel was raining, 砸On the head of the nobility below. Although it did not cause any harm, it caused a new wave of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a slight order in the conference hall. People looked at the thunder in the hands of Richard with fear and looked at the huge breach on the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroying the building of the House of Lords is itself a crime and not a light one. But at this moment, no aristocrat is stupid enough to come to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw it very clearly, Raytheon was double-tube, and Richard had just fired a shot. Richard’s gun has already indicated his attitude. At this time, whoever jumps out is looking for death. Maybe the next shot is aimed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold voice of Richard rang again: "Acmemond is in a special period, so I will not control the unspoken rules of your shit! I have my Rules! Now I am announcing the handling of this incident, I hope that those who still want to make my mind will listen carefully. I declare that I will be sentenced to death, and he will be hunted forever, aligning with the head of the plaid. The bounty is one million gold coins, and all the families that have hidden the plaques are annihilated. The family of Qigejue will be exiled and the territory will be incorporated into Archimonde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When the decision came out, the scene suddenly disappeared. Some people with a heart are pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of Richard was not over-excited, but completely overstepped the bottom line of the nobility, and thoroughly trampled on the unspoken rules that have been established for thousands of years. If you can't stop Richard, then those behind the scenes will find it hard to find a scapegoat to dare to test Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles are thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zig is really unlucky, he thought it was a batch of ordinary goods, but I did not expect it would be a double-tube Raytheon! Such a powerful killer will surely play an important role in Archimonde's war against the Reaper. It is no wonder that Richard will be so angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, it is found that this level of strategic material is stolen, then you should immediately find a way to return the release, so that the contradiction will not be over-intensified. However, from the reaction of Richard, it is obvious that some people have taken a fancy to this batch of things, or they have forcibly taken away most of them. This kind of thing can be complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others think more deeply. They all know that Faro is a plane with high time velocity. When the Raytheon is one day late, the reaper is likely to kill hundreds of Archimonde fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a young nobleman stood up and shouted: "What rights do you have to dispose of a Viscount?!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Lei, the thunder took a turn, and the muzzle suddenly spurted out the fire. In the roar, most of the body of this young aristocrat suddenly disappeared and became a bloody fog. Only one foot flew up. At high altitude, after rolling for dozens of times, I broke into the crowd. People panicked, but surprisingly no one dared to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in a low voice: "Every time I stand here for a minute, there may be several Archimonde fighters who die. I came. Here, it’s not to listen to your doubts, just to announce the decision. No one has the right to question my decision!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee throws Thunder back to that Night Elf Warrior. The night elf skillfully filled Raytheon with new projectiles and then stared at the aristocrats in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles suddenly found out that Richard’s words did not seem to have been finished, so they were all inexplicably cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the meeting room was a little quieter, Richard continued: "The direct planning of this incident is Yaya Turan. Another indirect ambassador is Wells Heatings. These two people will also be Execution, their immediate family members will be destroyed. The Turan family has an hour to hand over the person, otherwise the consequences will be conceited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is shouting One voice: "You are provoking the Turan family! Do you want war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stretched out his hand, a middle-aged aristocrat immediately from the crowd Flying out, can't help but hang in the air. His face was pale, bound by magical power, and he couldn't even speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look at him at all, but looked at all the nobles in the House of Lords and said slowly: "Similar provocation, I don't want to See the second time. Any family that challenges Archimonde must be prepared to kill the family. If you want war, then I will also give you war. Even if Archimonde is dead, I am left alone. I will also kill all the enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is soothing and calm, no roaring, no hysteria. But his declaration is true and direct. It was because of this calm that everyone felt the determination of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps until this moment, many talents will truly let go of arrogance and prejudice and seriously think about how to treat Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard's Archimonde is still rising too fast, beyond the limits of people's imagination, so that people are always subconsciously unwilling to accept this reality. They may not dare to face Archimonde directly, but they always want to have a long-standing power to come out and wipe out Archimonde from Noland's territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Richard issued the war declaration, many talents realized that Richard was already a super strong. Not only did he have the qualification to stand alone, but he also naturally had the power to kill a giant. If there are no superpowers in the family, then no one can resist the assassination of a superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, who is the first to trample on the unspoken rules? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard went to the gate of the House of the House, a night elf raised the thunder, aimed at the middle-aged aristocrat who was still tied in the air, and pulled the trigger . After a roar, the middle-aged aristocrat became a broken meat limb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten night elves followed Li, and they left the venue. This time, no one is finally stupid enough to jump out and say something. Richard has told them two examples that anyone who dares to question him at this time will be killed mercilessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already atrocities. However, Richard clearly has made up his mind to use blood and force to shut up these boring aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate will never solve the problem, and the power can solve the problem. Whether it is malicious, with ulterior motives, or unintentional, as long as you dare to be in this position, you will be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the floating island, Richard summoned representatives of several major gray organizations and issued a killing order for Wells Heatings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reward for live capture is five million, and the bounty for the head is two million. All family members of Wells also set bounty according to their bloodliness and importance. Wells is the nephew of Heitings, and he is deeply loved by Heinness. But the scope of these gray organizations covers the entire continent, not how to fear Heitings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four killer organizations that have received the bounty. The other two smaller organizations need to go back and study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich is now very valuable in any of the strong hands, it is impossible for lang fees to be spent on such time-consuming and laborious pursuits. It is best if they are executed by these killer organizations. Unless there are big giants who are sheltering them, these people can be said to be dead with such a high reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the major killer organizations are still ten minutes away from the Turan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris seized the gap and sent in a new plan. This is a plan to adjust the circulation of Akmon's materials, and it is ready to change all the materials related to Raytheon to air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the new double-tube Raytheon cost is much lower than the six-tube Raytheon. Their real bottleneck is the projectile filled with power metal. The power metal is currently only available from the reaper, and only the Archimonde family, who swears to die with the reaper, will produce a lot. The value of such a projectile will exceed that of Thor itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Thunder will be shipped to Ashan by the cargo team. There are only a very small amount of ammunition in the car, and a really large amount of ammunition is transported by air to the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
