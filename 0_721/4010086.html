			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragon is a Luofu never heard of The gods, its requirements for faith are incomparably simple, as long as the believers are willing to find items with powerful power attributes to sacrifice to it, there is such a sincere wish. The so-called "good faith" is just to recite its name, and promises to do its best to complete a sacrifice in the year of life. In other words, as long as you try your best, it is not important whether you can actually complete the sacrifice. Of course, the sacrifice will definitely have more benefits. Because the faith statement says that after the sacrifice, the earned grace will give the sacrificer more rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter of principle of faith, in which God does not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that the third layer of the start of the war 傀儡 reel is so close! Luofu knows that as long as he has a thought, he can reach the standard of faith. The only price seems to be disgusted by the gods of this plane, and it is impossible to become their followers in the future. But the family that Luofu was born to worship of the ancestors was not happy with the gods, and the cost was almost negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the separation of Luofu and Richard, on the way back to the residence, the war in the arms seemed to be beating. As long as there is a third layer of assistance, Luofu has the confidence to kill any one of Chuck or Tutu. Even if they meet both of them at the same time, Luo Fu can completely get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luofu’s eyes are getting darker and darker when he thinks that he lost his hand and was humiliated. He has always wanted to see the heads of these two people, not to mention that their heads can now be exchanged for 300,000 bounty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bounty, even Luofu is heart-warming. A veteran sanctuary, who wants to get this wealth, also needs to struggle for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already sown the seeds, just waiting for it to break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard obtained a lot of plots next to the station at a very low price, and expanded his camp area by five times. This will accommodate more buildings and more fighters. A small obstacle encountered in the process of merger, has been solved in an instant, and even did not reach Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equipment he purchased was also arrived. Such a large-volume order almost evacuated the inventory of Jinhui Battle Flag and several large commercial banks nearby. Most of the weapons and armor were quietly sent by Richard to the edge of the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a few more days, when all the knights brought out of the family were integrated into the army and initially familiarized, Richard chose an early morning. Convene the troops and leave the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich did not go to the red Cossacks caravan as many people expected, but embarked on the road to return to the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always feels that the guys who are entrenched in Baron Xiaofang Dan are a threat, such as the thorns in the back, so you must first clean up this one that does not know when it will break out. Delay the fireball. Moreover, since Richard has guessed that there may be huge profits behind this, of course, knowing that the longer the time is dragged, the greater the loss of the other party will be, and the more malicious it will be, the more it will be the first mover, and it will inevitably fall into a passive situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the blue water oasis and re-walking on the red land of the blood-stained land, Richard felt that the whole person had relaxed. Moreover, in the consciousness, the soul nodes are constantly lit, which is like the feeling of expansion of consciousness, and it is also fascinating. The world of Richard was a few times wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashes, mother nests, followers, and the elite bats flying in the sky are the eyes of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Head, how are you going to fight this time?" Gangde walked on the side of Richard's horse and ran like a wind, asking loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in an understatement: "hard hit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s eyes are bright, 吼It’s up: “Good! I like it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Gangde is no longer the usual light-red upper body, the high quality enlightened armor brought by Richard The film ordered a scale for him. The weight is only half of the plate, but the defensive power is double that of the standard body plate. The hand shield used by the ordinary warrior was directly attached to his shoulder and turned into a shoulder armor. Richard gave him a second-order defense. Therefore, now Gangde is completely a steel fortress. When launching the power of the earth and inspiring the power, it can even face the heavy-loaded knight who is running at full speed with the elite knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusk castle of Baron Xiaofang Dan, Sir Odom suddenly stood up and grabbed the soldier in front of him, shouting: "What do you say? Richard Did the little miscellaneous/species appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderous snoring resounded throughout the living room, and several antique bottles on the flower stand shattered, porcelain The film fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior was stunned by Odom’s big hand, almost breathless, where can he still say half a word? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Latour, who is sitting opposite, persuaded: "If you go on like this, you will kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom was squirting, and some unwillingly let go of the big hand, the soldier was able to finish Richard’s whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Odom’s skin is dark, with a steel-like short whisker, a deep dark red and heavy armor, and the protruding thorns make the heavy armor extraordinarily ferocious. He strode to the door and smashed a commander and shouted in a thunderous voice: "Go and let all the cavalry gather! Then go to the belly of the woman and the damn priests from the woman's belly." Get it up and tell them to start on time in an hour!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Latour was taken aback and said, "Odom, this is too urgent. Click on it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 70-kilometer road, it ran in two hours." Odom looked disapproving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Sir Hogan advised: "If you leave for an hour, you don't have time to bring the necessary supplies. In addition, if you want to run the full course in two hours, All the infantry can't keep up. Most of the wizards and pastors can't adapt to this speed, and they will definitely fall behind! The lack of pastors and mages is likely to be risky. That Richard is not a general embarrassment. He disappeared. For a long time, this time suddenly appeared, and there was mostly a conspiracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom sneered: "Conspiracy? With that six or seven hundred troops, there are more than half Infantry, can you have any conspiracy? Old man, you are telling me, this is the force for you, how are you going to eat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Huo The roots and eyebrows are tightly locked, and the wrinkles on the face are as deep as a knife. They have to say: "He showed us six hundred people, but it does not mean only six hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Odom screamed, interrupting Old Hogan's words, and then rudely poked his old Hogan's chest with his fingers, snarling. "Clarify your identity, the old man! Here I am the highest commander, let you do what you do, don't talk so much nonsense. Don't think that only you know how to lead troops, my record is much better than you." When you start killing, you are just a public!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Hogan’s face changed dramatically. In a similar dispute, his original civilian identity was always a stabbing thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man! Bring your infantry, speed up to follow. In addition, if you see which mage or pastor master is on the road, take care of them. It’s good to be a part of your life!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom is like a black god of war, with a madness rolled out of the lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odom, wait, we can discuss it again!" Earl Latu called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for? I have been suffocating in this castle. Now I see the baroness's fart/strands want to vomit!" Odom’s voice went all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Latour came to the old Hogan, patted him on the shoulder, sighed and said, "You don't go to the heart, he is like this." One person. We have seven hundred elite cavalry, and Odom’s escorts are all heavy. It’s not a problem to deal with Richard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Huo The root shook his head and said, "Don't forget, how did the two hundred eagle-flag knights die in the hands of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latu's face Also passed a shadow. Until now, it is still a mystery. But they have been here for more than three months and things have not progressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf did not know if he was aware of anything. He said that he was going to recuperate after the war and could not close his door. Regardless of whether they went to the territory of Richard to plunder, or pretend to be lost, they invaded the territory of another vassal of the Duke, and the Duke did not care. The viscount, who was bordered by Richard, did not go to the Duke’s complaint. Instead, he made things go to the court and finally closed the case with robbery. Two eagle-flag knights were sent to jail as robbers, leaving them with a laughing stock in the aristocratic society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Richard has finally appeared, it may be a way for Odom to go first. The Count of Latour couldn't help but press the forehead. The whole fact was that it was too bad to touch all the way, and everything was because of the pioneering knight who didn't know where to drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, Odom rode a huge black horse and led the seven hundred knights to embark on the journey. Dozens of riding light cavalry were thrown out and scouted to determine the position of the Richards. Odom led the army and ran without it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a trot, but not prepared enough in advance, it’s a very hard thing to march for two hours. It took only a dozen minutes for the more than a dozen mages and priests in the middle of the team to start showing signs of discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom did not care, and did not mean to slow down the team. Richards are just some of the eleventh-level guys, most of them are infantry, and the cavalry is all made up of the sandman knights. Recently, I heard that a group of soldiers named Guns of the Devils joined the team of Richard, but in the eyes of the military aristocrats, the horses and the mercenaries are of the same nature, a group of hooligans, how can they be led by Odom. Are the regular knights in the same league? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom is also quite familiar with the blood-stained land. He used to have thirty guardian knights, killing more than four hundred horses and blood flowing into the river. The fighting power of the Shamin cavalry is not even as good as the horse, how can it be placed in his eyes! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the detective that had gone out to explore had already discovered the camp of Richard. This discovery made Odom wary, if the action is fast, after the fight, I have time to rush back to the dusk castle for dinner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
