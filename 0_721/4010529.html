It has limited effect on all the knights composed of elites. There are only sporadic arrows on the wall to fight back. They just shot a few knights. The extremely tenacious knight of the squadron climbed up and continued to attack the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights have arrived at the city wall, they instigated the magic ride, to enhance the riding power with vindictiveness, the magic rides leaped, the iron hoof with special structure on the wall As soon as I stepped on, I was on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderous roar in the city of Toble, a Sanctuary strongman ascends to the air, holding a giant sword burning with flames, prestige Just like the gods and gods, this sacred strongman’s eyes swept away, and his face suddenly changed. The number of strong people flying in the air by Richard’s side was so high that he was chilling. He had not thought of the way to step down. The seven-color radiance shines, and a large spear throws a ray of light and is bursting into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of knights have finally seen a strong man who dares to fly into the sky. They are all overjoyed, and their throwing spears are hungry for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary strong screamed, his heart was cracked, and he immediately ran wildly, and there were more than a hundred throwing spears chasing him behind him. From this point of view, his treatment is indeed higher than the legendary Dragon Star. He understands why the strong people of the party are afraid to take off. It is not timid, but the enemy’s knight. Too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city defense army was quickly disbanded, and the city gate of Toble City was also opened by the ten tons of Tiramisu. Into the city, guided by the elite bats flying in the sky, rolling toward the Great Temple of St. Louis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple has been built with simple fortifications, and the Knights of the Temple are standing behind the fortifications, guarding the priests behind them with heavy shields and their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw it and nodded slightly, saying: "They actually gave up the war horse. It seems that the guy inside is either very simple or stupid." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea next to it said: "My father said, never despise your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"No, there will be no stupid guys in the Church of St. Hui, otherwise they will not develop to this level today," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and the knights immediately raised the rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare...attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s hand swaying, one The team's squadron knight got the order and rushed to the temple. A wave of powerful smashing arrows struck, and immediately shot the smashing knight who rushed to the forefront. The follow-up squadron knights stepped on the bodies of their companions and struggled to overcome the fortifications. , strangled with the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple are well-equipped and well-trained, and the body is constantly shining with the brilliance of the Holy White. It is a sign of blessing, and here is the Great St. Louis Temple. Here, the knights of the battle gods have their own home court advantage, and a large number of priests and priests give them blessings and healing the wounds. These are the strengths of the knights, and they are hard to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate of the temple, the Bishop of Richelieu and Martin are standing on the top of the high-level, overlooking the battlefield below, and there are only two people around them at the moment. Guarded, the others were sent to the front line of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop continued to cast a magical spell while saying: "This is the land of saints' martyrdom. Our knights should have obvious advantages, if their number is not So few words..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinus shook his head and said, "That's not necessarily, you see the cooperation between the Cavaliers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Frontiers are extremely compact and acquainted with each other. They often kill four or five people and kill a Knight of the Temple. The attacking parts are different. If there were a large number of pastors who were constantly treated with magical techniques to save people, the Knights of the Temple had long suffered heavy losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is still casting magical skills, it has time to observe the cooperation between the knights and the knights, the battle has not yet begun, the speed of the Knights of the Knights is injured. Apparently speeding up, the attack of the Knights of the Frontier is more targeted, the situation is rapidly deteriorating, and the bishop is shocked and angry, desperately casting the magic, and can't even say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin also glimpsed a little, muttering to himself: "No, this is impossible, it is the God of War, and it is impossible to train the army to this extent." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard also commanded a thousand knights to kill in front, but it was a lot easier than in the past. The thinker, that is, the brain of the mother's nest, was already connected with Richard's consciousness. Sharing most of his command work, with the help of thinkers, the number of concurrently directed by Richard can rise from more than 100 to more than 300. In a large-scale war, it means that Richard can fully exert his commanding ability. The size of the force has also tripled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha dispatched a thousand knights, and the Knights of the Temple only had three hundred, but the Knights of the Shrine had less than ten casualties at the moment, and the Knights of the Front had already fought. More than 30 people died, but Richard knows that it is only a superficial phenomenon. As long as the gods of the gods stop, the Knights of the Temple will be defeated immediately. The gods are always limited. Now many young pastors are I have already finished my high-level magic, still trying to squeeze my physical strength and divine power, and cast the tiniest treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it be so smooth, Richard intuitively won’t be so simple, his eyes swept over the battlefield, and finally stayed on the bishop and Martin, when he saw Martin, Richard glimpsed a little, feeling as if he had seen this handsome young man, but Martin’s appearance is very obvious. His smile full of warmth and sunshine is the biggest feature. If Richard saw it in the past, Will not forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that something was not quite right, and he took advantage of the insight to look at Martin, but at the end of his sight was a very strong light, and he stabbed Richard’s eyes. Swelling, Li is shocked, and insight can only fail in a very small number of real strong people, or those with strong special abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately pointed to Martin and said, "Be careful of that guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shrine At the gate, Martin stunned and then laughed and said to the bishop: "It seems that my identity may be seen by him. If this is the case, let me see how much he is going to pay for the St. Louis Temple. The price is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is also a glimpse, this battle is about to collapse, he has prepared for the martyrdom, but the meaning of Martin’s words is still There is a means of turning over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin opened the holy book and turned to one of the pages, whispering: "...the Emoyan are being tortured by disease and hunger. And fighting the heresy clan, they prayed to the Lord, and the Lord responded, and promised to give them a god-given, Emoyan prophet to ask for the army, they thought that the elimination of heresy is more important, so the Lord gave them the knight ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's voice echoed in the temple, soft and sweet. He read a section of the church's shining sacred scriptures. Not only did the oracles know that many devout believers can bear it, even Richard knows that Richard This trip, but specially studied a lot of sacred churches, the Holy Scriptures are naturally the top priority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is the use of reading the Holy Scriptures at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Martin’s voice gradually spread, a large ray of light suddenly appeared in the corner of the square in front of the shrine, and there was a near-hundred ride in the Holy Light. The White Knight is also higher than the first-order Silver Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the Holy White Knight of the 15th level or above can be promoted to become the Silver Knight, and there are so many Silver Knights popping up next to him, let Richard also Surprised, this is a force that can reverse the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tiramisu, stop them." Richard made a judgment in an instant, only the powerful ogre lord was able to block the silver of the established system. knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me, head." Tiramisu cried, pulling before the Silver Knight, ten tons of swaying, smashing In the forefront of the Yinhui Knights even took the horse to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness of Richard, hundreds of orders were issued in an instant, and the three hundred squadrons were interspersed with a dazzling maneuver, just behind the ogre. It was listed as a neat and intensive line of defense. It stopped the charge of the Yinhui Knight. The knight who had been standing still was inserted from the two wings and surrounded the Yinhui Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was relieved, and he was glad that he did not send all the knights out. Otherwise, he would be passive now, but his mind immediately raised doubts. These silver-colored knights came out from there. There was no sign of mass transmission. They were not illusions. They only knew the spears and wounds that were pulled in the tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still didn’t want to understand, and Martin’s voice was heard in his ear: “...the Lord later gave the warrior, the sword-bearer, There are also spear holders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large ray of light in the corner of the square. After the light is scattered, hundreds of high-level churches appear. Warriors, they have swords, heavy shields, and spears. Although these high-ranking Templars have only 12 orders, they are numerous, and the fate is that they happen to appear behind Richard. At the time, most of Richard’s troops were transferred to kill the Yinhui Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
