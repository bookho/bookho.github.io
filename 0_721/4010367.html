			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the 'eight-day war', Annan, who should have been the protagonist And the Schumpeter family has become bleak, only after the nobles talked about Richard and Mensa, they will pay attention to where the Anan family’s army is hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to fait is never flat, even if the Schumpeter family has been beaten, this is also true, when Dupont Anan finally looked up When the city of miracles was floating in the world, the Anan family had a total of 6,000 soldiers permanently sleeping on the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the Schumpeter family has been decided. According to tradition, they still have a month to transfer to the floating island. One month later, all the bears will Have to leave and give the floating island to the new Annan family of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the floating island of 7-7, at this time, the clouds were overcast, and all the people were rushing in and out, not willing to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Schumpeter sat in his lavish study and stared at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a master's mural "The Day of the City Breaking" on the ceiling, but the bloody and miserable scene on the picture is so dazzling, even the former Duke Satisfied with a picture of a young girl being picked up by several armed soldiers, it is hard to make him excited at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of a girl is white and dazzling, it seems that the whole world is shaking in uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving away from the floating island is not the end, but the beginning, the beginning of a tragic fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, the Bear Peter family will need to sacrifice through other floating island giants. They are still weak and have to cope with the past and present countless enemies like wolves. One of these enemies is particularly frightening, and that is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Eighth Day War, Richard once again saw the other side of his own unknown, and now, it seems that only Richard is left behind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bear Peter family still has some strong players. Under this situation, only the strong covenant relationship will never be ordered to assassinate Richard. There are only family blood relatives, the legend of the far-field battlefield, even the Duke of Peter Peter, who has not heard of his uncle's ancestors for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the time flow rate of the absolute battlefield, this legendary strongman may have turned into a dead bone at this moment. Even if he is still alive and returns in time, he will dare to do something about Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a legendary strongman shot on Richard, it would definitely bring out Su Hailun, the moody imperial court who can occupy the name of the Guardian of the Holy Alliance. Naturally, there is strength that matches its hegemonic style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time in recent days, the Duke of Peter Peter began to seriously consider the fate and future of the family, according to his violent personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard was reorganizing the army in the Black Rose Castle and summoning followers to a brief meeting. At the end of the meeting, Li Determined the time to return to Nolande next time, and let Lina, who stayed at the Black Rose Castle, pay attention to the movement of Schumpeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xion Peter, what else can they do?" Lina is a little puzzled, and now Schumpeter is in a state of partial disability, Richard does not It’s not bad to go to them and they dare to challenge them again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "If I guess it is correct, they will not be sent for a long time. They should send people to come. If you have anything, if you are expensive, let me know. If you think it's normal, then take things away and drive people away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... ...you are too..." Master Long did not know how to evaluate this command of Richard. It seems that it is somewhat inconsistent with the style of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, don't forget, we are upstarts." Richard corrected her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard left, leaving Lina bored in the floating island of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the transmission array from floating island to black rose is now built, but the transmission cost of several thousand gold coins once makes people feel some pain, but it does not matter, Anyway, Lina herself is a magician, and the stable coordinates of the portals on both sides are enough for her to open the personal portal without consuming too much magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, the messenger of Bear Peter was on the door. When I saw the 'sincerity' of the Bear Peter family, Lina didn’t know it for a while. How to judge whether it is precious, she only felt that her standards and cognition were in a moment of confusion, so she immediately sent someone to call Richard back from the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he hurried back to Archimonde's floating island, Richard's face was quite unpleasant, because Lina only told him to come back, but refused to tell the messenger what he had sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Lina, Master Long just took Richard to a small living room, pointing mysteriously to the inside, letting Richard himself Go see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li opened the door of the living room and looked inside, but saw a dark-haired girl sitting on the central carpet and staring out the window. Her face and eyes are all in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the girl who once impressed Richard, the first time from the mouth of Sinclair, the second time is the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel is also the 'sincerity' of the Schumpeter family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorell." Richard's surprised voice awakened the girl, she looked at the door, but her eyes were still in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leeburn wants to question the Schumpeter family messenger who is behind and who stops at the stairs, such a dangerous woman. How to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the moment when the girl turned, she saw a delicate and gorgeous scroll in her hands, which is the soul slave reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha couldn’t help but sigh, feeling the ingenuity of the Duke of Peter Peter, not only sent Sosler over, but also feared that he was not at ease, with A soul slavery scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing Sosrel, let Richard think of Sinclair, and think of the actress who is poisonous and perverted, but filled with bitter and dark girls. When I thought about the experience of Sinclair, Richard’s heart shrank slightly, and his hand gently touched the extinction hanging around his waist. I don’t know if the notorious Presbyterian Church of the Bear Peter family was before sending Sosler. As usual, it was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel seems to be able to guess what he was thinking from Richard’s extremely subtle expression changes, and smiled bitterly and said, “I am more than Sinclair. It will protect yourself, and now the family elders will desperately want to please you, and will not do anything that is destined to irritate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit down the chair, then look at Sorsleel, who is still sitting on the ground, and ask: "Before Sinclair's death, the last wish is to let me kill you and the elders of the Schumpeter family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosler then calmed down and smiled a bit. He said, "So, Sinclair must tell you everything. Yes, her experience was caused by me. I sold her to the Presbyterian Church. In exchange for his own safety, but if I don't do it, the result will be that the two of us will join the damn 'night banquet', no one can be spared, at least now, one of us two is saved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds reasonable, but why is the person who preserves you, not her." Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel began to recall the past, her face gradually pale, she sighed and said: "She....... She is too naive, so can't keep it down It’s better to sacrifice her to save myself, so that one of us can escape the claws of those old guys.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and said : "Inexplicable logic, okay, you talk about it, I want you to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very beautiful, talented, and able to lead Snoring, in fact, Sinclair is not as good as me in this respect." Sosleel finished in one breath, as if she was afraid that Richard would not understand her preciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after listening to the lecture, there was not much expression, but he said faintly: "It’s better than Sinclair, and it doesn’t mean how strong you are."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to do everything you need me to do, and you don't have to doubt my loyalty." Sosler said, she wanted to tear open the soul slavery scroll, unexpectedly Richard reached out and took the soul slave reel from her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee threw the soul slavery reel to Lina, who stood by the door, and said, "This thing is precious and does not have to be used on you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel is stunned, the soul of slavery such as her beautiful and dangerous woman, should be difficult for any man to refuse the temptation, why Li Not only was it not tempted, but it was reluctant to use the scroll. It was really unattractive, and it was not as good as a reel, although the scroll was indeed precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel reluctantly kept a smile and asked, "You don't worry about my loyalty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
