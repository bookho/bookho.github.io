The special needs of the warrior, so I have specially designed the external parts, but the combat power is still inevitably reduced by 25%, which is a quarter, but compared with the existing arms, he still has obvious advantages, I put This warrior is named Frost Frost Warrior. You see this is a specially made super elite, so it has reached the 17th level and has the same wisdom as ordinary humans. The normal Frost Warrior is fifteen, and the elite is At the 16th level, as in the past, in order to alleviate your burden and reduce manufacturing costs, only the elite Frost Warrior will have the ability to link souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li I knocked on the armor of the Frost Warrior and asked, "What is this armor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the latest achievement I want to show you. First, when I wake up my real name, I have an analytical rule. The ability to get the son of Kim, the King of Iron and the Friends of Silver, let me greatly improve the progress of the analysis of the metal rules, breaking through the first stage, with the ability to apply metal to my creation, this will only be the brain Take you to a special unit, or by humans, you can call it a building. When you see it, you will know that any precious gift you give me will be rewarded immediately, a huge reward." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A splitter came to the front and stopped in front of Richard. After Richard boarded, he split the brain and carried Richard to the depths of the turbulent land. About a dozen kilometers away, a huge building appeared in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, Richard really felt that it was a building, it was too big, and even bigger than the mother’s nest. It is 100 meters high and 600 meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many doors on the side of the body. At some of the doorways, there are constantly worker bees feeding into various materials, and the materials absorbed by each door are different. One part is all kinds of ore, and the other part is sent to the body of various creatures, as well as a section of cut logs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others continue to have worker bees moving outwards, most of which are unusable wastes, but there are several gates where worker bees are moving out of neat strips of metal ingots, one of which has a passing speed. It's much slower. It takes a few minutes for a worker bee to come in and out. It either moves out of a set of armor, or moves out a few weapons. The armor is the armor that the creatures and cold irons that Richard saw in the Frost Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it can be seen that this building, correctly speaking, should be a huge creature, constantly absorbing various raw materials, and spitting out metal materials, even There is also a complete set of armor weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what you see is a flesh-and-blood furnace that purifies most of the known metals by digestion, acting the same as forging furnaces, of course, internally The operation process is completely different. As I analyze and control the metal rules, the metal products that can be purified by the flesh furnace will continue to increase. Maybe one day, the glass gold can also be extracted here. So far, the flesh furnace The most advanced metal that can be refined is cold iron. It happens that the cold iron has a large reserve in this plane. There is a small cold iron ore under the turbulent ground, but this mine can support the operation of two flesh furnaces, if you want To expand production capacity, it is necessary to transport ore from other regions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the huge flesh furnace, Richard was speechless, in contrast, The military base he and Nolan established was quite insignificant, and in Noland, the size of Richard’s military base could not be said to be small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the manual workshop, the flesh furnace represents another model, a model of ultra-mass production, perhaps only the melting pot of the polar gray dwarf can The flesh furnace is comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the famous melting pot is built on the melting lake of the underground volcano. This place can be difficult to find. It took decades to build it, and the mother The flesh furnace of the nest was grown in ten days. If it is really to compare, the flesh furnace leads the melting furnace for more than one generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the brain and flew back to the platform of the mother's nest. On the road, the mother's nest also sent a large number of arms maps for Richard. The choice, most of the arms can be disassembled into basic functional units, and then re-loaded, each time a design is designed, the parent nest will give a comprehensive score including the cost of creation and the source of raw materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the platform, there are three arms waiting for Richard's inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them looks like a high-headed horse, but the four-legged claws are similar to the beasts. The horse is just its camouflage appearance. The real ability is to use a long neck to form a passage, spray a special long arrow, it can shoot a range of up to 500 meters, the body can store fifty long arrows, the power within the range can penetrate the full body of the reloading knight A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of long-range unit called the arrow beast is a specialized unit specially used to make up for the lack of long-range attack power of Richard’s army, and it is the best solution. Whether in Faro or Noland, using a magician team for large-scale long-range attacks is too expensive and expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacking power of the arrow beast can even directly threaten the elite of the 14th level, and its own combat power is 12, which is only equivalent to ten according to consumption. At the level of the ranks, the current nest can produce thirty arrows and beasts in a day, and in just one month, it can provide Richard with a large-scale long-range strike force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a long-range shooter of human form, using common bows and arrows as weapons, their range is equal to that of the beast, but the power is lower than the arrow beast. The consumption is higher than the level of the arrow, and the humanoid shooter can shoot two hundred times in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superiority of the female archer is very obvious compared to the elite archer of the average human level 10, but when the beast arrow is next to it, the human archer is in full The disadvantage is that the mother's nest can only produce twenty-four humanoid archers a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th-level archer, when the hen is promoted to the 12th order, can be handed over to the nest for mass production, while the humanoid archer needs ten The third order can only be mass-produced, which means that the tactics of the human-shaped bow-handed sea can only be realized in the next few years, and the combat power is not as good as the arrow-beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now understands why the mother nest always says that human form is not a suitable form of combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last unit has attracted the interest of Richard, which is a sub-tend of a number of arms, named Feifei, which looks somewhat similar to Xingyi. But it is even more clumsy. In its complete form, it can be more than 100 meters in length and can even be even larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach can produce light gas in the body, so that it can float and rely on inhaling jets to advance. The speed of flying cockroaches is not fast, and the speed is only forty kilometers. However, it carries a huge amount of money. Each fly can carry dozens of tons of materials, which is equivalent to a medium-sized transport team, and the flying dragonfly can eat once and can fly for ten days. In a large-scale war, its strategic significance does not need to be Say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard confirmed the production of Frost Warrior, Arrow Beast and Fly, and Richard also let the Brood build a second flesh furnace as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new flesh furnace will be dedicated to refining the cold iron ore produced from several large mines in the Iron Triangle Empire and refining it The iron ingots are shipped back to Noland for sale. Each ton of cold iron ingots allows Richard to profit from tens of thousands of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the output of the flesh furnace, Richard can supply hundreds of tons of cold iron ingots every month, that is, about three or four million Profiting, with this cost, Richard can build a new elite force, or upgrade the equipment of his followers to a new level, to achieve all epic level configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard left the turbulent land, the voice of the mother's nest still echoed in his consciousness: "Master, I look forward to standing with you. The peak of the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is still young, and he can't help but boil in the chest at the moment. He patted the brain under his feet and split his brain to change direction. The land of the Grand Duke of Subaru flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the Grand Duke of Sabah has a poetic name, the Principality of the Beads, because at the foot of the snow-capped mountains in the north, the melting snow has become a series of beautiful In the lake, there is a bead chain on the neck of the goddess of ice and snow. The Principality is named after it. In the center of this bead chain, it is located in the capital of the Principality, and there is no winter city in the deep sea pearls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go directly to the No Winter City, but spent most of the day flying a round-trip over the entire Grand Duchy to close the Principality’s profile. fundus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of the Pearl River has a population of 3 million. There are dozens of cities in the country. The villages and towns are dotted around and fly around the Principality. Afterwards, Richard did not find any obvious spatial fluctuations, indicating that there was no strong torn space in the near future, but according to the information, there is no church in the Zhulian chain, and there is no god’s belief to enter this film. territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sneer on his lips, which is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the hundreds of years of blockade by the gods, the powerful locals of Faro can be described by ignorance, but the teachers of Noland’s origins Each of the common sense, many of the secrets that Faro can only be mastered by the gods, are printed in the textbooks that Nolande learned from the apprentices of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
