			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side of the world is not empty, but as empty as the vague, vast and boundless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking away, you can see a group of things that are twisted and twisted and can’t be said. These are the planes of the dark side and the mainland. There is a strong energy in the void, and there is also a horrible energy storm. Energy follows the rules of chaos, so it is particularly violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone is hiding under the shield of FS. This kind of storm is not a violent thing for FS. But before the rules of the dark side were solved, the fauna was constantly drifting, and it was impossible to anchor the direction. Even Richard did not know where he was drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark side of the world, even if you feel that you are not standing still, you may actually drift at high speed. This is very similar to the dark area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While passing the rules he parsed to the followers, Richard explores the surrounding space. As the control of the rules is strengthened, the scope of the perception of expansion is also getting farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day is hundreds of meters, the next day is over the kilometer, the third day is three kilometers... In this way, the whole dark The curtain of the face gradually opened in front of Richard's eyes, presenting a world that is distorted, chaotic, and grotesque to the orderly creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After starting to control the rules for a month, Richard’s perception has been able to cover thousands of kilometers. Fu Shide began to adjust the course and sailed to the nearest chaotic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heading of the floating world will also shift from time to time, and the speed will be somewhat slow and fast. This is because the followers have not yet fully digested the dark rules that Richard passed to them. It is to put the power of the rules in front of the local, and it takes time to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the followers brought by Richard are all the strong ones of Noland. The speed of their control of the rules is not comparable to Richard’s, but also It’s amazing. As the day passed, Fauvist's heading shift was getting smaller and faster, and the speed was getting faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months after Richard began to control the dark-faced rule, Faust took the first remote void transmission. This time it took hundreds of thousands of kilometers to transfer. But in terms of the functions of the floating world, this crossing is only the initial attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two and a half months, after continuous transmission, Faust was close to the Chaos continent for the first time. This continent is completely different from the plane of the light, and it does not have a crystal wall that protects against energy storms. The violent energy storm directly hits the surface of the mainland, fiercely tearing everything that is not tyrannical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic continent looks like a piece of rotten meat with a pus on it. There is no such thing as a shape. Almost everything on the surface has been sleek and smooth by the chaotic storm, and those terrains that are still rugged and sharp have made Richard faintly wary. Obviously, even things that can't be dealt with by Chaos Storm will certainly not be simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the chaotic continent, there is also life. It’s all like a guy who’s piled up like rotten meat. It used to be only in the consciousness of nightmares and madmen. But now, Richard has seen a lot of big guys moving towards the floating world on the chaotic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chaotic continent is in fact very huge, and in the measurement of Richard’s consciousness, it is several times larger than the mainland of Noord. The chaotic behemoth that can be seen from the void is naturally more terrifying. They are at least hundreds of kilometers long and are truly big guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not have any idea of ​​fighting with them. Faust was sent around the chaotic continent several times, and Richard scanned the entire surface of the continent. He did not find a clue on this continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the range of perceived coverage of Richard has exceeded 100,000 kilometers and is still expanding. In the world where chaotic rules prevail, the differences in power between individuals are constantly magnified, the stronger the stronger, and the weaker the weaker. For the control of chaotic rules, every step forward, the power will have a leap-forward development. This is not the case on one side of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While nothing has been gained, Faust has started a new transmission and continues to explore in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, fascinated flying over a chaotic continent, and occasionally fighting chaotic monsters appearing in the void. The battle was initially arranged by Richard, and as the peak powerhouse, it is also the top level in the world. However, later on, as the followers' rule control increased, more and more people were able to participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a certain battle, Hilo, who participated in the first battle, made an all-out effort, actually shot hundreds of kilometers in the void, and blew several chaotic behemoths in a row. Suddenly, he shocked him on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful feeling like never before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dark side of the world, the passing place of the law of chaos, the ultimate paradise of all the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one aspect of the light, there is also the sacred domain to kill the legend, the legendary siege is super strong, but in the dark side, this possibility is not at all presence. The huge power gap allows superpowers to kill groups of legends like slaughtering sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the followers are able to do it, Richard will not shoot. The thing he has to do is to fully control the rules of the dark side and explore the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time left for him is not much, and then he can't find the whereabouts of Su Helun, then Faust has to return. Although no one knows whether the long-lived creatures of light will be assimilated in the dark side of the world, one thing is certain, the time of the dark channel is limited, when he is truly assimilated by the will of the abyss. The two sides will have to fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s perception swept over a vain area of ​​150,000 kilometers, suddenly his heart jumped in undetectable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately held his breath and felt that he once again swept through the area. This time it was a slow search and finally found the thing that made his heart move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little blue star! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly flew up from the volcano and waved a hundred-meter-long blue flame blade, a chaotic behemoth that was battling with fascinating He was in two halves and then said to the followers: "Turn! Keep up with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge volcano began to turn slowly, and Richard has waited Not enough, a direct transmission, it appears next to the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starburst flashes with a faint radiance. It uses the force of star power as its original force, and it cannot be replenished in the dark side of the world. It is close to the edge of extinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and gestured, and Xingman felt the star power in his body, immediately jumped into his palm, blended into the skin, and sent a small message to Richard. It is a coordinate, a place marking the distant space, and the hiding place where Su Hailun is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's hands were shaking a little, looking for so long, experienced countless hardships, and hoped to finally shine at the touch of his hand. The picture in destiny finally has the opportunity to change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s face suddenly turned cold, and Sen Han’s eyes swept over the surrounding void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, there are countless mechanical warships that slipped out and surrounded Richard. Even if his eyes are closed, Richard can recognize them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These reapers appear here at this time, the purpose is not to mention, naturally a trap, the bait is the star-shaped coordinates left by Su Hailun. It seems that most of the scholars who ambushed Su Hailun on the same day had some relationship with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it doesn't matter, just rely on Faro's war, and they appear in this place in this way, Richard will never let them go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Richard is only 28, but the strength has been jumped from the super power of the day to the peak of today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wait for the fascinating squad, a flash jumped thousands of kilometers, appeared in the reaper battleship group, and then the invisible force field quietly covered the surrounding The range of 100 kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two largest reaper warships, all the other warships and fighters began to roll and float irregularly, completely losing control. Then the fighters and the slightly smaller warships began to distort, as if they were smashed by invisible big hands, and they were turned into metal balls in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Li was swept over the two largest warships, reaching out and knocking on their outer shells. The two warships immediately disintegrated themselves and were dismantled into numerous Small and small parts, and all lost their vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in front of Richard, there is a silver metal drum that is more than one meter long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the few Reaper parts that Richard has not been able to break the rules. It is also the brain of the Reaper, or, to be precise, a command receiver and control center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this silver drum, there is a consciousness that communicates with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a feminine, and somewhat feminine and hysterical voice: "My cute little builder! Welcome to the dark side of the world! I have already waited You have been disappointing for a long time, and you finally did not let me down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Richard asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who am I?" The voice made a hysterical laugh, then gasped and said: "We will treat this as a little secret! Wait for you. I passed some of my little tests... As a reward, you will know who I am!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am rewarding this No interest!" Richard's voice did not fall, suddenly bent on a metal drum! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drum was instantly disintegrated and turned into countless parts. Richard shot his hand and grabbed a crystal. But before he touched the crystal, the crystal suddenly shattered, and the consciousness inside it dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, it echoes his last scream: "You will pay for it!! I swear!!..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his wrinkle and whispered, "Let him escape again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Only a little, Richard can conceal the consciousness hidden in the reaper and find out his body. However, this guy behind the scenes is also very fast. At first glance, the situation is not right, and there is no chance for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden brilliance in the back of the sky, and the floating world emerged from the light and slipped into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus is faster than Richard on ultra-long-range mobile, but it cannot be compared to Richard on short-range transmission. When Faust was approaching, Richard had used all the kings of the metal to rise to gather all the reaper wrecks together, turned into a huge metal ball, and threw it into the fauna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu pushed the metal wreckage to the desired position and said, "Head! We seem to have come to the Reaper's nest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
