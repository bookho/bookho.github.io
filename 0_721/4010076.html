			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard feels black again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Blood is excited. You will be cleaned by the power of time, so that the hidden blood abilities can be fully stimulated and awakened by a superior blood, which can be further strengthened by the power of time. Based on your current blood, the abilities you can choose are as follows: Ability 'burn' (hot, advanced version, which increases spellcasting speed by 50%, based on Arcmond Blood); ability 'Powerful Summon' (to make Nature Summon spell summon creature level Increase the level, summon the maximum number by three. Based on the natural nature of the Elven Bloodline; Ability 'Permanent Vitality', (in any case, your vitality and magic recovery speed will double. Based on the Elf Bloodline Recovery ability) Ability to 'Star Rain', (the effect of the Dark Blue series of meditation is doubled, based on the ability of the Elf Bloodline Magic Star). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not dared to look any further. He didn't know what special abilities his blood was able to motivate. Therefore, although every blood awakening is a surprise, you need to adjust your own direction to maximize your blood, that is, after all, Choose. Now that Shen En has put the initiative to his hand, there are dozens of best combinations in the mind. He almost immediately blocked the instinct of wisdom talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These front-facing abilities are extremely powerful, almost the strongest ability of Akmend and Silvermoon Elf to awaken. For example, ‘strong summoning’ is only a little worse than Su Hailun’s ‘Summon Master’. The Summon Master is a legendary blood abilities, looking at the mainland, and how many abilities can match it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Below Su Hailun’! With such an evaluation, Richard can definitely be proud of his blood. And these capabilities are still potential. I don't know when and where I will wake up. Now I just need to reach out and I can have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So easy, so powerful, but how to refuse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. How could this be? Why are there so many choices, such powerful choices? Every choice made Richard feel completely unable to refuse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they appear in front of Richard. Richard is still a person, a person with flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his eyes mechanically and turned to the third option. This time, Richard is not shocked, just looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Enlightenment. Your body will awaken the third blood, which will be randomly selected from the following blood: ordinary dragon; ancient behemoth; holy unicorn; Kaimo plane traveler; larvae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth item is God's grace: mysterious metamorphosis. Your magic will add a new legendary attribute (such as Star Power, the power of the crescent moon, time...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not in a hurry to see The fifth grace, but close your eyes and think, if the man is faced with this situation, how will it react? After thinking for a moment, Richard suddenly opened his eyes, stood up, laughed and said, "On this point, he, mom, wants to seduce." Laozi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been elegant or calm, this is the influence of the blood of the elf, but also the patience of the long-term drawing of the composition. It’s really inconsistent with Richard’s consistent image. What is wonderful is that after this swearing mouth blurted out, Richard suddenly felt that his heart was a lot easier, and the temptation of a god of grace seemed to suddenly drop a level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of roads leading to the peak, and why do you want to be a gift? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s domineering, in the moment of standing up straight, Richard has learned five or six points. He calmly and fluently read a sacred grace, which is to broaden his horizons. At least let him have a more broad and clear understanding of his potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a different angle, the world has become extremely open. Richard found that the content of reading God's grace itself has gained a lot, and there is no need to really own them. A graceful grace is actually the same as pointing out the direction of progress for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one hundred and twelve items of grace, Richard suddenly looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Sharing. Assign divine grace to the specified target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the last grace, so Richard did not hesitate to reach out and distribute all the remaining gods to the drifting sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing so, Richard only thought that this was the promise of Vatican’s great priest, and since it was promised, it should be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not realize that he was actually willing to pay for the quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand flowing outside the light curtain is very lengthy. Normally, the sacrifice should have ended soon. How can it be dragged to the present? But there is no sign of the will of the eternal and timeless dragons. At this moment, a few pale golden light belts came across the sky, rushing into the body of the sand, and the huge grace that poured into it instantly made her feel awkward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? How did God come to me?" The heart of the sand was in a mess. She knows the amount of divine grace, which means that in addition to strengthening the grace of the plane, Richard assigns all the remaining divine grace to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should he give himself grace, or so much? Is it... what does he already know? The bottom of the sand was trembled, but it denied the idea. This is a secret, a secret that only the title person will know. And by the gods: the obstruction of the secret commandment, can not be said, can only communicate between the title. As with the principle of eternal and timeless dragons, the acquisition of titles also requires a corresponding price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain of time has disappeared, and Richard walks out from inside with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is suddenly awkward, it seems that Richard at this moment is a little different from the past. But where is different, but can't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She greeted Richard and hurriedly asked: "How do you assign God's grace to me? Your own strength is the first." If you are always impulsive, how can you lead us to conquer one plane? I also count on you to hold a lot of sacrifices so that I can give more points of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of later, the tone of the sand has become a blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a handful of hands and said helplessly: "There is no way, there is only one such option, what do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one option? Only let you assign God's grace? How is this possible?" The sands screamed. Judging by her common sense, I know that this is simply impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true! I don't want to!" Richard looked shiny and innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
