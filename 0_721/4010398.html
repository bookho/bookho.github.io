Return to the plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few planes, Richard was quite insane. In the end, his eyes fell on Hughland and said, "Let's go here." Let’s take a look.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen Ma’s beautiful eyebrows are a little accidental, and then I look at Richard with interest, but Richard’s is a The series of orders, redeployed the work of the followers, the warrior work of the Black Rose Castle has been completed, the entire 3,000-step Knights are compiled into the ranks, and there are also free Archimonde, as well as other family freedom fighters. Come and ask for entry, so Richard now has a full three hundred candidate knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent people to recall all the followers of Faro, and also transferred one hundred elite knights, and now Richard’s deep In the Red Principality, only Anrekara and Mika defended the overall situation, but Richard believed that as long as there was Anrekara, the human kingdom of Faro would not dare to do anything now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes two days for all the followers to gather, during which time everyone is active. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee, as in the past, repeatedly studied the map in the war room, and from time to time asked Senma about the situation and customs of Shulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughland is a rather strange plane, the whole plane is only a continent of less than one million square kilometers, surrounded by the ocean, so The small land is not so much a mainland. It is more appropriate to say that it is a big island. The mainland is like an uneven fusiform shape. The ends are sharp and the middle is wide. The terrain is from the south to the north and the north is the whole continent. The highest snow mountain, more than 10,000 meters above sea level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s foothold is at the southernmost tip of the mainland. After more than ten years of business, it now occupies two-fifths of the entire continent. Indigenous warfare is also quite fierce. With the help of the Great Rift Valley in the central part of the mainland, it has blocked the squadron of Gordon, and there has been a fierce tug-of-war and positional battle. The battle was carried out three times. In the month, the power of this plane consumed more than half of the army of Caston at the expense of three times the casualties, and eventually forced Gotton to stop moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do your best, Gordon is not an indigenous person who can't completely defeat the Hughland plane, but the price will be particularly heavy. The army recruited from this plane may be worn out. At that time, Gordon will face a mess. In the situation, the development level of Hughland is actually very low. This can be seen from the fact that the cost of transmitting a person from the plane is as high as 30,000. Such a high cost, so that the military expenses are extremely scarce, can only transfer a very small number of elites. In the later period, as Gordon's stalls grew bigger and bigger, only 13 Cavaliers were able to enter and exit Shulan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Richard chose Shulan is because it is a rather strange plane, the whole continent is very small, and it is surrounded by the sea, according to the local The natives said that the sea has no end. From ancient times to the present, there are countless people who have gone out to sea, but they have never seen any one back, and the people of Gordon have found that there is no life in the sea, only salty water, which can be extracted from the sea. Salt, but there is no life, not to mention the whale shark, even if the seaweed can not find a piece, so in the local dictionary, there should be no such words as fish and shrimp, but in a mysterious temple occupied by Gotton, Also discovered a mural about the mysterious life in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Hulan’s map, how to see how it felt wrong, he frowned for a moment, asked the next to Senma: “This Hulan Where is the map of the plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Noland, the mainland map is an important, precious and difficult to obtain strategic resource, although Shulan is very small However, the fineness of the map is unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma said: "We took a temple and found the map from it. At first we didn't take it too seriously, but we found it later. The map was amazingly accurate, and then copied a lot of copies according to the map, instead of the map we had drawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most of the continents on the north end of the plane The peak pointed, said: "So these places are also copied from the original map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, is there anything weird?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing." Richard shook his head, but his heart was always a little uncomfortable. This uncomfortable feeling came mainly from the northern end of the mainland. The highest peak, from the map, the highest point of this peak is almost equal to the coastline, which means that the northern end of the sea should be a 10,000-meter-high sea cliff, which is not like the naturally generated terrain, it seems to be a certain The power of infinite power is cut from the mainland, and the name of this highest peak is called God's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard and Senma have been talking for a long time. They have a better understanding of the situation and customs of Shulan. Although Shulan is small, it has a very strong power system. The strongest here also reaches the legendary level, and not only One, Hughland has a very developed magical civilization, but the development is not the magical structure of Noland, but a saint totem similar to Calando. The soldiers with totem patterns are obviously stronger than others. A little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard about Senma’s introduction, Richard suddenly thought of something and quickly moved out of an alchemy calculator and began to quickly calculate it based on the data on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma stood quietly on the side, waiting for the result. After half an hour, Richard stood up and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong." Senma couldn't help but ask, she never had much patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The size of the plane is somewhat wrong. According to the mathematical calculations of the plane I have studied, if the plane is to produce a strong legend, the area should be better than the present. Much larger, the mainland area must be at least 10 million square kilometers, and it must meet many harsh conditions. Now Shulan is really too small, that is, creatures with fifteen or more levels are very reluctant."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma knows nothing about the mathematics of the plane, but finally understands the meaning of Richard and says: "There are indeed legendary powerhouses, we have encountered one, but it was only Seriously injured him, and finally let him run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows wrinkle tighter, contemplative for a long time, reach out and take a picture on the map, "I understand, it's here, we're going all out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All-out attack." Summa was shocked, but she knew very well how many troops that Richard had gathered. If you bring the elite troops to the past, then the channel is the cost of transmission. Only ten million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This plane must have a major secret, and more points should be used," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Multiple points, how much are you going to invest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All followers go all , the construction of the knight to go to one hundred, the elite knights and knights all go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's words made Senma take a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been fighting side by side with Richard for a short time, and she has not fully realized the difference between Richard and Gordon. In the eyes of other paladins, Richard is only a little bit more expensive than Gotton, but Richard is now stationed in the elite of the Black Rose Castle. There are already a total of 400 people, including the knights and followers. The plane transmission fee for the payment will exceed 15 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem with Gotton’s money. The quantitative change causes qualitative change, as Gordon said that the degree of the outbreak exceeds the people’s tolerance. The ability will also be accepted by people. Just like the bloodthirsty Philip, now the deeds of his Majesty have been excavated, and even the almost sturdy ribs that must be eaten at every meal have become popular. Fashion, except for the top giants, the aristocrats of course can't afford the ribs. It is the ground dragon's hind legs that can't afford to eat, so you can just smash the raw beef to show fashion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma looked at Richard’s gaze and suddenly became tender and watery. This little boy didn’t take long before he became such a charming man. It really surprised her. In the eyes of Senma, wealth and strength are all part of the power of men, and they are the most important part. If you are handsome, it will be better. If you are not handsome, it doesn't matter. For one can be on the transfer fee. For a man who has gone out to get 15 million yuan, it’s not important at all. In fact, Richard is quite depressed. This time he sacrificed so many sacrifices. For helplessness, perhaps this is the characteristic of the eternal and timeless dragon sacrifice, always giving you what you want, but not urgently needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma suddenly reached out and grabbed Richard’s shoulder. The body leaned on Richard’s back, and the bulging chest was clearly labeled with Richard. Asked: "If I give you as a follower, how much can I get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and asked a little strangely: "Give me a follower, You are not planning to wait for the song to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I was still young at the time, he just sent me this armor, he lied. I have sold him for more than ten years, and it is enough. You know, the little girl is very good at cheating. Now, you only need to send me three sets, no, five sets of armor, I can be you. Followers, you see, my request is not high, if you do not have ready-made armor, then the discount or fold into something can also be given to me." Senma double-eyed shines the light of gold coins, enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
