			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Richard, Mei Lin feels weird and laughs, seeing Richard When he was a person, when he saw people and people, and in the forest, people are sometimes not necessarily useful, the forest will have obvious suppression of all outsiders, and Richard does not Mei Lin explained, but let her take a wooden house to find a rest, prepared some water and fruit, and made a dinner for the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard’s thoughts are in turmoil, and in any case, he can’t calm down and meditate. Many dusty memories are in my heart, and my heart is full of unspeakable. The taste is now certain that the Yongyue tribe and the Silver Moon elves in the Everlasting Forest are inextricably linked. The elders are acquaintances of Gordon and Elani, and there is no real hostility, or else With her strength, she can already kill Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha originally thought that the elders were just ordinary legends, so they dared to come to see her alone, but now it seems that the elders are much stronger than the ordinary legends. Between the super strong and the legend, but when I met, Richard also smelled the rancid smell, the taste can only be emitted from the elders, it seems that her injury is really heavy, otherwise it will not even The rancid smell can't be controlled, so who can hurt her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of unanswered questions, Richard ushered in a new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, he went to see the elders, the elders still sat in their own living room, and a few more in front of her, above She placed her guns and Richard's elf knife side by side. When Richard entered, she still let Merlin leave, then looked at Richard and said, "You must have guessed that I am related to your parents. To be exact, Elani is my best sister, but after I was attacked by your father in the Yongye Forest, I never saw her again. My name is 茜..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders came, and Richard listened quietly, a secret history that was unknown, and it was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that year, after the separation of Elannie and Gonton, they returned to the Yongye Forest. At that time, Gordon, this rough man was quietly I settled in the heart of Elani, but Elani is the sacrifice of the moon god A Lucia, and it is also the next big sacrifice. She must remain pure, pure in body and soul, so Elani put this Duan Xinshi was deeply buried in the bottom of my heart. It was only once when I was extremely depressed. I once mentioned it once with you. At that time, no matter whether you were embarrassed or Ilani, I thought that I would never see the young man who had brushed many horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Elan, there was concern, and the progress on the monthly force became slow. In the everlasting forest at that time, the Elf Wang Ting nominally ruled the entire forest, but in fact, several of the great elves were doing their own, Wang. The court is actually in a state of division. There are many contradictions among the elves. The arrogance, prejudice and short-sightedness are rampant. Even many elves have proposed the slang to regain lost ground and rebuild the elf empire. At that time, the high elves in the night forest were all added. Not more than 100,000 together, the population is still not as many as the standing army of the three major empire of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the young cockroaches could not understand the chaos of the Elf Wang Ting, and they were also depressed in their hearts. They left the Yongye Forest and went to other planes to hone their martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, they did not expect that Gordon came back, and in this way met with Elani, fate is cold, It is an occasional joke, and it only makes people laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you returned to the Yongye Forest, you saw the scene of the rest of the robbery, the Elf Wang Ting was broken, the tree of life was also felled, dragged Going to the Eternal Dragon Hall as a sacrifice, there are many surviving high elves in the Everlasting Forest. They eventually gather together, ready to cross the sacred dynasty, and the white sand plain, and finally go to the sea in the western part of the continent. After the attack on the Qing Dynasty, the Gotton broke the Elf Wang Ting and then quietly withdrew. Perhaps it was because of the loss of pressure. At the time of assembly, the surviving King Elfs had a dispute over the struggle for leadership and even started. Civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when Gotton attacked the Everlasting Forest, these great elves were not united, and some even deliberately did not send reinforcements, so they could be wiped out by the hands of Gordon. His own enemies, Gordon's war smell is extremely keen, when the plan is about to count, the most combative elves will be broken one by one, when the Elf kings realize that the situation is wrong, it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of things made you disappointed with these great elves, and she was tired of never ending infighting and war, so she decided to lead a group of elves of her own tribe. Carry out the plane expedition, go to the plane that the ancestors had discovered, and open up a new life. The plane is the green forest. However, the silver moon elves at that time are no longer strong in the period of the elves, and the open channel is fragile and not Stable, the elders in the tribe in order to resist the erosion of the power of time, all fallen, and eventually the entire tribe lived to reach more than a hundred people in Green Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most talented warrior at the time, he inherited the position of the elders. She asked all the tribes to not mention the past of Noland, so that a new generation When they were born, they thought they were the elves of Greenson. In the past 20 years, Noland has been here for more than 100 years. The tree of life that was planted by hand in the beginning has become a mature stage. The big tree is more mature than the Richard tree, and this tree of life is moved from the Elf Wang Ting. Even if it is not very suitable for the Greenson plane, it has the potential to grow into a world tree. Oh, it has also changed from the girl of the year to the legendary warrior of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been more than a hundred years...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sister of this mother’s year, Richard didn’t feel awkward, and he smelled a touch of faintness in his nose. The rancid smell can not help but ask: "Great elders, no... Hey, what is your injury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed and said: "I have the curse of the devil, Iscara, from the annihilation plane. The power of the curse is far beyond my ability to bear. I have not lived for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destroy the devil of the plane." This is a name that Richard has never heard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 said: "The annihilation plane is a world near the deepest part of the world. It is filled with the power of destruction and annihilation. All material forms are difficult to maintain, but There are also life there, the number is very small, but they are extremely powerful. After each individual matures, they have the power of the devil, and can even maintain a short life in the turbulent flow of time, the patron saint of the silver moon elves, Alucia The dead enemy Soda is a demon who annihilates the plane. There, its name is called the 16th night, so the annihilation plane has always been the enemy of our elves."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Iskra, he came to Greenson." Richard was shocked to ask, if it was, it would be fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜He shook his head and said: "He can't come... I just spelled a spell with his projection in the time storm between the planes. This is the curse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she coughed for a while, and then continued: "Iskara, seems to specialize in lies, deception and curse, it appears It is not accidental near Greenson, but someone who has been summoned to summon its will... is a guardian elf of the tree of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard frowned and asked: "Don't you say that destroying the demon is the enemy of all elves? How to guard the elves will also summon his will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 shaked his head "I don't know, but you have to be careful about the world tree here. I suspect that its will has been distorted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察敏I found out that you are using you, not us. Immediately, I was shocked and said, "Oh, don't worry about your injury. I can take you back to Noland, where the Eternal Dragon Hall is. Several large Priest with my good relationship, they must have a way can save you "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
