			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another magister takes two pages and sends them to Su Hailun . The legendary mage swept over and jumped up: "He improved the fireball technique? Let me see what has been improved.... A total of seven improvements! It's really good, you can cast a three-level fireball at the first level. Even my year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage suddenly coughed and then went on to say, "When I became a first-level magician, I could Just put a four or five fireballs. But the little guy is a genius, a builder, and the blood of Archimonde! Hey, hehe, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun repeatedly looked at the two pages of paper in his hand, it seems that he always looked at the same, and finally he couldn’t help but laugh. In the laughter of the publicity, the legendary mage said to the gray dwarf: "Let's do this, adjust the budget of Xiao Licha this month, um, increase it under my joy..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific figures have not yet been exported. The gray dwarf who knows the temper of the legendary Master immediately screams loudly: "Your Highness, your mood seems to be too happy!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master who understood it, although he couldn’t stop laughing, decided to put the timing of the budget adjustment back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the future sacred architects are ignorant of what happened. Xiao Licha is standing naked in the bathroom and pouring a pot of cold water on his head. The magic heating equipment in the living area has long been turned off by him. This system is comfortable and comfortable, and can be kept at a constant temperature throughout the year, but the price of running for one month is 1000 gold coins. The pot of iced water was poured on the body, so that every muscle of Richard could not help but twitch. But the only way to stop the boiling blood that is constantly flowing in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the duel and Papan’s melee, to the trepidated feet on the duel, Richard now doesn’t know why he’s doing this at the time. Crazy move. Is it for Papan’s insult to her mother? But certainly not all for this reason. The one that grabbed Papan’s head and fell to the ground, and the second fireball that was ready to be shot in the duel field, were all actions that could kill him. Richard, who also carries the simple nature of the mountain, still believes that although Papan must be punished, he is far from killing him. However, at that time, the insulted Richard only felt a burning blood flow to the top of his head, and the whole body seemed to fall into the furnace. Papan in his eyes has become extremely hateful, and even Richard feels that it is difficult to dilute the hatred in his chest! So putting Papan’s face on the ground is just the beginning. In the duel, Richardson can overdraw the magic, but also to pat Papan on the spot. The second fireball will definitely make Papan, which has no magical defense ability, become a humanoid torch, and it will die very painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overdraft magic is a taboo for the magician. According to the magical power of the overdraft, the light will slow down the recovery of the magic. The time is from one month to several years. It will reduce the magic of the magician, and may even die directly. This is a heavy price, but Richard is willing to pay any price, just to kill Papan. But even if Papan was killed a hundred times, it would not be enough to pour the anger of Little Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the duel, Richard was groggy and hardly knew how he returned to the residential area. He only vaguely felt that the people around him suddenly increased, and his anxiety and concern were many times more than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard woke up again, it was already the third day after the duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of boiling blood is still there, so that Richard still can't help but have some idea of ​​going to Papan again. Xiao Li immediately found out that his condition was not normal, his temper became unusually violent, and he would succumb to murder from the bottom of his heart, and even some could not control his actions. Until now, he wanted to swear something, so that he could quietly vent his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! Another pot of cold water poured down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this weather, although Richard’s body is far stronger than the average boy, it is still shivering and pale. But when the chill came early, Richard felt that the burning blood was rushing, and this time it also faintly resonated with the magic of his body. As soon as Richard gritted his teeth, he grabbed the wooden bucket again with the already stiff hand, picked up a bucket of water, and then shoveled a shovel of crushed ice and poured it into the bucket. This simple action is very difficult to do, because most of the joints are already stiff and the fingers are completely lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard struggled to lift the barrel, there was a crisp, sweet voice behind him: "Hey! Is anyone inside? Come out and eat." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This frightening suddenness made Richard's brain blank, just like when he was a child in the mountains, he was quietly put his neck from behind. The instinct of training in the mountains made him immediately throw down the barrel, barely rushing backwards, trying to fight with the attackers. As soon as he turned around, Richard saw a young girl standing at the door of the shower and looking straight into the inside. Richard recognized that this was a girl who had been paying her bills all the time, but she could not control the stiff body and rushed to the girl and threw her to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has been close to the 14th Five-year-old boy, and the girl is almost the same. The girl was pressed underneath and immediately screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, Richard’s clear-cut mind has now become a little groggy, and things that can be clearly thought out in a moment can take a long time to understand. His body temperature has dropped very low, but the deep boiling blood is still restless. And the girl clothes underneath are very thin, and the dark blue magic robes are both warm-keeping. Even in the winter, there is no need for too much clothes. Therefore, the shape of the girl's body and the hot body temperature can be clearly felt through the soft cloth. The collision between the cold skin and the hot body of the girl has brought the feeling of Xiao Licha to an unprecedented keen state. The girl's body is both soft and elastic, full of youthful atmosphere. Richard suddenly had a strange feeling that it seemed that some part of the body was waking up. And those boiling blood seems to have found the target, rushing down. However, the blood that leads to the awakening part does not seem to be very smooth, and the effectiveness of the first few barrels of ice water is still there. After boiling a long way, the progress becomes slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you? How did you get in?" Richard tried to keep a limited lucidity and asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am responsible for delivering food to you. But you have been asleep, I have been here twice, how do you know that you will suddenly disappear...唉哟"The girl said innocently, she was knocked over by Richard, and she was dizzy, and now she began to suffer from severe pain." Although she is already a formal second-level magician, the magician is not as powerful as the warrior. Most magicians have a much stronger body than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered that he still pressed the girl underneath, so he apologized to want it, but the cold and stiff joints did not make him happy, just When he lifted his half body, he threw himself on the girl. He struggled a few more times, but it seemed to be intentionally worn on the girl. After all, Richard is not a warrior. The effectiveness of the buckets of ice water is not so easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
