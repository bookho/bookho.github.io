			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded hard and ran back to his room. But looking at his excitement, most of the night is not sleeping. Elaine shook his head with a smile and climbed into the attic with a magic lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attic is a place where things are usually piled up, but it is also cleaned. Elaine moved a box to reveal a small altar behind him. The altar is stone, and the basic part outlines the complex magical array with delicate and accurate strokes. It’s just that the position of the idol should be placed, but now it’s blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan carefully cleaned the altar and wiped the tiniest dust on it. Then he stood up and his eyes fell on a thick book placed freely on the side of the box. The book is surprisingly thick, fearing that it is nearly a thousand pages, and is equivalent to four of the ordinary magic books, at least a dozen kilograms. The bronze-coloured cover shines brightly and is not stained, and is obviously often flipped through. Yilian has a glimpse, she has not touched it for a long time, then obviously it is Richard. I just didn't expect that the little guy actually read so often, so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan walked over and reached out to open it. Her fingers are long and beautiful, and they are several levels higher than their looks. The men in the village talked about her hands more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of the book is real bronze cast, heavy and cold, exudes the heavyness of the years. Elaine knows that in bronze, hundreds of crystal granules are scattered like stars, and when they are simultaneously excited, they form a miniature altar. When the user is pious and powerful enough, he can even listen to the moon god through it. The voice of A Lucia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the title page, the long poems of the tribute to the moon, Alucia, are written in beautiful Elves. Until today, Elaine still remembers every syllable of this hymn. Elaine flipped through it, and the textured pages swept through the fingers like water, or a large piece of elf text, or a vivid illustration. Unlike the human scriptures, the content of Luna's teachings is only a small part of it, and there are many stories of the gods before Lucia. Therefore, in addition to the continent of Noland, it also contains a lot of content outside the continent, even the ectopic plane. Xiao Licha probably thought of it as a geography of geography, only to see it with gusto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book, besides the heavy ones, can’t see anything surprising, the most precious treasure of the Elven Wang Ting, the goddess of the moon, Ai Lu The Holy Scriptures of West Asia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Scriptures actually records the unique magical power of the seven-month-old goddess, but only those who are recognized by the goddess can see and use it. In the same year, she can use five of them. In addition to Wang Ding's great Druid, she is the most acclaimed god. That represents strength and represents the approval of the goddess. But now, even if it is a huge price, she can only inspire one of the gods, or use the power of the Holy Scripture itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven magical techniques flow through her heart like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Destiny of Ai Lucia": Enlightenment;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Lucia "Dream": healing; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arricia's anger" magic: sanctions;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sword of Ailsia": Art of Silver Moon;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai Lucia's Will": The Judgment <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other gods, one of which is "A Lucia's that she also failed to master." Heart" magic: foresee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh deity is simply recorded in the Holy Scriptures, but no one has ever been able to use it, that is, "The Lost of A Lucia", Divine magic: the dark side of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan put his hand on the holy scripture and quietly felt the sacred atmosphere left in the holy scripture. The fifth moon is hanging in the sky, and the cold moonlight shines through her skylight on the roof. A hint of divine power hidden in the moonlight quietly infiltrates into her body, accumulates and reserves for the rituals ten days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: Enlightenment, is the birthday gift of Xiao Licha, ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of Little Richard’s birthday, or at midnight, he was called up, taken to the attic, and reached the altar. The Holy Scriptures in front of Richard have turned to a specific page with a few lines of prayer that he has never seen before. That is the ancient Elvish language. This arduous language Richard has mastered the same versatility as the lingua franca. The content of Prayer is still the praise and prayer of the goddess of the moon, but Richard is silent in his heart, but suddenly there is a strange feeling, it seems that the body is becoming transparent, and what is in the dark is nothing. The destination was patrolling, but it seemed to suddenly discover something, flew over to him, and rushed into the body. Li felt that there was an ice flow in the chest and abdomen, which stretched out and spread to the lower limbs. This feeling is flashing away, although it is very clear, but it is very common to have a special feeling during the sacrifice of the god or the magical ritual. There are many rituals that even endure intense pain. Therefore, Xiao Li did not say anything, but continued to gradually empty his mind as required by his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Richard, in a moment you will enter the hall of the goddess Ai Lucia and accept the enlightenment about fate. You are likely to have two or There are three choices. If there is, you can choose..." Here, Yi Lian suddenly shook his head and changed his mouth and said, "My Richard, what do you want to choose, pay attention to the voice of the goddess, then Follow your inner choices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know how to understand. With the soft prayer of Elaine behind him, his consciousness gradually blurred and seemed to be withdrawing from the world in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was awake again, Richard found himself in front of an extremely wide and high temple. The place where he stood was a huge square with a few kilometers, and he was in it. Richard felt that he was as small as an ant. The square is paved with silver-gray stone, sparkling with a mysterious glow. He looked around and saw that there was an endless starry sky, and the little stars seemed to be able to pick it up. The square and the temple are alone in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge space brings little pressure to Little Richard, his heart beats faster and faster, no longer dare to look around, It was pulling the feet to the temple. He ran for a long time, crossed the entire square, and climbed the thousand stone steps before standing at the entrance to the temple. If the children in the mountains were physically strong and have long-term endurance from an early age, Richard was already tired. After he ran up, he did not dare to pause. The huge square filled the whole field of vision, and the shining light leaped. It seems that the whole space is not static, but is moving in accordance with certain rules. There is an illusion in Richard's illusion that as long as a little stop, the entire square will tilt, and the clean and mirror-like ground will have nothing to grasp. He will helplessly and desperately slip off the square and fall into the bottomless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When standing at the door of the temple, Richard’s heart almost jumped out of his chest and his breathing was extremely difficult. Finally, he was relieved, remembered his mother’s jealousy and looked up into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple has no dome, but is surrounded by a tall stone pillar like a white jade. The center is an altar, and three vague goddesses stand around the altar. They have different postures and different intervals. There should be six statues of the goddess on the edge of the altar, representing six different abilities. The more the goddess that Richard can see, the more he can motivate him in enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard’s memory is outstanding, and he quickly recognizes the power of the three goddesses. It is the 'extraordinary power' that can give the powerful power of the enlightened; the ‘life torrent’ that has strong vitality and the ability to perform healing; and the ‘wind speed’ that increases speed and agility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was slightly disappointed. In fact, he had already had a choice in his small mind, which is the ‘wisdom’ that greatly enhanced his intelligence. Because real men need wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is good to have three choices, and mom is only looking forward to having more than one choice. In fact, what Yi Lian did not say to Xiao Licha was that most of the people who had received enlightenment saw an empty temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Li went to the altar while trying to open his eyes and want to see wisdom. But this temple, together with the entire starry sky, is not real. How can he work hard and see what? Instead, because of hesitation and shaking, even the three goddesses began to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want more power?" A voice suddenly sounded in Richard's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Li was shocked and looked around, but did not see anything. The sound was sudden, and the machine was monotonous, full of metal cold and unintentional taste, making him feel very scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...who are you?" Richard was brave and shivered. His voice swayed back and forth in the hall, and he was shocked by the echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is not important to me, I will not appear in the future. Strictly speaking, I am the other half hidden in your heart." The voice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Xiao Li snarled. My mother said that his heart is very pure and there will not be all sorts of messy things. And after talking a few words with this voice, his timidity gradually subsided. The children in the mountains are very brave. At first they were afraid, just because he didn’t know what happened and he didn’t care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that voice is not affected by Richard at all, saying in a constant tone: "Now, choose what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of Richard, the altar shines again, and there are three more goddesses! In addition to ‘wisdom’, there is also the ‘ element affinity’ that is crucial on the magical path. This ability makes it easier for the mage to communicate with outside elements and cast magic with less effort. Intuitively, a magician with an ‘Elemental affinity’ talent can have one or three more spells than a sibling. This is a horror talent that shows the power of the more advanced. The other ability is the 'natural messenger', which can make people have a more intuitive and thorough understanding of nature, not only can greatly improve the ability to hide and travel in complex terrain, but also the power of all kinds of natural spells. At the same time, it is more resistant to toxic substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, all six inspirations have been placed in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." Richard had already opened his mouth and couldn’t speak. There was a chaos in his little head, and he couldn’t understand what was happening in front of him. The only reasonable explanation is that everything he sees is an illusion. Otherwise what else? This can be different from what the book said and the mother said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Richard did not forget the purpose of the trip, so he shivered and reached out and went to the statue of God who represented ‘wisdom. In the face of the goddess of more than a dozen meters, the little Richard can only touch the feet of the goddess. This is also part of the meaning of the ceremony, leaning over the feet of the goddess, representing a humble attitude. When Richard's hand touched the statue, a sudden burst of sound suddenly sounded in his consciousness, and the whole world seemed to become more real and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wisdom can make people see the world more clearly." This is a sentence in the Holy Scriptures, and now Richard finally realized the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard touched the image of wisdom, all the goddesses disappeared at the same time. It stands to reason that this is the end of the enlightenment ceremony, but the temple has not disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrily looked around and suddenly saw a new statue of God appearing in front of the altar. Her look is crossed with her hands on her chest, her face slightly sideways, her face melancholy and focused. Unlike other goddesses, this statue does not have the slightest texture, but is more like a shadow. Is this also an ability? Richard’s hard-working memories, but I can’t remember what the goddess represents. Even in the Holy Scriptures, there is no record that the goddess of the moon has had this form, although she is indeed the image of Ailsia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't want to have more than one ability?" The voice rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that ability?" Richard paused and said loudly, "I don't want to give up wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call it real. It allows you to observe the world from another perspective, and at the end of this road, you may see something else."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other things? What is that?" Richard asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is silent and there is no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to leave, he now knows that as long as he thinks, he can get out of here and return to the real world. This temple is actually a world built by ritual power. Its role is to let talented people see their abilities and choose the path of the future. But on the other hand, the world is not completely illusory. The temple floating in the sky is filled with the power of the goddess, and the acquisition of all six abilities is inseparable from the care of Ailsia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the voice that appeared in Richard’s consciousness, and the seventh image that was never recorded in the Holy Scriptures, completely overturned Richard’s cognition. Richard suddenly had a feeling that this...much like the temptation of the devil. But how can the power of the devil appear in the sacred ritual of the goddess of the moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the seventh statue, Richard really hesitated. Two different voices are being debated in his consciousness, no matter how high. Take, or not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and struggled, but he stepped toward the seventh statue. "The world is balanced, and all gains come at a price." Richard remembers that the Holy Scriptures have such a teaching, and balance is one of the cores of the teachings of Aussie. So what is the price of the second ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy was lost and struggling for the first time, but in the end, he still extended his hand to the god. Mom said that he can choose according to his own ideas, and he is not willing to give up this opportunity, and is ready to pay the price. Little Richard has the courage to fight for the unexpected harvest. And he is smart. He knows the depths of his mother. He hopes that he will become a hero, a really important big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
