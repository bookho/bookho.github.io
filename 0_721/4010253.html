			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge portal on the territory of a Joseph family at the border of the Holy Alliance It has been built, but in the center of the magical array that supports the portal, there is also a pair of flesh wings, not knowing whether it belongs to the devil or the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a knowledgeable magician here, you will be shocked. Because this pair of seemingly ordinary flesh belongs to a big devil named Mirage. They have the ability to tear and shuttle space, and the source of power is on the flesh behind. And this pair of flesh can actually support the transmission of tens of thousands of troops, from the power point of view it is likely to belong to a devil lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a fleshy wing is a priceless treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the operation of the magic array, the flesh and blood on the flesh is gradually drying up, and the essence of the power is extracted by the transmission array, sent into the channel of the plane, and continuously strengthened. The passage. A team of armed fighters are following the commander's password and stepping into the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One team reloaded the infantry, reloaded the knight, lightly loaded the infantry, cast the archer, the dragon gun heavy infantry, the mage square, one after the other into the portal, and finally It is a full fifty rider! This batch of knights has different armor styles and can be seen as belonging to four families. The last to enter the portal is Raymond and the Sanctuary and the Great Magisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing missing from this army is the pastor. The pastor and the priest are absolutely afraid to walk into the temporary passage without the protection of the lighthouse barrier. When they pass through the plane, they will perturb the time volatility that is much stronger than the ordinary warrior. The higher the level, the more likely it is to cause the faces of the planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mighty army entered the portal, the fleshy wing was absorbed and cleaned, leaving no skeleton left. As soon as the flesh of the flesh disappeared, the portal immediately became unstable, and after a violent glare, the portal was completely destroyed. The return of tens of thousands of troops and many powerful people has been cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle room of the floating island, the old Joseph and several VIPs watched the magic images transmitted back, for a long time. Even if they are sitting in the giants, this army that never goes back is a gamble for them. It's just the value of the Faro plane, and the elimination of a terrible opponent who is growing. This kind of harvest is worthy of gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they have done all the preparations they can make, and the other end of the portal should be Richard’s forward base. As long as the army can successfully capture the base, they will almost stand. Invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard on the floating island suddenly sat up from the bed! He originally wanted to take a nap for a while, and suddenly his heart suddenly felt agitated, feeling a strong uneasiness, so he suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the bed, and everything was calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows in from the open floor-to-ceiling windows, with the unique atmosphere of Faust, always just so warm and moist, there is no trace of the seasons, as if this legend The time of the city is stopped. The smoky moon-like ray of light shines on the floor of the room, replacing the faint golden glow that shines there before the break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already night, but the uneasiness in my heart is getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie look at the time, it’s only ten o'clock in the evening, but he has no intention of continuing to sleep, but gets up in his cloak and walks quickly to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the window of the study room and looked out. The floating island was shrouded in pale purple light. There were occasional people passing by on the road, and everything was calm. At the floating island transmission array, a group of colored lights flashed, and someone is coming out of the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard suddenly felt a sense, looked up and looked into the night sky, and saw countless times of light and light lingering into a light group, Zhengji Speeding up here, he flew straight to the window of his study. Richard only had a slap in the face, and the light group was close enough to see the face of Nolan’s great official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan explained the matter in a few simple sentences, and Richard suddenly changed his face and lost his voice: "Is the coordinates of the Faro plane leaked?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calmed down, he did not speak, and started to walk back and forth in the study. After a while, he looked up and he recovered from the shock at this time. He was so sinking that he could not see any emotional fluctuations. He didn't say anything extra, just plainly said: "Okay, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the old-fashioned Nolan secretly admire, She did not say much, waiting for Richard to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nolan Grand God, do you think, how much time do I have to prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nolan sank and said, "You have at least one full day, and if you are lucky, there may be a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said "My enemies seem to have been preparing for a long time and will not give me a month. One day, good, enough for me to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nolan nodded and said, "Well, then I will go back to the temple first. In the future, I must strengthen the guards of the Dragon Temple! Those derelict Knights of the Temple will be punished!" Later, Nolan’s voice was already brought. A murderous. Not to mention the future of Richard, now is the cooperation between the two sides, each Noland has reached millions of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard smiled and said: "No need! The leak of the coordinates of the plane is a matter of time, and it has been lost until now. It is already very much out of mine." Unexpectedly. If it weren't for me that I didn't have enough strength, I wouldn't put the portal in the Temple of Eternal Dragon. I will be alert to the guards in the future, and there is no need to punish them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looks a little slower and says, "Okay, but the knight on duty will still be punished, but I will fully consider your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Nolan’s figure and went away in the night sky, then left the study room and hurried to the military camp outside the castle, and sent someone to ask Nyris and Agamemnon to go to the floating island immediately to discuss a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers of Richard stayed in the military camp, and at this moment they received the order that Richard issued in consciousness, and all got up. When Richard rushed to the barracks, they were all neatly arranged and waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to Faro first and mobilize all the troops there. We may have a big problem. I will come later. Oral, you Go to Green Forest and transfer all the knights there to Faro. Don't worry about the transfer fee! Right, Tiramisu, you pick all the mighty fighters to look at the storeroom, no matter what enchanted weapons there. Equipment, can bring with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of orders, followers immediately scattered. And Richard went to the study and was ready to wait for the arrival of Nyris and Agamemnon. In important matters, the two of them have always been very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the corridor, Richard saw cocoa again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha adults..." Coco bravely stopped Richard, with a faint blush on his face, obviously dressed up carefully, cute There is a bit more flattering in the pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his brow and said coldly: "Cocoa, is there anything? If it doesn't matter, just wait for me to come back next time. I am now There are urgent matters to deal with!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the urgent words, Coco suddenly cringed and shook his head and said, "No...nothing important. Things, you...you are busy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then walked past her and went straight upstairs. Now Richard's study, the war room, and the above floors are not cocoa free to enter and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Nyris and Agamemnon appeared in Richard’s study almost simultaneously. Nyris was sleepy, apparently called from the bed, so when sitting across from Richard, he looked mad and couldn’t tell the cute and charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard is not in the mood to appreciate his beautiful enchanting, and bluntly said: "I just got the news, the coordinates of the Faro plane leaked, and The Eternal Dragon Hall detected the spatial fluctuations leading to Faro, and it is likely that my enemies have begun to send to Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris was shocked and said: "Faro? Isn't that your nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. So this time the enemy is not very simple, actually went straight to my core The area." Richard's eyes narrowed, inadvertently revealing chill. "It seems that they feel that the Greenson plane can't satisfy their appetite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon frown at the same time. When Richard slammed the battle book with Schumpeter, he designated the Greenson plane as a battlefield. It was a private plane of Gordon, and it was taken from the Bear Peter family. So in a symbolic sense, It is Richard's private territory to hold members of Archimonde as the owner of Archimonde. Now, the other side directly uses Richard's private plane to use the soldiers. It is obvious that it has not only been planned for a long time, but also a precursor to the comprehensive aristocratic war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris fell on the arm of the sofa and shouted: "This is not a trivial matter! Richard, you are a royal builder, qualified to receive royal The help, the attack on you is equivalent to the attack on the royal family to some extent! I will help you apply, mobilize the guardian corps of the father to the Faro plane to help you defend! No matter how many people come from, Let them come to a dead one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a temporary delay, I can't help but say it." Richard shook his head and refused. He still has too many secrets in the Faro plane and does not want the royal family to know. In addition, the royal garrisons are easy to come in, and it is difficult to send them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of Nyris is not high enough to command the Guard. Therefore, even if the application is approved, the collaborators that Richard will face are also the generals sent by the royal family, not Nyres. The best result is to sign a joint development agreement and get a certain percentage of follow-up benefits, but it will never be as dominant as the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you need us to do?" Agamemnon asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to withdraw all my defensive forces that I personally invest in the Greenson plane. Before the Faro problem is resolved, I may not be able to defend the Green Forest. This requires you to increase the power of Greenson and maintain the situation there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
