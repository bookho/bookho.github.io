			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can withstand the baptism of superimposed fireballs without loss, only from the material, this A book page is a valuable treasure. Moreover, the Temple of Courage closed the door and solemnly and secretly engaged in a ceremony. Regardless of the purpose of the ceremony, it should be related to the book page placed in the center of the Magic Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has no idea, he grabbed the pages from the altar and smashed it into his arms. However, as soon as he let go, the page suddenly bounced off and returned to its original shape, leaving no creases on it. This book page is more than double the book of the Time of Sands. It is even bigger than the sacred scripture of the Moon that Richard saw when he was a child. It is not good to carry it without folding it. Richard was helpless and simply rolled it into a roll, which was able to get into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard ran out of the temple, the battle of the Knights Templar was nearing the end, and you could hear the iconic howl of Gangde in the distance. Under the thirsty axe, the Knights of the Temple became similar to the reptiles, and the scorpions were even less fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it at first glance, and the first thing that broke into the line of sight was Gangde, who was on the battlefield that seemed to be somewhat deserted. The power of the obstacles is much stronger than the combat power shown in the previous times. His muscles are bulging, and the light is faintly revealed. Apparently, he has already launched the power of blood and the power of the earth. The attacking power and the defensive power have been significantly improved. Even though the heavy weapons of the Knights of the Knights are actually cut to the iron-like body, Only a deep wound can be left behind. And the hunger-hungry axe slashed, swayed, and swayed, and almost no one could resist the three axes. This is the battle of Gangde’s real power. When he moved forward to the base, he struggled with Sir Mintel, who was far above his strength, and his opponents were too weak. In fact, there was no place for him to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres are also slaughter machines. They don’t need extra special abilities at all, and their power is enough to make their opponents desperate. Especially the three-point cooked with heavy armor, it is more like a fortress built by moving steel. The opponents are those knights who have rushed out of the station. They just got up from the bed and didn't even have a complete set of weapons. Some even didn't get the weapons of the pickpockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the three killing machines, the unprepared shrine knights were completely the object of the slaughter, the big axe and the heavy hammer cheered and slammed into these without any protection. The meat/body is simply enjoying the feast of blood and meat, and each wave will bring a large piece of blood and fragments of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining knights realized that outside the camp was a killing trap, re-retracing back into the camp, trying to use the terrain to wrestle, at least for the robes to wear equipment time. But Splash and Olal also arrived. The power of the Elf poet may not be strong, but the battle in a complex environment is never a girl's world. As for the enemies, they are not prepared enough to even face a fast beast alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even with such a one-sided battle, the final victory is still difficult. The fighting power of the Knights of the Temple is far more than the Baron's army, not because of the level of power, but because they are not dying, even if they are in desperate circumstances, there are many people who want to hold the enemy and finally take a bite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle at the temple was over, Gangde and Tiramisu had a lot of injuries, and even the watery thighs were cut deep. Deep wounds. Even with the presence of drifting sand, there was still a serious attacking knight, and the fast beast also died at both ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the results of the battle, count the six knights who had been settled in the temple before, and all the 30 knights of the temple were killed. Nearly one hundred were obeyed and died. Big and multiple injuries can't afford to be lost, but the loss of fighting spirit will surrender but only five or six people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Knights Templar station is over, and the sands are released like a stream of water. Finally, the life of the severely wounded knight is saved in a stable and escaped stage, and the wounded legs of the water will not be left with disability and scars. Although she is at least equivalent to three priests of the same rank, she is too tired to look after all the injuries have been dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already visited the battlefield, and is deeply shocked by the unexpected tragic war, especially for the knights and the shackles in the desperate order People are awe-inspiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his original calculations, the knights of the ranks between the ** level are not a threat, especially this battle is still a surprise attack, get up from the bed The knights have no armor. Although the magnificent and complicated body armor of the Knights of the Temple is outstanding in defense, it takes at least half an hour to wear it neatly. Knights with heavy armor and no heavy armor are completely two occupations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the final result of the war was far beyond Richard’s expectations. If there are not the powerful fighters of Gangde, Shuihua and Ogre brothers who are chasing the jazz, and the sharks of the gods, it is almost impossible for the war to be undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there has been a war damage, if the fast beast is also considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the side of the flowing sand, watching the Knights of the Temple with different postures and almost no body, Richard sighed deeply and said: "This is a bit of a hard fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's normal, they all have faith." The sand is weak and standing unsteadily, so simply Relying on Richard, and then plainly said: "The people who really believe are not tired, do not feel pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle subsided, and the corner was restored to silence. The flame of the torch tower was extinguished except for the fist of the courage of the Holy Emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People awakened by the alarm are mostly hiding from home and closing the doors and windows. Although the baron's homeland has not been attacked by foreigners for more than a decade, as a port city where various news gathers and material circulation, people have long learned to control the curiosity that should not be. The general public is looking forward to the protection of the garrison, while the garrisoners scattered in all corners of the city are counting on the assistance of the Baron's elite guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the baron castle on the high upstairs put up the suspension bridge as soon as the battle started, put down the gate, clearly stated the strategic direction with practical actions, and strictly guarded against it. The meaning of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, in the garrison camp in the north of the city, hundreds of garrison troops were formed in succession, armed one by one, responsible for the security of the city. The knight is sitting in the main building of the barracks. However, he did not mean to send troops. He just said that he would wait, wait a second, wait for more garrison troops to gather, and wait for more news to be collected. Anyone who suggested that they should go to the temple as soon as possible was sent to the shrine by the sealed knight to scout the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few batches of people who came back, who came back, could not return, so no one made any similar suggestions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the garrison of the military camp has approached two hundred people, it has been more than an hour since the alarm bell of the temple has been ringing. The direction of the temple suddenly ignited an open flame, quickly becoming a raging fire, smog and sky, illuminating most of the port city. Baron Fossa stood on the top of the castle and looked at the temple that was being swallowed up by the flames. His face was cloudy and uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and others have reunited in the square in front of the shrine, this time there are dozens of horses, some of which are immediately armed with bundled armor weapons. Waiting for the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
