The sand people are naturally the masters of Xiangma. They quickly took away more than forty top horses and walked away. The ogre and barbarians also followed the rapid into the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, another piece of flying axe was thrown, this time to the remaining horses. Then three consecutive fireballs fell into the horse's circle. The power of the three fireballs was not too big, and the coverage was very wide, almost half of the horses were included. The flames rolled past and lit the bristles of dozens of horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, seeing the direction of the horse ring ignited a raging fire, Richard knew that the raid troops had succeeded, so he gave all the connected people in consciousness. The retreat order. A long whistle sounded in the night, so all the soldiers in the camp did not fall in love, and immediately returned to retreat, and they were evacuated in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the fence, the twilight is running fast with the help of terrain and shadows, suddenly stopping, and a Viscount's warrior is just in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight is breathing sharply, it is a new life after all, and the short-term killing makes it consume more than half of its power. The soldier smirked and approached, his eyes suddenly fell on the twilight neck, where the skin was white and delicate, clearly a beautiful woman! His breath immediately rushed, his eyes down, and he saw the twilight chest bulging slightly. Although the twilight wrapped his body in a dark robes, the curves of the bumps could not be covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current ability of all colors of the twilight is not enough energy to use. In its field of vision, it has been detected that it is a six-level veteran, which is fatal to it. Threat. Seeing the veteran's gaze moving, the twilight suddenly reached out and pulled the wrapped robes out of the line, revealing a long body from the neck to the navel. The bare/exposed parts are all delicate and snowy skin. It seems that nothing under the robes is worn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran’s eyes did not feel sluggish, and the twilight was thrown into his arms like a piggyback. The veteran had not figured out what to do, and felt a slight pain in the abdomen. Then a heavy numbness came from the wound, and the entire abdomen lost consciousness in a blink of an eye. He suddenly bowed his head, only to see the front end of the left arm of the twilight is not a hand, it is a blade! The blade has all fallen into his abdomen at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran still wants to struggle, the right hand of the twilight has been lifted, his leather armor is opened, the left hand blade is cut, the ribs of the veteran are cut off, and then The right hand from the wound penetrated into the wound, holding the heart that was still beating, and grabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯拉拉下罩, a few mouths to swallow the heart, and then rushed outside the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running a few steps, it suddenly stopped, and the eyes that were exposed outside the mask began to flash and searched for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blade of silence rested silently on the neck of the twilight, letting it stop all actions immediately. There was a cold and blunt sound in his ear: "Don't look for it, I am here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色# Start, then slowly turn back, seeing the double eyes of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you?? What is the relationship with Sinclair?" asked the coldly. She did not see the birth process of the twilight, only knowing that there was such a follower suddenly around Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
