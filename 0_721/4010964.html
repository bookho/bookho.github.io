			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the palace has finally opened, and there is no fixed voice from it: "The turbidity, take my clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already ready, squat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity brought in two sets of clothes, in addition to the uniforms often worn, there is also a set of men's gowns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no orientation of the Master’s robe, and a purple fire immediately burned it clean. She glanced at the turbidity, and said coldly: "Don't do boring things next time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity smiled and said: "I just want to kneel down. In addition, your Majesty, you have such a happy event, are you going to celebrate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing snorted, cold: "You see what I am now." I know that I lost. Is this also going to be celebrated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not invincible in the world, and occasionally losing once is a big deal. But I think, you It’s not easy to meet someone who doesn’t hate it. You need to celebrate it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing surprisingly no anger, but to Faust I glanced at it, and God was so complicated that I finally sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and said to the turbidity flow: "Put it in advance, let's find someone to rebuild it here. Also... The news of my defeat does not have to be concealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of the indefiniteness surprised the turbidity. But he did not argue, but squatted and said: "If you wish, kneel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, Richard has been sent back under the mountain In the camp. He changed his clothes, still an ordinary mage robe, and then led the followers and the knights to start climbing the miracle peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the plank road has already been emptied, and all the people who want to go up and down the peak are stopped at both ends, witnessing the moment when Archimonde returns to Faust . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood in front of the plank road and looked up at the city of wonders after the clouds. Suddenly he felt heartfelt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene where he and the demon King Modred climbed along the path, as if it happened yesterday. Now that the plank road is still there, it is already a human being. He sighed, stepped forward, and embarked on the magnificent avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, Tiramisu, 绯sè, Shuihua, and Zonghu, followers of four legendary realms, and the temple of Caledon The sea went on in order. Then, it was the thousand-riding knights led by Oral and Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally stood in front of the door of the floating world, Richard looked up at the head of the dragon dragon Dala, and stared quietly. The magic dragon's eye shines, and it seems to be watching Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyelids of Li’s eyes, he glanced deeply at the Dragon Dragon, and then walked into the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes up the road, the end is the eternal dragon temple. The roads are crowded with people watching the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no ordinary people who can live in Faust. When people see the structure of Qianqi, they know that the shock is not what words can describe. Some people have secretly ridiculed the many floating islands on the facade of an Archimonde, but they did not dare to fight. At this time, I saw Richard’s construction of the iron ride, only to know that the giants’ retreat is justifiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the major floating islands, the news of the undecided defeat has also spread. Although no one in the royal family saw the battle between No. and Richard, but the news came from the turbidity, there would be no leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the big man got the news, he just sat quietly. In just a few minutes, his hair was already white, and the whole person was old. year old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words before the night of the night seemed to still echo in his ear: "We must face reality. The reality is that Richard and his Akmen Germany has far surpassed us. The Jagged family has since ceased to be the first giant of the Holy Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but until the news of the indefinite defeat For a moment, the Iron Man is still reluctant to admit this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is naturally a veteran legend, and has cultivated outstanding younger generations such as White Night and Agamemnon. The strength of the Jagged family has been growing at a steady rate and unshakable. He did this, but he still couldn't stop the Jagged family from losing the throne of the first giant in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the position of the Iron Man, this level, he is more concerned about how history will judge him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the floating islands are mostly lost, and a few such as Mensa and Turan are completely panicked, but they can’t do anything, they can only wait quietly. Richard’s ruling. In this respect, Richard has never had a reputation for tolerance, and no big aristocrat has a similar reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Old Mensa was in a state of extreme depression, suddenly laughing like crazy, the followers and the elders were extremely surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa did not let them lie in the drum, but said loudly: "珞琪! We have Qi Qi! We can find her and let her be our Tell me a good word!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders suddenly realized that they immediately relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi’s position in Archimonde has steadily climbed, and she has mastered the entire construction workshop. It can be said that it is now the most heavily relied on by Richard. One of the core figures. Although Qi Qi had already announced that he had broken off all relations with Mensa, everyone is willing to believe that blood is thicker than water, and Qi Qi will not look at the family's demise at the source of his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Qi Qi’s not only the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Duke of Turan was angry and mad, and took his sons and elders to a bloody sprinkler, and then ordered them to be the most girls in the family. They all gathered together and singled out one of the best ones to send to Richard. Although it is a bit late to try to emulate Mensa now, it is better than not doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Joseph, he is now like a real old man, and he is no longer the Duke who can fight with Gordon in the past. When the news of the indefinite defeat came, he was sitting in the garden drinking tea. After reading the news, he continued to drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the reaction of the floating islands, it is not within the scope of Richard’s concern. He has embarked on the long ladder of the Eternal Dragon Temple. Nolan was waiting there, and the other three great gods behind her stood in a row, and even hope was respectful. They have heard about Richard’s direct expulsion of the chief priest in the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they can still be high above, then this thing obviously makes them know their true status: in fact, it is optional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in front of Richard, they have no arrogant qualifications. The enormous power of the gods accumulated by Richard is endless, that is, they can be beaten down, and they can be swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here." Nolan greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her god is complicated, and after Richard’s departure from the Holy Alliance, her rì is naturally not very comfortable. Fortunately, with the power of the heads of the gods, she can maintain her position. In addition, after being taught by Richard, the hope also converges a lot, which makes Nolan safely spend this period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Nolan and smiled and said, "I said, I will definitely come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan sighed and said, "Yeah, I didn't expect you to come back in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best way "No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ceremony is ready, come in. To end the sacrifice, you will complete the blood journey." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and followed Nolan into the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient tradition of blood journey, the final step is to offer sacrifices to the Eternal and Time Dragon, and then pray for God's grace and unblock the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the last time there was a floating island unblocking was a hundred years ago, when the royal family unblocked the floating island and then moved. Since then there has been no new floating island unblocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever a new floating island giant appears, the sacrifice simply becomes a ritual. Most of the giants are also relying on strength to compete for the floating island position. The last time Richard took the title of a floating island by virtue of his sacrifice, it was considered an alternative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the altar, Richard placed a top sacrifice on the altar. It is a strange metal used by a legendary powerhouse to redeem points. Richard also couldn't figure out its purpose, but after identification, he knew that it was the equivalent of the top sacrifice, so he took it for sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
