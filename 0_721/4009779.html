			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the reloading knights of Kailan and Kay De. Kellan is on the right side of Richard, and the shadow is just on her way. However, like Gotton, she turned a blind eye to this sudden existence, and often urged the ride to maintain an unhurried pace. So the next moment, the horse's iron hoof is stepping on the black shadow! The only thing that can be seen is the two front hooves raised by the horse. At the moment of leaving the ground, a layer of flames is ignited. Apparently, Kailan has added a vindictiveness to the horseshoe. If this step is hit, it is no less than her full strength. one strike! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows are not easy to shoot, but the knights under Gordon are not afraid to open any obstacles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness persisted for a moment, but it was still lightning-fast retreating as the iron hoof would step on the top of the head, and then disappeared into the darkness. He eventually did not dare to attack, did not dare to fight back, only to back. When the black shadow left, Richard suddenly felt that the trees on both sides of the road were quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team walked forward less than a hundred meters, a sudden hoof from the road ahead, a team dressed in royal knights, the first The knight saw Gotton far away and immediately said loudly: "Gordon, I took the order of the emperor and escorted you to the eternal dragon temple to hold a sacrifice ceremony!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Royal Knight appeared, Richard knew it was safe. But the beginning of that road still has to go by yourself. If you can't rely on your own strength to come to this intersection, then this team of royal knights will never appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams pay tribute to each other, then all dismount, walk the last distance to express the piety of the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two rows of young and beautiful girls standing in front of the temple. The pale yellow high-necked robes make them look elegant and holy. These girls are the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple. As the gods increase, the ranks will go up along the pastor, the sacrificial priest, and the priests until they climb to the great priest who rules the entire dragon temple. The eternal and time dragon favors beautiful women, which is already an open secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Knights stopped at the door and the team of the Archimonde family continued to move forward. Among the heavily armed knights, one big and one small The box and the Richard wearing a magician's gown are particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepping into the door of the temple up to 20 meters, the scene in front of Richard’s eyes suddenly changed, and he was in a desert. Looking at the exhibition, there is no limit to the horizon. It seems that even the horizon does not exist. The sky seems to be a continuation of the gravel on the earth, but it seems that it has been ground into a fine powder and covered with a dome. There are several broken stone columns between the sand dunes in the vicinity, which are full of traces of wind and sand erosion. From the outside, the Eternal Dragon Hall covers an area of ​​about one square kilometer. However, the interior of the Dragon Hall is not even the exact talent of Richard, and it is impossible to accurately calculate the desert and ruins of the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central position of the field of vision, there is a ruin of the temple that has collapsed most of the temple, only from the remains of the remaining stone pillars still need to look up, half-blocking still magnificent rock Go back to the wall and think back to the prosperity and glory of the temple. In the center of the ruins there is an equally broken stone platform, where the sacrifice to the Eternal and Time Dragon is sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so pale gold bands flew from all over the desert, gathered in front of the team into a huge hourglass, and then the hourglass broke, from which a temperament was sacred And the majestic woman. She wore a white robe, a three-legged crown, and a light gold scepter in her hand. The gown and the crown are decorated with golden complex patterns, revealing a rich and desolation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gotton stepped forward and bowed: "Respected Vatican's great priest, this is Richard, my son, and this time the sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vanlin smiled and nodded. Her smile is beautiful and gentle, but with the indifference and detachment that does not belong to the human world, there is a kind of standing in the crowds of life to overlook the taste of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest looked at Richard and smiled and said: "Lucky child, I hope that your loyalty will satisfy the supreme eternal and the dragon of time. The ceremony has been All are ready, I am going to the altar to wait for you. When you are ready, you can come to me and start the ceremony." After that, the great god officer walked down to the altar with a light golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare?" Although Richard temporarily made up the process of sacrifice, he did not know what to prepare in addition to the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon laughed and slammed his shoulder and said: "There is nothing to prepare, even the same sacrifice, different people to offer The sacrifice will have different results, so the kid, everything depends on your own luck. Ah! Yes, there is one thing I forgot to tell you, because Archimonde has its own floating island, so after the sacrifice, eternal time and time The Dragon will ask, how to distribute the gift between the family and yourself. Remember, answer all to yourself! Ok, go! Kid, good luck!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard dragged two boxes and walked to the altar in the middle of the desert. Although there was a floating effect, the weight of the devil and the devil was really not light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard’s standing, he couldn’t help but look around. Only standing in front of the altar can you truly feel the desolateness and vicissitudes that have been carried for a long time since ancient times. There is no beginning and no end. More and more prosperous will wither and decay in the years, and it will only be coveted by future generations. Ruins of the. But why not renovate it here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have seen through the doubts of Richard’s heart, Vatican’s great sage said softly: “Children, all the eternal and timeless dragons, the real temples are such ruins. And it can never be repaired. Even if we build a luxurious hall here and set up a powerful magical array, when the sacrifice begins, all the human traces will be completely smashed by the torrent of time. Nothing can resist the time. Erosion, even if it is a miracle, will only become the scene in front of you when you experience the transition of the endless era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your teaching." As soon as Richard’s heart moved, he seemed to have realized something from it. He was slightly in the body, just like the teachers in the dark blue often asked, “What should I do now?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prepare your sacrifice first." Vatican commanded, seeing that Richard opened two boxes by the altar, and couldn't help but smile with her indifference, saying: "The big devil's Skull? Rare sacrifice. This is... actually evil The heart of the lord! It is a lucky child. Then let's start the ceremony now, the heart of the demon lord can't be put too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin Da Shenguan hands Crossing the chest, facing the altar, bowed his head slightly, devoutly and thoughtfully mourning the long and mysterious spell. As the syllables of the mantra spit out one by one, the pale sky of the gods began to fall in the sky of nothingness, as the golden rain began. The desolate and mysterious atmosphere emerged from the void and gradually spread. Gradually, the sky went dark, and finally lost the meaning of color and turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after completely escaping the emptiness of time and space, it slowly shows a cosmic world full of vitality, countless shining stars, completely different The laws of the world are running. At first, Richard began to curiously try to recognize and touch the meaning of the gods. In the end, he was completely drawn by the world beyond nothing. As if the whole person was sucked in, he even felt his blood flowing and rushing. It is not the kind of violent spurt when the blood is awakened, but the desire and pursuit from the source of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
