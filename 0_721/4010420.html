			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the sky bridge, Richard is standing still against the cold wind Move, after a while, say: "Go and see the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the confession of the Three Gods before the death, before the history of Shulan’s written records, The gods nest and the temple already exist. No one knows how long their history is. In the process of civilization formation, the Shulan people naturally formed the current power system, which is reasonable and powerful, and has hardly gone through any detours. Later, a strong person discovered the secrets of the temple and the nest, and cracked some of the mysterious characters in the temple, and got a way to become a legend. Shulan also had a legendary strongman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Shulans built the holy city around the temple. They also explored the temple and the nest from generation to generation and tried to decipher the mysterious text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Norlanders entered Shulan, the Shulans knew that there were countless other worlds beside Shulan, and there were many very powerful planes. Once these planes are connected with Hughland, it is the end of Shulan, so although Shulan is not big, it has been a slogan in the past. When Noland first entered Shulan, the first army was in the upper limit. The whole army was annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Gods speak only a small part of what they know, most of their memories are stored in the soul, and they are bound by the soul of the soul. In the exclusive zone, when you need it, Naiyou can extract their memories, but this process will not only cause endless pain, but also cause serious damage to the soul, so it will not be used several times, but The soul can slowly be nourished and repaired in that zone. This means that if the soul shepherd is willing, then the captured soul will be restless forever, and this is where the soul shepherd is afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several places in the temple that are particularly important, one of which is naturally the control room where the Three Gods are located. This is the place to control all the functions of the temple, but unfortunately The Shulan people only cracked a very small number of functions. The light of the gods at the top of the temple is one of them. In addition, the opening and closing of a few organs inside the temple is nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha turned around in the control room and looked at every corner, especially the central round table, and finally determined how many Shulan people did not decipher. The method of manipulation, the way the Three Gods use, is to input the special forces cultivated in a special way into the round table to achieve very fuzzy control, and Richard has seen many dragon blood gnomes and elf empire in the dark blue. The alchemy machinery that was handed down during the period, so we can see that this round table must have some special control methods, but the Shulan people can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the control room is the Shenen District occupying a quarter of the top floor of the temple. This is the name that the Shulan people gave it. It is very large in size and is divided into several small areas. The Shulan people only entered successfully. Two of the small areas, the other areas are always dusted behind the metal partition door, do not know what is inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering into the so-called Shen En District, Richard felt as if he had entered the lab of the Schumpeter family, and it was placed along the wall. There is a row of drains, a small part filled with light blue liquid, most of which are empty, each with a transparent lid, and the empty sink lid is open. The sink containing the liquid inside is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few people lying in the closed sink, there are men and women, they are all lying in the sink, they are terrible. The wounds, these people's chests are slightly ups and downs, the heart is still beating, but there is no breathing, although the injuries are extremely heavy, but their vitality is increasing at a very slow speed, there are several people in this group The people, that are some of the sacred strongmen of Shulan, who had been seriously injured in the previous battles. At that time, Richard judged that their injury was that they could not survive for a long time, so they did not send people to chase. But now it seems that they are all likely to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha then raised a little interest in the so-called Shen En District, and continued to look closely, he did not know what happened, since the Dragon Master left, there are always The feeling of embarrassment seems to be uninteresting in everything, but attention is not distracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This temple is full of mystery, obviously belongs to a civilization that is completely different from Noland, and looks even stronger than Noland, at least not Rand's human beings are weak. Such a place is the most valuable place in the exploration of the plane. Richard continues to walk deep into the Shennen District. One of the compartments is obviously more luxurious, if the area is large. There are only three sinks inside, it looks bigger than the outside, and the function is more complete. Both sinks are empty, and only one of them is soaked in a woman's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the smudges on her face, this is a tribal woman, but she is not taller than a tribal woman, but she is even more petite than a human woman. The body has the most perfect proportion. At first glance, it knows that there is explosive power inside, but the surface of the skin is slightly slack. It is obviously soaked in the water for a long time. This woman has a long enough waist side, but The deep wounds, but the deepest part of the wound, but a little bit of bones, but the skin of the wound is a death-like blue-gray, the liquid in the sink constantly nourishes the wound, the flesh and blood continue to grow thin foam, but The flesh of the new born will soon turn blue-gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a powerful body repairing ability in the sink, Richard could not see that the woman's wound had any signs of recovery, and although the woman was still beating, but it was extremely slow, and she gave Richard a strange feeling. Let Richard always think that this is just an empty shell, and the soul is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers also walked into the Shenen District inside, and Senma saw the woman in the sink and immediately whispered: "Daily, she actually still Alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know her." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma looks complicated and says: "This is one of the two legends of Shulan, but it is not a useless guy like Dragon Star. The bloody battle, she dragged Gordon and Modred with all her strength, and actually had the strength to kill the half-team of the knights, even the Gotton adults admitted that this is a terrible woman, if She has the same structure as Nolan's strongman, then our troubles are really big. At the end of the war, she was found to be seriously injured by Modred, but we also had to stop at the mainland. "Bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma recalled the fierce battle of the day, sighed and continued to say: "After her serious injury, we all think she will die. Because Modred’s call to the blood force has the power to destroy the soul, there is no death for the big priests who are above 18th level. The Shulan people have no sacred officials. For many years, the Shulan people have claimed that she is still not dead. We only want to brag because it’s been after the war. However, it was said that it appeared several times, but it did not appear on the front line once, and never participated in any battle. However, she did not expect that she was still alive, but it seems that the soul has already been annihilated, and now only a shell is left. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked over to the sink and carefully observed the body of the day, his face gradually becoming serious, saying: "No, her soul should still be there, this The body is obviously spiritual, and her soul should have left in some way, and has just left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of the people are equally serious, a soul may Nothing can be done, but the soul of the legendary strongman can be difficult to say. Maybe she can be attached to another body, even living in a magical shackle, even if the new carrier power is not strong, but with her deep understanding of the battle. Understand that the same power can be exerted. This temple is so mysterious, and it is obviously biased towards the direction of civilization, which may be hidden by magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
