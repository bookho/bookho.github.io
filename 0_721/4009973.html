			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei urged the horse to chase after Him. Behind him, there are nearly a hundred sand cavalrymen who grow on horseback. The hoofs of hundreds of cavalry at the same time are still enough to shake the earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heim looked at Richard who suddenly caught up, and it was almost impossible to believe that this was the pioneering knight who had been chased by him to almost nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the momentum of Richard’s charge, the general’s face changed immediately. He dropped the viscount and rushed to the back of the team, then whipped up his anger and shouted with a thunderous voice: "The rear infantry is on the ground, the vertical shield, the gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a fairly complete but very thin line appeared in front of Richard. There were no heavy infantry in the Viscounts that had been attacked long distances, and there were no dragons dedicated to the cavalry. Light infantry, unless it is listed as a very strict formation, and blocked with flesh and blood as an obstacle, it will not stop the cavalry assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shamin was originally a natural rider, now armed with the light cavalry lock purchased from the Duke, and then replaced with the top horses robbed from the Viscount, fighting power Immediately rose a full two levels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei slightly slowed down the speed of the horse, riding a samurai rider from his side and rushing to the Viscount’s already chaotic army. That was because the generals issued orders, while the captain of the guard also screamed at the same time, requiring all the shielded infantry to move to the position of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally trying to swallow the squadron’s broken troops. However, at this moment, he saw the enemy’s accidental chaos, and immediately raised his right hand and glanced at it. The blazing flame hits the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the signal of full attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sandmen’s cavalry began to scream and cheered, and they tried hard to push the horses under their arm, and the long and sharp scimitars rose high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! A boring crash sounded, and the infantry who lacked heavy equipment were hit by the sandmen’s cavalry, and the top ten sandmen’s knights were thrown from the horseback, and their horses squatted. Falling to the ground, and sliding forward a long distance under the great inertia, the castration continued to sweep a few unrestrained infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Infantry originally had a complete line that became fragmented a moment ago, and the subsequent Shamin cavalry was able to adjust the direction of the horse in the high-speed impact and was torn from the enemy front. The gap was rushed in, the scimitars swayed, and the snow flicked in the light, flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad of Shamin cavalry rushed into the infantry and began to kill the squad. The original infantry defense line disappeared. Only one point stood like a meteorite in the sandmen. , not moving. It was the general of the Viscount. He was like a black armor at this moment. A huge sword in his hands became an unmistakable weapon in his hands. He would be a warrior with a sandman. Splashing blood has already smothered the armor, and the general thunderous snoring has never been weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard has only a sandman cavalry, then the general will be a hero to turn the tide. However, Richard’s follow-up force has come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few tens of meters away from the general, Richards stopped the war horse, stared at the bloody general, and began to give orders: "Three-point cooked, The front is entangled with him, Tiramisu assists; Gangde, squatting around! Oral, Elf Warsong! Sandru, continuous curse, until success. I will cut off his back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of orders, each of which is pushing the generals down into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre with the heavy axe and he put together strength to not fall into the wind, and the unexpectedly strong brawny behind him is as heavy as a mountain. The power is even greater than the power of the ogre! The general’s two-handed epee blade began to appear more and more gaps, and the weapon that accompanied him for many years now becomes unmanageable, and the power of the curse of the Necromancer begins to take effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost instantly, the generals were surrounded by countless fierce enemies. He is a strongman of the fourteenth level, but all the enemies that surround him have similar combat power. Now that they are rushing, the general knows that he can’t stand for a few minutes. He immediately gave up his intention to break back and was ready to return to his army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he has been paying attention to the investigation of the situation here, seeing the generals move, and immediately took out the book of bearing. After a burst of magical power, the general who directly slammed Gangde desperately saw a violent bear with a full six scalp and thick flesh in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melee, hey! The general's back brain smashed the ogre with a heavy punch, and the huge force directly plunged him into the ground. Then he jumped high and jumped high, and the huge body of hundreds of kilograms sat down to the generals in the millennium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart jumped and hurriedly shouted: “Leave alive!” But this sentence is obviously a bit late, and the bang is loud. The huge ass of the ogre has been crushed on the general! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...." Richard grabbed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fifty throwing soldiers finally arrived, the battle immediately turned sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally ordered them to start using the poisonous bone blade, and a white bone blade instantly covered only the remaining ten reloading knights and rang. The death knell of the knight. The bone blade is heavy and sharp, and it is more powerful than the metal axe. It can cut the knight's plate and hurt the body inside. Although the bone blade can't penetrate the plate armor, it can only leave a serious wound to the heavy-duty knight, but the poison attached to it will only need to reload the knight's life in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second bone-throwing throws a doubling of the number of knights from their way home. If there are enough horses, the reincarnation of these knights should have been a very good light cavalry. The throwing soldiers quickly cast their bones and carrying the five-handed axe, and the result was the most subtle part of the Viscount army. The roaring axe is definitely the nightmare of every warrior. This thing can't even stop the full body of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proper assault ultimately resulted in a complete defeat of the Viscount army. After the general fell, the captain of the Guard escorted the Viscount to escape, and some of the soldiers followed, and the other abandoned soldiers gave up their resistance in desperation and surrendered to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha only left less than ten soldiers guarding more than 300 prisoners, and then the remaining troops were slightly reorganized and chased with troops. The remnant of the Viscount of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit continued for a whole day and night, and Richard was like a wolf who traced prey, always wandering around the prey, and always slammed into a bite. Remove a piece of meat, then continue to fight, then tear off a piece of meat. In the deep mountains behind the village of Rutherland, the devil wolves use this method to hunt farther prey than their own body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscounts who fled the battle and did not find that their route of travel was forced to deviate from an angle by the pursuit of the enemy behind him, and was approaching the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
