			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie look at the wide streets, dense green trees, and well-developed The sewer system, and asked the generals general about tax and population issues, has quickly outlined a financial statement. He noticed almost immediately that the city had too much investment in people's livelihood, and that Ali had almost no money, and on the contrary it was possible to put it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate, Richard suddenly dismounted and carefully studied the deep hoof print on the ground. In countless horseshoe prints, these rows of hoof prints are extraordinarily deep and huge. This is not an ordinary heavy cavalry, but only a horseshoe print left by the knight. The knights are so powerful that they can afford to exceed the heavy armor and heavy weapons of ordinary heavy cavalry. At the same time, their mounts also need special options, which can not be tolerated by ordinary mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s gaze also fell on those hoof prints, and the heart immediately jumped. Even she can see that the hoof prints are still very fresh, no more than an hour at most, can't Richard see it? If Richard has the heart, you don't have to use a fast horse. Just ride a gryphon and you can catch up with Elliott's troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard looked at it for a long time, but stood up like nothing, turned to the horse, said to the general: "Let's go see Barracks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi sighed again, and once again came out with a cold sweat. In front of this, the situation has passed, so that she feels incredible, and then in the bottom of my heart can not help but blame Ellie, how can run so late, if the lion's grade brought by Richard is higher, or not resting on the road Ten minutes, isn't it necessary to block Ellie in the castle? What happened then, Ellie was too embarrassed to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and the generals circled in the military camp, and the general also specially called out a small team of soldiers to perform a set of combat skills. Then Richard was undecided and followed the general to the castle. The management had already waited respectfully and arranged a good room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has proposed to visit Alice’s study, the general has a hard time, but he looked at the eyes of Schi, this time it was a quick response. It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall style of the Aleris study is with a strong Babylonian color, which is one-third larger than the general size, regardless of the table and chair or the bookcase. Decorative carvings can be seen everywhere, but the selection of patterns is not complicated, the lines are smooth and hand-crafted, showing a low-key luxury, very old-fashioned aristocratic style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fly in the ointment is that many of the furniture and decorations here are too new, and the fireplace lacks traces of smoke and fire for years. All in all, the difference between this study and the real giants lies in history and time. And as one of the two most important rooms in the aristocratic castle, the variety of decorations and antiques placed here is far from the standard of true aristocracy, and even the imitation of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study has a whole empty wall with a partial map of the border area of ​​the Holy Alliance, which is marked with the territory of Elliott and the surrounding situation. Richard stood on the edge of the map and looked at it for a while before she walked over to her desk, sitting on the table directly, as she was used to it in her own room, and then turned her eyes to Faschi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi started sweating again, and she never thought that Richard’s gaze would make her feel unbearable. In fact, Richard did not have the power of arrogance, but she was guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "I can see that the count is not rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The count used the money for the development of the territory and the welfare of the soldiers." Faschi admits that this is true, and apart from Sauron and Goliath, which have historical inheritance, Archimonde Not rich, Gordon said that no more than Ellie, do not say personal enjoyment, even the most basic military equipment can not talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put the box containing the seven sets of suits on Ellie’s desk and said, “Then I will stay first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi opened his mouth but couldn't make a sound. She is very aware of the value of this magic box, which is worth nearly 9 million! Such a huge amount of money is the number of times that Ellie’s current territory is plus all the income! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi suddenly felt a soft and weak, and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said nothing, let Faschi take himself back to the room to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard meditated in the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wilderness, Elliott’s soldiers are busy setting up camps, and the generals are working together to make the pre-war preparations more detailed. perfect. Ellie himself was full of irritability, left the camp alone, walked aimlessly, and did not know where to go. Don't say that there is no purpose for walking, even if you don't think about your goal, you will rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything blames the seven sets of damn makeup! Why is it a suit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I said that it was the condition that others could not reach themselves. And even if Richard has this ability, shouldn’t it be so fast? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of packages sent by Richard was said to be a deposit. In fact, she was self-contained but she counted herself to contain Sauron and Goliath, let the floating island The situation is not at the cost of a complete deterioration, so the situation is nothing. But after the seven sets of kits were delivered, the nature changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Liyi was more and more irritated at the thought of the seven sets of makeup, and the heart was even more violent. She suddenly slammed out a fist and broke a thick tree! Feeling the sting of the fist face, she felt better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stars of the sky, Ellie continued to violently dismantle the woods, and Richard was meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard rode on the gryphon, followed by three heads flying into the sky, hovering and heading south to the south. Faschi stood on the ground and raised his figure to a small black spot. He eventually became integrated with the clouds, and could no longer see it. He sighed for a whole day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flight is three days and three nights. Richard almost crossed the small half of the continent, and finally saw the endless sea of ​​waves on the fourth morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, there was a small war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Ellie slashed through the territory of two nobles and stormed into the Duke of Soram. The war came very suddenly, and the Duke of Soram was caught unprepared. In a hurry, he had only had time to mobilize a small army, and Ellie had a decisive battle in the small town of Fura, forty-seven kilometers from the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, Ellie slammed against the erratic style of use, and the Duke of Soram played a rare frontal battle. Although this period lasted for a short time, it was extremely fierce. The overall strength of the Duke of Soram was still dominant, and occupied the main venue shape, but was eventually defeated by Elio's exquisite command. But Ellie also paid a lot of money. Other things, the war-to-loss ratio is the highest in her wars in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
