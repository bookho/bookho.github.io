But the only one who can order their retreat or surrender has fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stationed in the horse, raised his hand, ordered the soldiers to retire to retreat, and then rearranged the heavy shields to form a ring of ring walls. The center of the ring is the last dozen knights. They have already been bathed in blood, I do not know whether it is their own or the enemy. The mounts are already dead, so they stand back to back and face dozens of times the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surrender." Richard made the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the answer is a slobber on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and made the final order in consciousness. A throwing axe roared and smashed in the center of the ring with precision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chama was on the small high ground, silently watching the soldiers under his command to clean the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood has reddened the entire battlefield, and a corpse still maintains its pre-death posture. Odom’s body was lifted out and laid flat on a piece of grass. The armor on his body is covered with sword marks, and there are countless burn marks left after the magic burst. Perhaps the most telling thing about the cruelty of the battle is that he has twenty-three arrows in his body! The magic handcuffs brought back by Richard, within the range of the Sanctuary strong, do not dare to block. Odom used his body to harden more than twenty arrows before he finally fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the priests are the busiest. For many seriously wounded warriors, the priest's magic is the only hope for their lives to survive. The sand and Clark's hands are constantly shining with the magic of the gods, and several fallen priests, even the little pastor Sissour, are constantly being treated. The power of the priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple is fully manifested at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel is still radiant, and the magic seems to be exhausted. He walks among the wounded soldiers, and a piece of sacred radiance is sprinkled from his hands, and countless Looking at him with hope, as if he is a god walking on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s not so pleasing to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the news of the main defeat, Old Hogan immediately turned around and did not hesitate to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost non-destructive Shamin cavalry appeared on the battlefield and began to circulate around this purely infantry team. The horse tactics are played to the fullest. However, Sir Hogan was calm and stable, and the formation was always in chaos. After leaving more than 100 bodies, he finally managed to withdraw the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle with Sir Odom was more intense than Richard expected, and he had to clean the battlefield and let the soldiers rest. Although the combat units of the mother's nest are not afraid of pain, they still fatigue, and the will not always surpass the meat/body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time when Richard returned to Noland, the mother’s nest continued to create humanoid early stage fighters in the turbulent land, and the number actually accumulated to more than 400. There are ten elite warriors. When Richard gave them all the equipment, the combat units immediately became the best for Odom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the soldiers who ambushed on the edge of the turbulent land entered the battlefield, the contrast between the two sides was completely reversed. Richard, who has more than 500 humanoid warriors, a large number of throwing soldiers and two hundred barbarian warriors, has an absolute advantage in combat power, and the contrast between magic and magic power is more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigate the results of the battle, the soldiers under the watch of the soldiers killed more than 100, injured more than two hundred, all the other seven hundred cavalry. In addition to the escape of a few light cavalry, the reloaded knights who were caught in negative magic and steel barriers lost their most valuable maneuverability, almost to the last soldier. On the Richard side, due to the large number of pastors, the supply is sufficient, and the wounded soldiers can fight again in a day or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, although the baronian Xiaofang Dan still has more than a thousand defenders, the main elite has been swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the warriors who fought for a day went into a dream. After Richard made up his magic in his own camp, he began to draw the structure. Now he has enough materials on hand and a large number of construction plans, so the constraints are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the magic pen, Richard held his breath and gently outlined the first line on the prepared matrix enchantment. This line is complicated and it is more than three meters long when straightened. It is very difficult to draw a stroke. It is the key to this life's guardian structure, which directly affects the efficiency of extracting free energy around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s hand is as steady as a rock, and the accuracy of the scratch on the tip of the pen has reached one tenth of a millimeter. This is the accuracy that normal people can't achieve at all through training, not to mention maintaining a stable and balanced output of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, this painting is good, this structure is equivalent to one-third completed. He gently lifted this artifact-level magic pen and prepared to change the magic solvent. This pen can hold three kinds of magic potions at the same time, and switch according to the user's mind, and will never affect each other. This invisibly solves a big traditional problem of too much impurity in the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this magic pen, Richard’s heart was warm and he couldn’t help but think of the sand. However, when I think of the sand, I can't help but think of the sun-shining Iyo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the air that had been exhaled had been brought to the fire. He almost judged by intuition that Iowa must be by the sand at this time! So what is he doing there? Where is the sand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to think about it, the sand should now be in its own camp, because all the wounded soldiers have been cured. So, is Iraq and Russia in her camp? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Richard tried to convince himself. But in his heart, there is another gloomy voice saying, "Do you know if you go to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in sand flow!" Richard is in the bottom of my heart. roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know her." The voice didn't give up at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, irritated? Want to prove that I am wrong, just go Didn't she know when she saw it? You are afraid that he is there too, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly silenced and put the magic pen down. Now his mood is no longer suitable for drawing the structure, and definitely make a failure. This is the first time that Richard has been unable to continue working due to emotional reasons. He can increase the success rate without reducing the quality of the material. Failure once means that tens of thousands of gold coins have disappeared. Now every gold coin is very important to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard simply took out the drawings of ‘Life’s swearing’ and started research again. This is a nearly magical structure, not as simple as the ordinary third-order construction. One of the most difficult magic arrays seems to be linked to the same magical array to connect the two structures into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array is difficult to draw, and Richard has never seen it in any third-order standard build. However, it is still difficult to see Richard. If Richard estimates that his status is good enough, he should succeed within five trials. The problem now is that his magic is not up to the requirement of drawing this magical array. It is only possible when he is promoted to fifteenth level and can use eight levels of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the other parts of 'Life is extinct' is also wonderful. Every time I look at it, Richard will be inspired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s not suitable for doing anything tonight. Richard stared at the drawing for ten minutes, but did not see anything. The voice in consciousness repeatedly reminded him: "These times are enough to do a lot of things. If you go now, you have time to stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet Look? Interrupted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't make any difference now. But maybe there will be a second time..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Richard heavily placed the drawings on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's time is destined to be completely abolished here if he does not go out to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the camp, Richard specifically ordered a separate camp for each of the sands, Iowa and Clark. The special treatment of senior priests and mages is a guideline for all planes, so there is no problem on the surface of Richard. Gangde and Oral, who are in charge of the army, have never let him down in the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled that when introducing Iowa, the sand and lips were faint Smile. Now I think back and forth, but it seems that I can taste too much and not to express it. There is never a priest who will manage another priest as a partner. In the mind of Richard, the face of Iowo floated again. The sun-like sacred officer looked at his own eyes, with interest, pride, and faint disdain. But now, in retrospect, Richard saw a deep hidden hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel is a fighting sect, the power seems to be endless, and his battlefield is his paradise. And he is so brilliant, so brilliant, Richard feels in front of him, it seems that the aura of his royal master is suppressed and dull. As for the other, for example, the temperament, there is no need for comparison, and the two are not at one level at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All along, Richard is really frustrated on the outside, there is only one Nyris, one Io. Nyris is truly friendly to Richard, and his appearance is more inclined to be charming and beautiful. But Iowa is different, he is handsome and handsome. Even Richard has to admit that the appearance of Iraq and Russia is fatal to women's lethality. The elf poet Oral and Ioby became a farmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally walked outside the camp. After staying this way, Richard had to drink again, but after drinking, he did not know what would happen. However, at the moment of the account, Richard did not know why he had folded back and grabbed a long knife to extinction before he went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the camp, they met Gangde on the face and almost hit each other. Gangde opened his mouth and just wanted to make a joke. Suddenly, he felt that there was a difference in his look. There was an inexplicable murderousness. He glanced at the joke, but asked: "Head! How to fight tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
