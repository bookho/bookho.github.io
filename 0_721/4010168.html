Although he likes Dafa’s rhetoric, he doesn’t brag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said: "There is only water splashing in the sanctuary. Gangde, you are still almost."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde scratched his head and said, "I am not... anxious to prove something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his head and said, "The gap between you and her is the structure. How do you say this? It is impossible to make up for it for the time being. The secret guide is, after all, my most outstanding achievement so far. But that is Seven configurations, you don't have as many construction positions at all. In terms of carrying capacity, you are not an order of magnitude with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde said: "That's it. Hey! Anyway, bullying a little girl is not a skill, next time I will find a tiramisu fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"成!" The ogre smiled thickly. "When my second head grows out, I will fight with you! Rest assured, it won't take long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde For a moment, I screamed: "You big / Lord /!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Be serious! You will have to master a plane in the future, so now you have to learn how to lead the troops. As for why I am temporarily Let them go, that's because..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the distant 3,000 striker and said, "This fish is too small!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard seemed to be afraid of the powerful army front of the coalition, and gradually retreated, and did not dare to face the coalition. However, the coalition forces did not have any brilliant results. Because there are many infantry in the army of Richard, but the power of the machine is strong, but the generals of the coalition are stunned. They have tried their best to catch up with the main force of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to do this is to let the cavalry leave the brigade alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this proposal has caused a fierce quarrel again at the top of the coalition. The deputy head of the Knights of the Kingdom resolutely disagreed with the division of troops, citing countless cases of the use of soldiers as soldiers, indicating that this is Richard’s conspiracy, he can completely see the coalition’s shadows, but no, the purpose is to The coalition forces divide the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zakuda Magisters coldly threw a stack of papers in front of the deputy head and said, "Our cavalry is gathered together, Seven thousand! And Richard’s current army has only 6,000 troops! Do you use the 7,000 cavalry that is dominated by the Knights of the Kingdom to beat the 6,000-strong infantry? It’s the idiot who can see the huge force on this force. Advantages. If this does not win, is your brain eaten by the pig?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head of the Kingdom Knights is also strong at the 17th level The person, so insulted, a resolute face slowly reddened and turned purple. He suppressed the anger as much as possible, but the voice was still unable to control the trembling: "This is not a problem of military comparison! But this ten is a trap! Richard must have hoped that we will divide."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me tell you, where is Richard’s trap?" Zaku is aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head said: "Li has always wanted to separate our cavalry from the infantry. Once we split up, he will concentrate on the strength of one of the battlefields and encircle our cavalry in one fell swoop!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku exaggeratedly laughed: "You really took him as a god of war! You should look at these things first, then come and talk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deputy head picked up the paper that Zaku had thrown over and glanced at it. The paper lists the current strength of Richard. It is very detailed. Only the newly built 400-person knights in the mother's nest in the last four months have not been listed because they did not appear in Lanshui Oasis City. After the military force, it enumerated almost all the followers of Richard, and the names were followed by the grades and occupations. Of course, there are also the Masters and the Gods. Because their personal ranks are not very impressive, they only indicate the number of people at all levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only looking at this information, Richard really has nothing to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing around him that is worth seeing is Luofu. But the aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom are very familiar with the swordsman. Among the strong people in the sanctuary, his strength belongs to the third-rate. Also a little troublesome is the Viscounts of Heim and the Countess of Ekaterina, but the trouble of both of them is only identity, and it is necessary to stay alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the main force of the Richards army was just a few slaves a few months ago. How much combat power the slave army can have, everyone knows very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See? My deputy head of the sanctuary? You have a full seven thousand cavalry, including two thousand kingdom knights, can't you deal with five More than a thousand original slaves? I really want to doubt how your sanctuary strength came from? Isn’t the so-called kingdom knight, can you only marry a hero on a woman’s belly? Even slaves dare not fight?” Zaku’s The tone is sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head of the whole face is twisted, not even knowing how to endure it without a fist in Zaku’s face. He does not know that Zaku has a very big ambition. The great magister wanted to shine in this war, and replaced his robe with dark gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku spent a huge price striking the position of the commander of the coalition, not just to go through the game. Ryan privately promised that as long as this battle wins, as long as he sits on the throne of the president, Zac will be promoted to the position of vice president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the deputy head is shaking, he has nothing to say. From the intelligence on paper, there is really no reason to win or not, but if the war relies on a few pieces of information, it can be won by paper-based deduction. The sow can be a marshal. However, the deputy head is also very clear why he will participate in this war as a "private" person. In the face of such obvious strength advantage, even if he can ignore Zaku, he can't explain the reasons for not playing against the person behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zakula pulled out the map and said in one of them, "I have calculated in detail, as long as we concentrate all our cavalry, we can To catch up with Richard's main force! There are more than a dozen kilometers around here. Even if Richard ambushes the army outside our reconnaissance range, it takes at least three hours from getting the news to getting to the battlefield. Three hours, are you? Can't you eliminate five thousand slaves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head can't say no, but his instinct is shouting, it's impossible to be so simple! If so It is impossible for Richard to defeat Saranwell with inferior forces. Who is Jarenville? The deputy head of the team has learned that a saranville can play the Masters Association, these masters can not find the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku tried hard on the map and said: "That's it! Gather all the cavalry, and pursue it all tomorrow. Kill the main force of Richard on the sunset plain on the edge of the border! Even if he set up an ambush here, from the notification of the ambush to Entering the battlefield, at least three hours or more, we will beat his time difference, first destroy his main force, then turn over his head to eat his ambush! Each break! Let Richard understand what is the evil of the division!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head looked at the cheers and attachments of the aristocratic generals attending the meeting and knew that they had no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the coalition forces assembled all seven thousand cavalry and began to fully attack the troops of Richard. However, when the two sides contacted, the coalition found that things were not as simple as they thought. The power of the Richards’ army was incredibly high. At a distance of tens of kilometers, the coalition cavalry went straight to the whole day to get closer to the distance that the long-range charge was enough to reach the contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time is already dark, after a day of rush, no matter whether the Cavaliers or the horses have no physical strength to charge. Although Zaku was eager to fight, he had to decide to rest, and only sent reconnaissance cavalry to track the movements of the Richards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacu couldn’t see that under the night, several troops were moving around and marched to the predetermined position before they took a break from the camp. The main force of Richard continued to retreat, and opened a distance of more than ten kilometers before he began to camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look down from the sky, you can see that several of Richard’s troops, such as a spear and a spear, are the sunset plains. There is Richard’s scheduled battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the Midsummer month is destined to be an important day in the history of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sunset plain, Richard’s main force was finally caught up by the coalition cavalry. At the last moment, Richard gave up and continued to escape, posing a strict formation on the plains, facing the enemy who occupied the advantage of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a kilometer, Zaku looked at Richard’s military array and could not help but gently lick the lips that were dry because of excitement and said to the deputy head: Attack it! Fight them once and fight them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy head has hated Zaku, but he has to do his best at the moment. As soon as he waved his hand, thousands of knights in the cavalry strategist slowly descended, posing as a squadron and began to slowly push over to Richard's front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is riding on the unicorn and seeing the opposite movement. He smiles and says: "It’s actually the most elite kingdom knight. It seems This trick will be easier than expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Thousand Kingdoms began to charge when they approached 300 meters, these are all above the seventh level. The elite knight, the rifle in the hand is up to seven meters long and weighs a hundred kilograms. With a full shot, the heavy infantry with the tower shield can penetrate! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when they rushed to the 100 meters, the heavy infantry on the front of the Richard camp suddenly exploded, and hundreds of light-loaded soldiers rushed to the front, they were half-baked On the ground, holding a grotesque weapon in his hand, pointed the rushing kingdom knight with a large muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku smashed and screamed: "Dwarf musket! How can there be so much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; However, Zaku can be described as broad-spectrum, immediately regained his gaffe, and shook his head, saying: "The dwarf firearms are not very powerful, it is difficult to penetrate the king's knight's plate, it is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
