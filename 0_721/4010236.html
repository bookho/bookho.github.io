			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian youth mage suddenly screams with extreme anger! A figure in front appeared like a ghost, and actually stopped at the top of the giant beast, and a pair of long knives in his hand slashed down, deeply piercing the top of the giant beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thickness of the skull of the beast is more than the length of her double-knife, but the double-knife is piercing, and the behemoth suddenly screams! Its eight legs were soft at the same time, and the huge body slammed into the ground, plowing a long deep ditch on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian youth mage lost his god's effort, the prey in his hand was actually robbed by others, and he was infinitely angry. Even more frustrating, it was after seeing the man who shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Night!" The barbarian youth’s snoring echoed around like thunder. "You don't honestly stay in your dusk, what are you doing here?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some shortcomings in the hand, so go to other places, try your luck!" The white night face is fabulous, it seems that it will never laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian youth face cold, his eyes smashed and said: "Then you met me, obviously luck is not very good!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not necessarily! To leave, we haven't played." White nights are opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian youth waved a thunderbolt ball and threw it over, but this ball was not connected to the ordinary sparks before, and the ball was almost inconsistent. Outside, it is blue-blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the electric ball left, the barbarian youth said coldly: "No longer give you a lesson, you still think that the world is big, there is no place where you can't walk." !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mention of white nights, and the slashing of the knife directly has instantly appeared in the hands of the barbarian youth mage! However, it was a blue-blue power grid that greeted her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderstorms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night full body clothes ruptured, squatting back, a short hair all turned black ash. He couldn’t get away from it. He frowned and looked at the wound in his abdomen. Then suddenly his body trembled. The black beast suddenly had seven or eight cracks, revealing the wound underneath the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not say a word, and entangled together! They use magical power, one with vindictive martial arts, but they fight with each other, and the shadows come and go. The most intense time is almost impossible to distinguish the figure, only the blue-blue magic light and the two shiny metal reflections blend together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the light group suddenly went out, the two were separated by a hundred meters, squinting at each other, but they never had the strength to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war is still a tie. The barbarian youth was unwilling to face, and spit out a mouthful of bloody saliva. He said: "You are just lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really strong, he still has to win The night of the night, but did not win, although did not lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night snorted and said with extreme contempt: "If Suther Helen is here, he will never care how good his opponent will be."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be red from the face, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the black behemoth that seemed to be dead suddenly turned up and fled at full speed, and instantly disappeared, eventually disappearing At the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a shot from the forehead, shouted: "Damn, forget that this guy will pretend to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night is also a moment to stay. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a grassland in the wild continent, a man with a beard and a bronzed skin leaned on the huge body of a tyrannosaur. He is not tall and strong, and he is at most medium-sized compared to most barbarians, but his torso is full of power. Seeing his sleepy look is like being the most comfortable bed in the world. The animal skin on his body was badly worn, and some places became shiny, but it was worn on him, just right for his temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ears moved, lazily opened half of the eyes, and then the body moved, as if to want to get up, but eventually it was thick Drowsiness is defeated. He turned over and muttered in his mouth: "Isn't that the agreed person? I don't need to use it at all. Anyway, there are more idiots who have nothing to do. I don't want to play with the mountain and the sea now." Let's talk about it for four years, so sleepy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassland is screaming again, and he falls asleep. The tyrannosaurus that he used as a cushion was originally a tyrant on the continent of Calando, but now he is crouching honestly, and he can’t move. Its simple mind has long been filled with fear, and there is nothing left in the body. It is completely on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the entire continent of Calando, I don’t know how many young barbarians have put down Things in the hands, rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don’t know that the action of blowing the teeth of the beast is like using a red-hot soldering iron in those proud and violent barbarian youths. The buttocks were inserted, and the wild boar teenagers suddenly smashed their hairs, red eyes, nostrils, and then shoveled with hooves, vowed to arch Richard into the mud, and then stepped back and forth several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked on the wilderness of this dark yellow light brown patch collage, his manners were calm and comfortable, as if it was just a small afternoon in his own castle. Spread in the garden, each movement reveals an indescribable rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a travel suit often worn by adventurers. The hood of the hood covers most of his face, revealing only the cut chin and the well-defined lips. The double knives are wrapped in Buri, behind them, the fateful twins are hung around the waist, and on their feet they are wearing a pair of animal boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His footsteps are light and calm, and it seems that the frequency of the move is not very fast, but every time you touch the ground, it will slide far away. Feathering can also be used like this, it is estimated that most magicians have never thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha gradually progressed and remained basically in a straight line. When approaching a group of takins, the frightened takin group immediately began to run wild. They started to take Richard far away, and then Richard gradually followed up, marching side by side with the takin group, and finally smashed the stalking takins behind them, farther and farther. And the look of Richard’s pace has never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the wind blows from the depths of the mainland, gentle, dry, and gradually dense and strong. The outline of the scene in the corner of the eye is slowly elongated and becomes a deep and shallow line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed ​​is passionate. Richard's body gradually adapted to the environment, and finally adjusted to the best state, the perception extended in all directions, and if the next moment will be integrated into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world tree in the blood is more and more quiet, and every leaf has stopped even the slightest vibration, as if it has become a part of the vast world. The magma that is resting seems to wake up from sleep. The golden Desmason character seems to be scattered on the lake, so the almost static crimson slowly starts, gradually fluctuating, and finally Embarked on the rhythm of Richard's rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crimson popping of the ruined awakening is at the foot of the world tree, calming like the fountain of the Woolde, the favorite of the gods, in which it is exposed to destruction Before the tooth decay, it was so full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vast wilderness, I saw a lonely figure moving fast, crossing the vast wilderness. Wherever he passed, he was shocked by countless cows and horses. Several bloodthirsty dragons rounded their eyes and sent them to Lichao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the end, they did not plan to challenge the prey that they had never seen before. As long as they are born with this idea, they will instinctively feel fear and uneasiness. This intuition is the gift of this land to the creatures that live on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of Richard, dozens of riders are running at full speed. These are barbarian warriors. Most of them are horses with endurance and speed. However, a young barbarian who is headed by is a bloodthirsty dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of barbarian knights rarely consider the terrain, with superb riding and excellent mounts, basically in line. Every few tens of kilometers will stay a little, an elderly hunter will jump off the wildebeest, carefully identify the traces on the ground, then sniff in the wind, then point to a certain direction, dozens of knights That is to start again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are from a large tribe not far from the village port where Richard departed, and the most experienced in the village, and the hunter who saw Richard . Richard only walked for more than an hour at the time of departure. But this chase is from the morning to the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian knights were exhausted and had to stop and camp to rest. And a hundred kilometers away, Richard is lying under a giant tree common in the wilderness, looking at the stars through a few sparse branches at the top of the giant tree. During the day, the sky of Calando is extraordinarily high, but the night is different. The sky is more embarrassing than the Norland, as if the land is closer to the sky, it seems to be able to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the giant tree, there are several common bloodthirsty dragons that gather together and fall asleep. Richard and the tyrannosaurus were separated by more than ten meters, but they were safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard lay down casually, his hands resting behind his head, letting the starry light that is a little bright and dazzling, the mind is reminiscent of A little bit of past events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t tell his own mood, and he can’t tell the truth in his mind, Su Hailun, mountains and sea, sand, and so on. The feelings for the three of them seem completely different, but there are similar places. Richard himself can't tell the truth. What are the feelings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it love? He didn't know, and he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Richard knows that their position in their own minds is in roughly the same position as Ilanni and Gotton. In the mind of Richard, the place was reserved for the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
