One can gain more grace in the sacrifice, because the connection with the eternal and time dragons will expand, and the loss of natural sacrifice will be reduced. The other is to transform the future of the Book of Time into a formal altar, replacing the preconditions of the Time Lighthouse. After two rounds of ‘Eternal Passage I’ and ‘Crossing Core’, the Book of Time can serve as a temporary lighthouse. If you continue to strengthen the book of Time, you will receive the special gift of Eternal and Time Dragon, the coordinates of a main plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She certainly chooses Noland! Although it is only a temporary space channel with huge cost and limited effect, it is the only way to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at dozens of gods on the list, the sand can't help but bite. It is not that the rest of the options are useless, but that only the 'incentive' and the 'eternal channel I' are most effective in the situation where they are currently equated with being lost in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other contexts, other God-given options are equally attractive and even more so. For example, God's grace - extraordinary wisdom, it will permanently improve the intelligence of the object. As for the extent of the increase, it will increase the intelligence of an ordinary person by about half, which is the level of an ordinary genius. Ordinary geniuses will become rare geniuses if they get it. Placed on the drifting sand, the effect is similar to Richard's wisdom talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, God gives - reincarnation. The explanation is simple: a set of artifacts that have many effects that motivate the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s important to emphasize that this is a ‘set’ artifact, not a piece, a suit made up of artifacts! Even if the current sands are worn on the 'reincarnation', the magic and power will reach the level of the 18th-level gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a limited amount of gods that can be exchanged for this time. It can only be exchanged for one of the least powerful parts of the 'reincarnation': the spring flow necklace. Even the complete spring necklace can't be exchanged, only the missing version of it: the dripping necklace. However, this broken drip necklace can slightly increase the magical effect associated with time, and can slightly delay the aging of the wearer's body. At the same time, it can be used to provide a continuous healing effect with a four-level magical technique, which can be applied three times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the list, the sand can see all the components of the 'reincarnation', as well as some of its special effects. So she bit her teeth again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another attractive thing is the God-given guardian. This god gift can directly condense a power warrior by the power of time, as the guard of the recipient. The guardian of heaven is not awkward, its wisdom is even equal to the genius of human beings, but the loyalty to the recipient is unshakable. Its initial combat power is only twelve, and it can rise to the top of the 16th level with the battle or by the donor. In the future, the winners can also choose the guardian of the heavens by offering sacrifices, that is, they can get a new guardian of the heavenly election, and they can also raise the upper limit of the original guardian of the heavenly guard. That is to say, after choosing this grace three times, you can get a 20-level loyal guard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is enough grace, then the sacrificer can even get a squad of 20 tier guards! Even ordinary legendary powerhouses will not be willing to provoke such a team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are enough graces...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand of the sand is bitten tighter, So that the sound of the molars is made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" Richard noticed the strangeness of the sand drifting and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We...too poor!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha doubts: "Poor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand-sand chest is ups and downs, she simply closed Eyes, took a deep breath, then held his breath and chose 'Eternal Passage I'. When she opened her eyes and looked at Richard, she had already brought a lot of murderousness to her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is even more inexplicable, but with a wealth of past experience, it is not a question or a time to provoke her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sand is still holding the sentence: "If there is enough grace..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal Dragon Temple is used to the standard of life-giving, such as the extension of life as a measure of God's grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grace of the heavenly guardian is to extend life for fifteen years, and to gain 15 years of extra life in the Eternal Dragon Hall, you need to sacrifice a power with the big devil. A considerable sacrifice. Most of the big devils have more than 18 powers, and if you want to get a 20th-level guardian, you need to sacrifice at least three big devils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is not a sheep, he can't catch it if he wants to catch it. Even Gordon, the head of a big devil, is precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But! If you can offer five more devils, you can raise the rank of the defending guards by one level to reach twenty levels. This is a leap from the sanctuary to the legend! Only need nine big devils, you can exchange a legendary guard. This exchange is strictly speaking, the sacrificer still earned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of the legendary guards, the sand is not calm, and the breath began to bring the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Richard finally couldn't help but ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other pastors who are next to you, they are shocked by the powerful power displayed by the true God who is serving, and they don’t know enough about sand drifting. They only think that their young The expression of the faith instructor became more and more serious, and he did not notice the undercurrent under the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand!" The sand is raging, and the answer is to make Richard confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sand did not pay much attention to Richard’s feelings. In her heart, a beast that resembled the ancient wilderness was snarling: “Don’t Let me see it! You damn old dragon, knowing what I need, knowing that I don’t have so much grace, why should I see so many gods! Do I have to collect all my life Sacrifice, live for you? Damn! But... well, those things I really want, you win! This damn old dragon, I curse you!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate or curse, the dragon of eternal and time is there, the eternal life, the unmoved, and not angry. Even if the sands dedicate all the most vicious language under the sun to the dragon of eternal and time, she still has to struggle to collect more sacrifices and then dedicate them to the dragon of eternal and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are so many God-given options, but the usual means of eternal and timeless dragons, let you see, and how to have the motivation to collect sacrifices ? People always believe in themselves, and they always have **, and sand is no exception. Her ** is even stronger. The more capable a person is, the more he wants to get something that is hard to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
