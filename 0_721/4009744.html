			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked up at the starry sky above his head. Said: "But the 15-year-old Archimonde, a lot like me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred laughed, took a handful of Lee The armor was immediately taken down, and then he slapped a slap on his back and almost took his whole person into the soil. Then he said in a thunderous voice: "You think too much! At the age of fifteen Archimonde is really smart, but it is just smart. When the master is fifteen, he is still a little stupid. He is smarter than him. I don’t know how many. But now? Those smart guys are still not Know which corner to fight for!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked bright and said, "Do you mean Gordon Archimonde?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is your father!" Modred corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Gordon. Akmon?" Richard repeated it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, it’s him." Modred shrugged and said helplessly: "You are all Archimonde. Strange guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what do you mean?" Richard also stepped back and continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My meaning is very simple, you are now very good in the 15-year-old Archimonde, but when you are sixteen Certainly. Whoever laughs at the end is the best laughter. So first of all, the little guy, you have to live to sixteen! This is the meaning of the master let me take you on the road! The floating world has some It’s just bustling, gold coins and women!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under what Richard said, Modred said again: “Okay, little guy, you have to hurry now. Time to eat and sleep. Since you have that 'vigor' structure, our next plan has to be changed, tomorrow's journey is seven hundred kilometers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s cloudy, it’s raining, the sky is fine, and the years are quietly passing through in such a cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's time has passed, and Richard and Modred are not far from fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is always complicated, and people who are wise will encounter many accidents. What Gordon and Modred did not think was that the families that had enmity with Archimonde on this road converge very much, and there is no one who dares to take the initiative to provoke Modred. Not only did it not provoke provokes, it was that Modred was armed with the knights, swaying from their territory, and even passing directly through the castles of these nobles, which has been in the aristocratic tradition. It can be equated with the initiative to find the door, but the nobles are all tolerant, and they laugh with each other so that Modred can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred is a bloodthirsty killer, but it is not a rogue without a product, even if he runs wildly, he accidentally smashes a nobleman to commemorate The stone monument of the grand event, the other party is just a smile, but diligently asked the enchanted blacksmith to check the wear of the 'lava' hoof. What can he do? At this point, Modred also had no choice but to leave. Before leaving, he also took the initiative to leave a small bag of gold coins as compensation for the stone monument<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the way until arrival Under the city of Fu Shide, Richard did not really fight against people, but just killed a lot of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the iron hoof of the 'lava' set foot on the land of the eternal plateau, Richard did not expect a battle in the game. Archimonde’s reputation, or notoriety, seems to have spread the Holy Alliance. Without enough interest and a solid alliance, no one wants to face a madman alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eternal plateau, it also entered the legendary city of the floating world, and then no danger, direct danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal plateau has a flat terrain and an open view. The plateau is full of reddish-brown rocks, with fine grasses and numerous unnamed flowers. Embelled among them, strong colors impact the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Charler stopped the Iron Armor, slightly raised his head, and a strong wind immediately rushed to the face, letting him breathe. And let Richard not breathe, and there is a surprisingly far-sighted vision. Looking up, Richard feels that his sight seems far enough to bring the entire red eternal plateau to the bottom of his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total area of ​​the eternal plateau is not large, only a hundred kilometers in a circle, more like a huge platform on the mainland of Noland. But it is small, and it is not something that can be completely put into the human eye. Anyone who spies on its full picture will immediately feel suffocated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space is powerful. Even though Richard is used to seeing thousands of square meters of indoor space in the dark blue, he can't compare with the scenery in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing too much space, suddenly let Richard have a feeling of being lost. He held his breath and extended his line of sight a little bit, then saw a red-hot stone-like peak at the end of his line of sight. Too clear and broad horizons, but blurred the space and distance feeling of Richard. The series of data describing the red peak in the field of vision is completely incompatible with the scenes seen. The serious misplacement is simply going crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend has it that the first time people who set foot on the eternal plateau will get this land blessing filled with miracles and have the ability to see every corner of the eternal plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard finally knows that the legend is true. Just the taste of blessing is not as comfortable as imagined, but it is absolutely shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flaming red pillar-like peak is the miracle peak that carries the fauna. A thin line of almost invisible to the naked eye, coiled upwards, is the road to the summit. And the peak of the peak of the miracle... its top is actually hidden in the clouds. It is a cloud that floats around the peak of miracles. It is pure and clean, and it flows. However, if it has its own will and vitality, it has never been blown away by the strong hurricane on the eternal plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the white clouds that are like miracles, Richard sees that something is in the air, and it is hidden! He was taken aback, rubbed his eyes hard, looked at the past with his eyes, and finally saw that it was an island floating in the air! There are mountains, waters and vegetation on the island, as well as faint pieces of architecture in different styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... that is..." Richard pointed at the floating islands that were in the clouds, and was shocked to say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the floating island, the family listed in the floating world, all live on that thing. When I saw them for the first time, I almost I didn't believe my eyes. But at that time, we followed your father to volley. I almost didn't sleep for most of the month. I couldn't remember how many times I killed and how many people I killed. When I climbed the eternal plateau, I was already tired. Dead, just thinking about finding a place to hurry and sleep, how can you appreciate this miracle? Anyway, since it has arrived here, it will be able to go up sooner or later." The epic march in Mordred The mouth has become a faint sentence, but the kind of arrogance and domineering that comes to life is naturally revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
