			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Sauron on the Iron Throne suppresses his anger, slowly Say: "If I am replaced by Ellie, I will declare that the child born is the legal heir of the Marquis, and then set off the war and drive us out of the territory. Because it is forty in one. Second-order knights! We will lose most of this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the baron of Suya, Sauron said: "You tell the family next. The old guys in the parliament, this matter is handled in this way... In addition, let your army mobilize and guard against Ali. I will also support you with a thousand soldiers. Well, let me do what I said, and... ... I am very disappointed with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When leaving the hall, Suya felt that she was a little lost and her feet were so light, it seemed that every step of the step was not on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the floating island giants, Mensa and Schumpeter are naturally overcast, and they know that this is the beginning of Richard’s counterattack. The other skills of Richard have not yet appeared, but it is true that there is money than Gotton, and it is not a problem that has several times the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph has always kept silent, they are badly hurt, and the closest allies are the same. The situation is now very clear. When Richard publicly appeared in Faust, it means that the expeditionary army has been wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other people in the floating islands who are meeting in the evening to study how to deal with Richard’s accident. Many of them who are not in conflict with Richard and Archimonde have the support of Richard, hoping to reap the friendship of a royal architect, but how to do it and how to do it is a problem. After all, Richard’s foundation is weak, and it’s hard to hurt him without a strong enough strongman. After Richard left Faust, if the hostile family sent the strongman directly to assassinate, it was a hard-to-resolve killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nobles had their own guesses, Richard left the volcano and went to the Faro plane again, and this time he brought all Followers and strong. But his layout in Noland is not finished yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after Richard’s departure, another announcement spread throughout the Holy Alliance, but this time the impact was different from the last time. Almost all the strong inside the league noticed the announcement and became restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This announcement spread from the alliance to the entire human kingdom at an incredible speed, so that more and more strong people can sleep hard. Even after the strong got the news, they rushed back from the battlefield to confirm the truth of the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee announced that a private small auction will be held ten days after the end of the recruitment of the candidate knights. There is only one content of the auction, that is, Richard will tailor a second-order suit for the buyer himself or a designated person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tailor-made, second-order suits, when these two words are combined, there is endless magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some powerful people who are close to the legend, and they are all heart-warming. Although the legendary strongman himself does not need a second-order suit, he also has the need to cultivate future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire are concerned, they are more reluctant to stay in the Holy Alliance, and the Holy Alliance’s ideas are just right. in contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All doubts about the level of the construction of the inspections have long since disappeared at the press conference. Because the unnamed killer who successfully captured the suit, it was followed by a blockbuster, killing several powerful Sanctuary targets in succession. Since then, the reputation has been loud, and by the way, the reputation of Richard has spread farther and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the secret guide represents Richard’s creativity and talent in the construction, then life is the best illustration of the absolute level of the composition. Being able to make a life extinct, Richard will definitely make a fourth-order construction in the future. But the opposite is not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, anyone who wants to kill Richard under the Black Rose Castle must carefully consider the gains and losses and influences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in these few days, Faschi is also suffering, because Richard said to her meaningfully before leaving: "French Shi Qi, my patience is limited. Some opportunities, once missed, may not come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the infinite contradiction, she finally lifted the pen , wrote a text message to Ellie, as short as a few lines, and then passed through the magic communication to the distant Earl of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Ellie received the letter. During this time, she obviously stunned a lot, even the short hair of the fire has lost its luster, and the whole person is listless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat at her desk and licked the high stack of documents on the table, but she was completely unintentional. In her eyes, there is only a letter from Faschi. However, her hands, who had commanded thousands of horses, shivered at the moment, and wanted to touch the stationery several times, but they received it back like an electric shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an abnormal flush on her face, and then it turned pale again, but in any case, she did not dare to touch the sheet of paper that was fluttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice suddenly broke out: "Isn't that a letter?! Ah!!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached for the letter, but the man flew up, swept through the desk and fell to the other side of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice didn’t look back, dragged a wooden box directly from the corner and pulled it open, and it turned out to be twelve bottles of vintage brandy! She grabbed a bottle and directly flew the bottleneck, then looked up, the wine was like a spring, and it was poured directly into the throat. A bottle of wine was poured down in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not stop, and the second bottle was processed in the same way, followed by the third bottle, the fourth bottle, and even the fifth bottle. Even if it is a strong sanctuary, it is worth boasting to drink five bottles of spirits without using vindictiveness. Moreover, Ellie is still only seventeen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to catch the sixth bottle, but she grabbed it several times in a row, but it was empty. The bottle of wine, like the wings, flew around, just not letting her catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice suddenly felt that she wanted to laugh, but somehow many things in the past were sprayed out like a spring, and her face became hot and humid. She reached out and found that there was a lot of water on her face, but she looked up and looked at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not raining, but there is water on her face, hot, salty water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a soft knock on the door suddenly sounded, and the voice of the adjutant was worried outside the door: "The Earl, are you okay?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! I didn't drink too much!" A totally unexpected answer came out of Ellie's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the study was quietly pushed away. The young and handsome adjutant came in and worriedly looked at Ali, who was sitting on the floor, whispering: "The Earl, do you need to get some water for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to him is a cold dagger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice didn’t know where to pull out the short sword, and immediately put on the adjutant’s neck, the sword trembled gently, and he cut his white and delicate skin! At this time, Ellie’s eyes are as clear as water, how can she be drunk? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant only scared the whole body softly, his face pale as paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guards!" Ellie screamed. Her voice has been smothered, and the whole does not extinguish the fire everywhere in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant's face is whiter, his body is constantly shaking, and he trembles: "The Earl, you...how are you suddenly..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice snorted heavily, murderous in her eyes, said coldly: "Don't think you have a Marquis father, and a duke's uncle, you have a chance to get a finger I. You are still honest, I don’t know what I think. But your courage today is getting bigger, and I just don’t feel good! Go back and tell you that there are a lot of power and money. Relatives, I am fed up!! Who is not satisfied, we will see you on the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridors are filled with dense footsteps, a bunch of fully armed guards appear at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice said one finger outward: "Take it down and smash it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger-like guards immediately took the adjutant off the ground. Compared with these veteran soldiers who have been under the battle of Alice, the adjutant is as soft as a little white pigeon. He was taken away, not towed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the adjutant screamed out loudly: "Alice, you can't do this to me! You wait! No one will supply you with horses, nor People will supply you with weapons and armor, and even you will go out to grab the food of the soldiers! Ah!! You guys, what are you doing, take your hands off... Don’t..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant’s chicken-like voice went all the way and eventually disappeared into the depths of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice said waved to the guard at the door and said, "Go tell General Teton and let him come to my office tomorrow morning to get something! Just say, The thing he wants most is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the door of Alize’s study was heavily dropped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the door, Ellie suddenly felt that her whole body had lost her strength, leaning back against the door, slowly sliding on the ground, grasping her with both hands. In the short hair, I cried again, and the more I stopped, the more I couldn’t restrain myself. Finally I fell on the ground and cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few veterans who have not left outside the study, look at me, I look at you, nod each other and quietly leave. In the hallway, they also echoed their quiet conversation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, Lao Tzu decided that the military for the next three months would not be!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
