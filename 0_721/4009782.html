			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fauna, there are two ways to get the floating island to the top. One is to grab directly, the other is to be like the present, with the supreme luck, to obtain a huge and unparalleled grace. In the latter way, the benefits of the expansion of the floating island area are second. The important thing is that the family has won the eternal and timeless dragon in a short period of time, in a short year and two or three years. In the time, within the scope of FS, a large-scale direct attack on this family may have serious consequences of lowering its own gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the history of fait, few families do this, the randomness of grace is on the one hand, and on the other hand, because there is no power to do the ranking, It’s just a false prosperity. Even if it’s barely achieved, it won’t last long. Unless it is a family ready to move to the level, it is worthwhile to take a chance. For example, the floating island on the seventh floor is not attached to any magic. When you transition to the sixth track, there will be one more. The magic is used to strengthen the floating island defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon is not the first sacrifice, the natural floating island is changing, in addition to luck, how much grace is consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich, I am afraid that the half of the acquired grace is distributed to the Archimonde family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon didn’t come and say anything, his face suddenly changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vatican’s great priest on the side also showed an extremely shocked look, and the hand holding the scepter began to tremble uncontrollably! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Gordon’s voice was full of sorrow, and he immediately looked at the Vatican’s great priest, but he saw that he was always calm, elegant and beautiful. At this time, the priest was actually an unstoppable shock, ecstasy, and a letter that almost boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred’s induction was delayed for a moment, and his face changed dramatically, looking up at the endless void of the temple. There, an indescribable will is coming slowly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, everything is calm and safe. Whether it is the other knights of Gordon, or the priests who stand on the periphery, they are unaware of what is happening. It seems that I have discovered the strangeness of my own leaders and have turned my attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s great divine officer tried to maintain the surface of the Ning, but the voice was constantly shaking, she almost whispered: “This is eternal and time. The dragon's body will is a true miracle! Impossible, just the heart of a small demon lord, how can the great eternal and the dragon of time come to the will?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly stared at Gordon, her eyes bright as stars: "Marquis! What sacrifices have you prepared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon Hearing is the eternal and timeless dragon's body will, although surprised, the taut nerves have relaxed, then smiled and spread his hand: "There are two things. Here is the eternal dragon temple, what secrets can be won Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glamorous light in the eyes of Vatican’s priests is gradually darkening, not to say anything, but to look at the curtain of time, with incomparable fanaticism Faith and piety. It is a pity that she is not able to wear the light curtain formed by the dragon power of eternal and time. Even with her transcendental identity, she cannot disturb the rituals that do not belong to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s official head suddenly turned to Gotton’s side and said in a deliberately low voice: “The Marquis, I remember you just said, Li I will soon go to the ectopic plane to explore, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I have prepared a suitable sub-plane coordinate for him, and a foothold has been established on it." Gordon replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a student, drifting sand, already a level 8 oracle. I hope that Richard's core team can give her a place." Lynn’s tone is very dull, as if it were just a trivial little thing, not a formal solemn request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s look is more serious, asking: “Is it the sand that won the title of 'breaking dawn'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin nodded and said, "It’s her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title is not self-styled, but is obtained by eternal and The dragon of time gave it. There are only two priests who have the title in the eternal dragon temple of the floating world. They are the sacred vines of the 'Dawn' and the sheds of the ‘breaking’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon indulged a bit and nodded and said, "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican Lin Da Shenguan smiled, and the sacred and solemn beauty suddenly made everyone shine. She reached out and placed it on Gordon's chest and said, "The Marquis, practicing the promise, you will receive my highest friendship for a period of ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon He also grinned and was able to get the friendship of Vatican. The role of Archimonde in Faust was obvious. Although it is only her personal friendship, it is equally precious. As for the time limit, the priests of each eternal and time dragon will try to add time limits to anything, which is a way for them to express their faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "Is the followers of Richard not selected yet? Is there a candidate for the soul defender?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three or four suitable candidates in Archimonde's death camp recently, so let him pick it up. But the number of followers of the core team is not enough." Gotton said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s great sergeant smiled and said with deep meaning: “I heard that in a week, the slave market in Mokfand Port will be a good one. The goods, the lord of the house, Mofan still owes me a little friendship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Gotton nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the light curtain, Richard could not describe the shock in his heart, and he could not get back control of the body. And his self-righteous will and soul, but with every wave of time faltering, can be completely disintegrated at all times. This is not an intentional attack. It is only the time fluctuation of the eternal and timeless dragon's will, but the existence is too strong, even if this indescribable will has deliberately slowed down the process of coming, still causing The tsunami-like arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal..." The voice of the Eternal and Time Dragon once again sounded in the soul of Richard, this powerful existence only probed a glimpse into the altar The range, the intensity of the soul reverberation is reduced by more than half. And its first call almost directly destroyed Richard's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Great Eternal and the Dragon of Time, what do you command?" Richard gritted his teeth and barely responded to the swaying consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where mortal, I saw a sacrifice in your body that would satisfy me, put it on the altar, and you will receive the title and care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifices? A glimpse of Richard, all the sacrifices have been sacrificed! Suddenly he moved and looked at the chain of beasts wrapped around his wrist. Those unconscious eyebrows are now with a touch of golden light, which is the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This string of mountains and the sea gives him a chain of beasts, which is the sacrifice that will lead the will of the eternity and the dragon of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard remembered the mountains and the sea. It was a heavy burden like a mountain, with a strong background and unspeakable wealth, but never Young girls who have never put them in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great eternal and time dragon, please forgive me for being rude, but this string of beasts is a gift from friends and cannot be sacrificed to you. Richard said hard but firmly in his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mortal, everything that you cherish now, will be turned into nothingness in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But it is what I cherish now, and now is enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the Eternal and Time Dragon seems to fluctuate a bit, then In the consciousness of Richard, it echoed: "A mortal, if you change your mind in the future, you can offer sacrifices to me in any eternal dragon temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the unspeakable will slowly faded, and Richard gasped and gasped, and fell to the ground, weak and even had no effort to move a finger. When the great will slowly rises, even his soul seems to be driven to almost withdraw from the body. But he seems to see that before the eternity of the Eternal and Time Dragon's body will leave, it seems that there are several light spots that fall into the sky and blend into the time ball that still floats on the altar. Then there was a very strong life fluctuation in the time ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei gasps for a while, barely stand up and walk towards the time ball. This is the biggest reward, I don't know what will be inside. But no matter what was there, after rejecting the requirements of the Eternal and Time Dragon, Richard had no expectations at all. Richard reached out and touched the time ball, so after a strong ray of light, he had a dark blue egg in his hand. Even through the eggshell, Richard can feel the intense life fluctuations in the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got this strange egg, Richard only got a short message, short to only one word: "Seed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seed? What is a seed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li was confused, the light of the altar was dimmed, and it became a stone platform eroded by wind and sand, and the curtain of time slowly dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was holding the 'seed' in front of the altar, Vatican’s great singer exclaimed: “How could it be a seed!?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seed? What is that?" Gotton flashed a glimmer of light in his eyes. Although he didn't know what the seed was, he saw the Vatican. The eclipse knows that it is by no means an ordinary thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s sergeant’s complex expression, slowly said: “The seed is the official name. In private, it is generally called the species of destiny and destruction. This is An indescribable god, its specific role is one of the top secrets of the Eternal Dragon Hall, can not be rumored. Richard got the seeds, this is good news, but also bad news. The good news is that in the unknown plane Our Richard will give his enemies a big surprise. The bad news is that his plane journey must be advanced, because we must not let the seeds hatch in Noland. He must enter the other within one month. Plane, this requirement... you can be regarded as the god of eternity and the dragon of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
