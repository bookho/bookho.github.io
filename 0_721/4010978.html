			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since entering the legend, no, since going to the endless battlefield dusk, Richard has little fear and never had such deep fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the end of the rì mark, he knows the horror of the reaper, but how terrible it is, but Richard can not be measured and described by a standard. Unknown is not the greatest fear, knowing that part of it will really fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Richard is afraid at this moment is precisely because of the huge power gap between him and the reaper. That is almost a divide! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang, the end rì imprint was completely shattered in the hands of Richard, the mechanical seal inside broke out, the muzzle instantly shè two beams, shè Richard's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light beam penetrated Richard's robe and burned two scorch marks on his chest. At this moment, Richard closed his left hand and grasped the machine and pinched it into a scrap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his left hand, and the palm of his hand was an irregular metal ball. Just the shaped machine had been completely pinched by him into a complete piece. The metal, all the parts are naturally no longer restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately untied his clothes and examined the scars on his chest. The two scars are not deep, and the injury can be said to be insignificant. But how big is this machine? It is just a small finger size, the beam of the shè can actually hurt Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of his body's defenses, and even if he is not determined to use the power of the rules, it is quite difficult to hurt him. This shows the attack power of this miniature reaper. A bombardment of small things, the power has been comparable to the full force of the heavenly sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the group of damaged metal, Huo Di stood up and ordered all followers in consciousness, let them immediately to the black rose Ancient castle assembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Richard has appeared in the battle room of the Black Rose Castle. Most of the followers have arrived, and only Seldon and Senma have not come because they need to be stationed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large magic map of Faro is hung in the war room. And Richard is standing in front of the magic map, silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he turned and looked at a group of followers and said in a low voice: "Faro is my first plane, now It will also be the first lost plane. Because it may be the most terrible enemy we have ever encountered, the reaper has arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the combat room is actually a silence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one speaks, they don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who has participated in the plane war has heard of the reaper legend. They are like a group of unstoppable monsters, one of which is their food. Until now, I have not heard of any survivor of the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of the people who joined later, even the 13th Cavaliers of Assisi, it’s hard to understand Richard’s kind of Faro Special feelings. Only Tiramisu and Shuihua, the followers who first followed Licha to Faro, and who had been through the hardships of nine deaths, could truly appreciate the mood of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time to accompany Richard, there are ten stepping knights, and at this moment they have already returned to their hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Achilles first said: "His Royal Highness, we must first prepare for the battle, at least to stop the reaper for a while, so that we can retreat." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is silent, and other followers do not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland does not lack the example of the reaper. Past experience points out that the reaper will gradually drag this plane away from eternity after occupying the entire plane. The range of divine power with the Dragon of Time. At the same time, no matter how many channels there are, they rarely continue to attack the next plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Achilles’s words are very clear, the core is to retreat, to withdraw the goods and personnel in Faro as much as possible, and to fight the reapers just to fight for Time, then withdraw as much material as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the reaper appeared, then Faro, together with the aborigines inside, was all over. Achilles is an old man who follows Gordon. The relationship between him and Richard is not so deep as it is a continuation of Gordon’s loyalty. Faro has no special meaning to him, so he is suitable for speaking. Can also make objective suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard finally nodded and said, "I know. Then, now is the next arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to expand the plane transmission channel, naturally through The sacrifice continued to strengthen the plane of the plane from Faro to Noland. Then Richard will mobilize the entire army of Archimonde and vigorously expand the army. Fortunately, during this period of time, Richard has gone all out to increase the production capacity of armaments and desperately expand the army. It is not too passive now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the internal movement of Faro. This is a two-step process. One is to let the mother's nest release a large number of reconnaissance beasts, marching to the edge of the mainland, and scouting the harvest. The movement of the person. In addition, it is a gathering of troops, close to the time lighthouse of the Blue Water Oasis. The indigenous warriors who have been following Richard for a long time, Richard does not intend to give up them, ready to withdraw them all to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout was concise and simple, and it took only half an hour for Richard to arrange everything. These measures were brewed in his heart for a long time. I don’t know how many times. At this moment, when the reapers really arrived, Richard was not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After allocating the task, Richard’s eyes looked at a group of special people in the corner of the war room, which was a group of strong people led by the Iron Shield, including four Legend and ten heavenly sanctuaries. They are different from followers and more like the mercenaries of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and said to the iron shield: "You know the situation now. In the next period of time, Archimonde’s focus will be It will be fighting the Reaper. The reaper is far more dangerous than you think, and the legendary might also be in danger of life. This is different from when you first decided to play for Archimonde. So now you There is another chance to choose. If you are willing to continue to work for Archimonde, stay here, I will treat you as a follower. If you don't want to, it doesn't matter, you can leave now. The points battlefield will still be open to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield is the leader of these strong people at the moment, but this group of people are from all directions, many people have not known each other before. Moreover, the strength reaches the level of the heavenly sanctuary, and most of them have the strength of monopolizing one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the iron shield said: "His Royal Highness, if I am willing to stay, can the treatment be improved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately said: "Double! In addition, there will be points for the fight against the Reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Shield immediately nodded and said, "Well, I am leaving!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the iron shield and said, "Leave very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield laughs: "The power has reached our level. Who is not nearly dead? I want to continue to improve, so I am not afraid of danger. If I can If I survived the war, then I can upgrade most of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and looked at the other strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the strong are the determined people, they are very aware of the danger of the war with the Reaper, and the harvest is also great. And there is no need to say a few words. After the war, as long as Richard is not dead, they will enter the ranks of Richard from the outside strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard has already skyrocketed, regardless of the composition, power or personal force, it ranks among the top in the mainland. Now even some people have begun to think that it is expected to reproduce the martial arts of Charles the Great in the past! Even opening up a big empire is not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Noland has three great human empire, there is still land in the plane. If the human domain is not enough, it can also expand outward. For example, the Polar Continent, the Cangqing Continent and the Calando Continent are all good places to establish a country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, only one of the strong and the five heavenly sanctuaries decided to leave. Everyone else intends to follow Richard and participate in this war with the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a gesture, and Achilles took the box of magic scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Now is a special period, I don't want to betray, and I don't want to weaken our strength because of beliefs. So these are The magic slavery contract, unlimited time. When the war is over, I will give you another chance to choose, and I will continue to be my followers. If I want to leave, I will cancel the contract with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Shield does not hesitate to pick up a magic contract, open it, and write the name directly on it with your own blood. When he signed, the magic slavery contract immediately burned and turned into two dark gold sè runes, which flew into the iron shield and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
