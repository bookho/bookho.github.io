Obviously, your progress in the plane war is quite smooth. Equipment transactions, especially enchanting equipment transactions, have always been lucrative, and you are A considerable part of the equipment is purchased from me, so in this regard, my first proposal is to sell half of all the equipment production workshops in my hands, so that my weapons and equipment industry will be all in the future. The income will be divided equally between you and me, and your money will be used as an investment to build a production equipment base in your territory or in my territory, doubling the existing production capacity."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked flashing and smiled: "You are so generous and ambitious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an ambitious plan, and Nolan has given up a considerable piece of interest, but now In the past year, the purchase of external equipment has reached an astonishing more than 2 million gold coins, of which less than one-third is purchased from Nolan. If Richard can get half of the profits, then of course he Will turn a large number of orders to this side, so Nolan has been damaged, but the loss in this piece is not very big, but what Richard is more fancy is the strategic significance of this, no one will be willing to own warrior Armor weapons and horses are in the hands of other people, so any lord, even a small baron, will place several weapons workshops on the territory, even if the scale is small enough to only make some ordinary weapons and armor. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think about setting up his own equipment production system. He has been working hard in this area, but Richard may not lack gold coins, sacrifices and Resources, but only craftsmen can't get it. A skilled craftsman needs at least ten years to train. The masters and craftsmen needed for a fine enchantment equipment are not ordinary proficiency. This kind of money can't be bought. What can be accumulated by time is called the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s cooperation, Nolan and others shared their core resources, and it’s important to say that it’s important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not speak, continued to wait for the following, Nolan looked at Richard’s expression and said: “The sand is gone, she also took away two The guardian of the heavens, the level of the priests of our eternal dragon temple is not comparable to that of the general gods. This must be very clear to you, so the second cooperation is that I can let the four young priests who follow me fight you. They are all fourteenth-level wizards. They have a great role on the battlefield. In addition, I can play when necessary. Of course, this will have a considerable loss to my god, so I am Need to be compensated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things can be said to have cut the key points, which is the most urgent aspect of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who were sent by Nolan were gone. In the battle of thousands of troops, the role of four intermediate-level priests was quite limited, but Nolan was willing In person, the meaning is absolutely different. As the dragon priest who is second only to Vatican, although Richard did not see the level of Nolan, he would not be worse than the Pope’s Pope. Go, as for Vatican himself, maybe he can fight the god of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then your request." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three things in total. First, I hope that your sacrifice in the floating dragon palace will be hosted by me in the future. Second, I There are some special channels in the hand, you can get some rare plane coordinates, these planes are very dangerous, the environment is particularly bad, but the corresponding will also have huge gains, I do not have enough ability to develop them, only one in the past I sold it, but now, I hope that we can use your strength to develop, and we will still be half of the final income. In the end, I will have some construction needs, I hope you can give priority to it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Richard has felt enough, so he said: "Your sincerity is very good, but I want a condition, I still need a condition, and this condition is The most critical..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan suddenly had a reddish face and angered: "You guy, do you want to... want..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and said: "Of course not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a while before he sighed and said, "I want to know why the sand drift suddenly develops dark areas."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Nolan’s silence. After a while she said, “You should know that there are things we can’t say.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "But you always have a way to let me know, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan stared at Richard for a look Yes, Richard did not give in, and then said helplessly: "I do have some small tricks, can deceive the autonomy of the eternal and time dragons to stay in the Dragon Temple, but I really feel that you still don't know. Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't always escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan nodded and said, "If you must know, I will try to tell you a part, but I remember you." I still owe me a third-order construction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and his voice became extremely tempting and said: "If you can tell I am all, then the structure will become fourth-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan lost the voice: "Four-order construction, you have been able to make four The structure is installed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you are willing to invest time and materials." Richard said faintly, there is strong confidence in the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan took a deep breath, his chest quickly slammed to an astonishing height, and then his face glowed with excitement, saying: "That said Ok, whatever kind of structure will do, as long as it is fourth-order, but I still feel that you don't know well now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me, all," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard finally knew everything he wanted to know, and finally understood why he finally went from being poisoned to suddenly getting a fair fight. The environment, there is no balance between Philip and the Eternal Dragon Temple. He has already died on the snowy mountains. At that time, the mountains and the sea actually had a decision. If Richard died, she would end her life. Never accept the fate arranged by the Holy Temple. As a person whose fate is already within the sight of the beast, the sudden death of the mountain and the sea will surely cause the attention of the beast god, thus lowering the punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he finally recovered the mountains and the sea, but it almost lost the sand forever. I don’t know when it will take me to enter the dark area. Go and pick up the gods who used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no expression on Li’s face, just sitting quietly, and Nolan suddenly felt so quiet that she was scared and could not help but persuaded: Richard, don't blame yourself. In fact, it is the power of destiny that drives this thing behind the scenes. The oracles of eternal and timeless dragons will eventually embark on the road of pioneering dark areas. The fate of the whole world cannot be changed at all. What we see is an event that seems to be accidentally worn together, but in the end all things happen will point to the same end. This is fate, even if you change it. Part of it can't change the final result, just like a river, you can cast a huge stone inside, but the water will bypass it and continue to run forward, this is fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard finally turned his head and looked at Nolan. He smiled a bit and said, "You mean, even if I don't go to Calando, the sand will definitely open up the dark areas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the fate of all the gods." Nolan said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the Vatican's great priest is not coming back." Richard's heart ignited a faint hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vatican's great priest, she is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that Nolan is not Suddenly speaking, but suddenly lost the voice, her face immediately passed the panic, his face suddenly became pale, the whole person's breath suddenly weakened a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up and shouted: "Nolan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan pendulum I waved my hand and gestured to myself. Then I smiled weakly and said, "Have you seen it? This is the power of God. It is omnipresent. I just want to say things that cannot be exported, so I am punished." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, but did not ask Nolan why he didn’t have to tell him the way he just said, but since Nolan didn’t say it, then it’s not enough, I want it. Deceiving the Eternal and the Dragon of Time can never be such a simple matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I understand, I hope we can always have a good cooperation in the future." Richard extended his hand to Nolan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan did not hold his hand, but gave Richard a light hug and said: "We should be the most determined ally and best. The partner, time will prove."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan's hug is aristocratic, although Richard is slightly abrupt, but regards this as her kind Attitude, the two people discussed the details of the cooperation, and Richard walked out of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea are sitting on a stone in the shade of the tree. When they see Richard, they greet them and say, "Things are solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said with some exhaustion: "I want to know, now I know, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
