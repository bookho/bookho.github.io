			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This temper is quite stinky! It’s dare to be stubborn at this time!" Fokker stepped on Richard’s head and smiled The group of aristocratic youths said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time he did not get an eager response, all the aristocratic youths were pale and looked at Fokker at a loss. They have more eyesight than bystanders, not only recognize the aristocratic color of Richard, but also see the value of the single texture and style, Richard has surpassed Wolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t understand one at all, the worst case is just the fight of the skin and the swelling of the skin, why it will develop to this extent. Looking at the blood of the big beach under the head of the unknown aristocrats at the foot of Fokker, and the place where the shoulders were hit by heavy blows, the completely cracked clothing, I know that this time the trouble is too big, it is no good. . The background of their point is not enough for Archimonde to anger. As long as I think of the bloody means before and after Goethe’s presence in Faust, these have never been on the battlefield, and I have never seen a lot of aristocratic youths who can’t help but float from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the woods, Senma suddenly burst into an amazing momentum, she stopped moving, staying at a 30-degree acute angle with the front of the viper, such as cheetah The body is low, and the body of ** is now beginning to contain explosive power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake is obviously nervous, and obviously Senma senses what she wants to start at any cost. In the face of this fierce and arrogant horror, he is not fully grasped by a smashing arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this arrow can't delay the ability of Senma to make her rush to the corner of the street conflict, then even the dying blood paladin can be in a few seconds In the clock, kill all the people of the Joseph family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the viper, he almost intended to blog, and when he pulled the trigger, Senma suddenly stopped, slowly stood up, and then looked at the dead. Looking at the poisonous snake, he said in a mocking tone: "You have done a really good job in this game, even I have to admire it! Unfortunately, the only thing you lack is luck. Before you implement a similar conspiracy, remember to go to the Eternal Dragon Hall. Pray! Now, what you should consider is how you ran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake almost felt at the same time not far from rising two strong breaths, The face changed immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Fokker’s face has a somewhat distorted smile, all the vindictiveness burns in the body, converges into explosive power, stepping on Richard The feet of the head are gone! This power can completely crush the head under your feet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real purpose of Fokker so far! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fokker believes that after a lot of camouflage in the front, the power of this moment can completely make all the hidden powerful people around there unable to react. When they rushed to the front, Richard had already suffered a fatal blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, there will definitely be strong protection around Richard. However, according to the nobility, the struggle between the younger children and the fight, the strong of the family will not intervene. The contradiction of the same class is solved in the same level. This is a very false principle of fairness, but it is also a tempering of the younger generation, respect for personal strength, and avoiding the huge family being dragged into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything has a bottom line, that is life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a younger generation of the Joseph family with inheritance, no one would have thought that he would be so crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only Fokke himself knows clearly that as the biological son of the Duke of Joseph, a talented warrior, he is destined to be a victim of the family, not This time, it will be the next time. The factor determining fate is because his mother is only a low-status civilian, and his own talent is not good enough to reverse the fate. Instead, because of the aura of talent, it is more destined to the fate of his victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the family powers, the value of the aristocratic children is still determined by the bloodline. Therefore, in essence, Wolin and Fokker's status is quite the same, and Richard and Fokker's status is also quite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed Richard, Fokker could not be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fokker’s worst result was being shot on the spot by the strongman of Archimonde’s family. The best result was to return to the family and die decently. In order to give the Archimonde a confession, it also gives a confession to the Holy League royal family and the giants of Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Joseph lost a son, and the Marquis of Gordon also lost a son. This is a very fair result, at least it seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from another perspective, the Joseph family lost only one fighter who might not be able to enter the sanctuary, but Archimonde lost a future big The builders, the loss is completely different. You are welcome, that is, one hundred Fokkers can't match one of Richard's fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joseph family chose to launch at this time, also for this consideration. Richard has not yet established himself. No matter how deep his potential and talent, his identity is still only the son of the Marquis of Gordon. If it is over time, Richard is officially appointed as a family architect, or has won the title of the title, even if it is only a landless knight, can not be exchanged for the price of a son of the duke, then it will be handed over. At least a family branch. This is political fairness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the limited loss thrown by the Joseph family is the whole of life for Fokker! So when he stepped on his strength, he made a mad laughter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, Fokker suddenly discovered that the world in front of him was suddenly dim and could hardly see anything. In the center of the field of vision, a dark giant sword appears to emerge from the void, instantly occupying all his vision! Invisible pressure first shrouded Fokker's body, making him almost breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is I dying?" Fokker’s thoughts passed through the lightning and desperately closed his eyes, but his right foot stepped on. . Even if it is dead, it will not be a loss to take a big master of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the giant sword is about to plunge into the chest of Fock, another unpredictable sword flies horizontally, and the giant sword is knocked open! Fokker had just breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly found himself stiff and couldn’t move anymore. The right foot didn’t even step on it. He shouted in his heart, burning all the vindictive temperament, wanting to break free, but this power is too strong, strong to no resistance! On the last point, he can step on Richard's head. Now the last distance is as far away as the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fokker desperately found that his body was rising, but he still tried to kick his right foot, trying to give Richard a critical strike. Just need it, he got enough price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
