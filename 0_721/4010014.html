			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time in the first hotel, the construction of the final collection of Richard suddenly Looking up at the window, just after he felt a strong incitement in his heart, the node from the ogre was familiar with the strongest warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was an accident!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magical Slavery Contract only allowed Richard to know each other roughly If the distance is too far, it can only transmit some very vague feelings. Therefore, Richard only senses the strong danger but can't know exactly what happened in the triad. Because there is warning and warfare passed there. Ask for help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately sealed up the newly-made structure and replaced the mage robes that had solidified the defensive magic array. The other side of the magic box will already be divided into mén. The magic scrolls put in the class are stuffed into the pockets of the mage robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also woke up the sand in the next room to let her prepare for the fastest speed while Richard contacted all the followers with soul connections in consciousness. The order to prepare for the battle was issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard was finally able to confirm the incident, and the more ambiguous messages from Oral and Twilight came on, but they were two forces. Too low a distance is too far away than the information transmitted by the three-point ripening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an orderly manner, Richard completed the preparations for the battle and completed all the preparations in less than a minute to open the room mén and walked downstairs to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hotel is full of bubbling and barbarians, the guards have rushed out of the room and the throwing soldiers in the basement are in a crowd Several giant bats rise from the attic skylight and hover in the night sky with the talented sound waves and the sharp vision of the nesting creatures searching for all suspicious signs in the oasis city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the military camp not far away, Tiramisu suddenly woke up from his sleep and almost burst into a headache, letting it hold his head and keep groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is coming from the thunderous roar of Gangde. The sleeping soldiers are bombarded from the camps and they are quickly picking up their arms and wearing armor in the square. The upper collection waits for the next command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of Saudis are heading to Ma Rong. The leader and elite of them are all loyal and combative with more than a dozen battles with Richard. A sly sandman will become an elite cavalry as soon as he has a saber and a horse. The cavalry can gather in two minutes and bring together the squadrons that they rushed to Richard’s residence. Seal the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few minutes, the soldiers under Richard’s squad are all mobilized. The most elite group has been assembled and ready to enter the battlefield, and Richard has not been mobilized. The cumbersome information drowned his wisdom and talent ability to run at high speed. Although the follow-up feeling conveyed by the contractors on the three nodes became worse, he still maintained the absolute calm of the mind. This is also one of the basic qualities of the Dark Blue Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A window that just passed through the corridor of the hotel, suddenly noticed that he was shocked and threw himself to the ground and immediately issued a long-range attack protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang of the whistle of the whistle of the week, the magic shield of the week, the remote attack protection, almost just appeared, was broken by a silver long arrow silently From the position where Richard was standing, it was easy to break through the obstacles of several walls and then disappeared into the night without knowing where to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
