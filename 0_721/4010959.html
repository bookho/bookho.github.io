			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the long, vigorous horn sounded again, and the knights The neat array is re-converted into a steel torrent, along the established route, embarking on a bloody journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the entire Noland was again shocked by Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Gordon created a glorious chapter with the thirteen knights. Now Richard has crushed all the floating islands in a more thorough way, pushing all the way. This can no longer be called glory. For a time, even the most learned historian did not find any adjectives to describe Richard’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the major lords is different. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Millennium Imperial Palace, the Prince of Tumen was chatting with the Tibetan sword and the Garan Emperor. When the news came, the original eyes of the Garan Emperor’s eyes were lowered. Opened, and the Tibetan sword silently glanced at each other and hanged down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tibetan sword said softly: "It seems that there is another great little guy. I heard that he brought the mountain and the sea?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Prince Tumen said that he thought about it and said: "Calculating time, her sleep period is coming to an end, maybe there will be a surprise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibetan smiled and said, "No, this little guy will not let her participate in the battle. It is a stubborn child, always I want to put everything on myself. From this point of view, it is very similar to Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen sighed: "Gordon It’s a pity, otherwise the future will be very high. Although I have only seen him once, it gives me the feeling that it is a natural king.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Garland Emperor suddenly said: "I heard that Richard began to know all the scholars of the Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen said, "There is such a return." What happened?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor said: "We are not in control of the whereabouts of several scholars. I heard that there is a very senior guy who can participate in their parliament. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galan said faintly: "These scholars are dug out, they can grasp it, and if they can’t catch it, they will kill it. Then they were handed over to Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen glimpsed in the heart, knowing that the Emperor finally made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Tibetan sword next to it asks inexplicably: "When we catch it, why should we hand it over to Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to reward the money. The little guy is very rich, we just have the treasury emptiness, can subsidize a little." The imperial gentleman's answer made the Prince of Tumen and the Tibetan sword all heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords of the Holy Tree Dynasty were distracted and shocked. After digesting the news, they kept their attention. And many of the big lords who had insisted on sanctions against Richard, after being scared in the back, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most affected, nature is still the sacred alliance of floating islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Mensa smashed all the things that could be smashed in the study that night, but after finishing the things, the followers did not wait for any orders. Without further orders, the army that has already reached the designated position will stop in the same place and will not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights in the old Joseph study are lit all night. When he walked out of the study room that day, the followers who had been waiting for the night outside were horrified and found that the Duke was a lot older, and now he has completely turned into an old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Duke of the Duke, we" just wanted to ask for instructions, the old Joseph waved his hand, interrupted his words, and then went back to the bedroom to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the 7-7 floating island, the Duke of Anan suddenly laughed and then shouted loudly: "The person who told us, without my order, would not allow Play! Let's die and let others go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the six-story floating island, such as Wellington, the Duke of Turan, etc. are sitting silently, lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5-5 Floating Island, from the time of getting the news, the Iron Man Dagong stood in front of the magic map, never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this large map of the Holy Alliance, a red line clearly outlines the route of this Akmon blood route. As early as two months ago, Richard announced the route to enter FS, and he was not afraid of ambush or interception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands of the big man behind his back are consciously tightened, and it is hard to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Family is one of the most important pillars of the Holy Alliance. In the Alliance, both strength and status are only under the royal family. Intercepting Richard's heavy responsibility, he will fall on the iron family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other floating island giants can wait and see, even the Wellington family can also excuse to say that they can wait to see the decision of the Iron Man, but the Iron Man can not do this. Whether the war is a retreat depends on one thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to fight, what to fight for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha 挟 骑 构 构 , , , 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟 挟<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of an army composed entirely of knights, there is no point in what to attack, ambush or sing. Even if all the floating islands are united, this battle will be defeated. Not to mention that under the superb command of Richard, these knights will inevitably produce incredible power. Unless <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the giants do their best and do their best, there is hope to encircle the army. But this is a bloody journey, not a national war between the Holy Alliance and the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no meaning to lose the bloody journey, but it will in vain let the power of the entire Holy Alliance be greatly damaged, and the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire will be cheaper. The Iron Man also clearly remembers the humiliation that the two great empirators asked when they re-demarcate the three-party border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the Iron Man also wants to deepen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to fight, the Jagged family must be at the forefront. There may be six or seven at that time, and perhaps three or five families will follow the iron and blood. However, no matter whether there are several families in the battle, one thing is certain. Even if only three or four families do not move, then this force in the hands of the Duke of Iron and Blood will be killed by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I am afraid that the order of the floating islands will have to be changed again. Of course, those floating island giants who do not move can change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the resources that can be used by the Jagged Emperor are not too many, he can not draw all the family for the blood route. On the strong side, White Night has clearly stated that he will not participate and return to the place of dusk. Agamemnon is not particularly active, and his words are even less, and he does not make any suggestions at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then concession? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other families can give in, but the iron family can not give in, because the reputation damage will be the most serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Man is standing like this, meditating, and unconsciously, the sky is already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day was the most confusing and toughest day, and countless people were watching the development of the situation, ready to adjust their response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction army of Richard only traveled more than 100 kilometers on this day and camped at the chosen location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Richard encountered countless scouts that were far from wandering. According to common sense, when so many scouts appear, it means that a big battle will come. But until Richard camped, there were only scouts around, and no military at all was seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resting point of the military camp was also announced along with the route. When the night falls, Richard only releases the normal number of sentries, and then let the army rest, not afraid of people attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the deep night, several light-loaded cavalry are riding in the battle, watching the brightly-lit barracks of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the number of sentries, a young scout couldn’t help but say: "They’re too lax in defense? If you bring thousands of people The night attack, maybe they will be sent back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is a bearded veteran. When he heard the young scouts, he immediately shouted: "Put / fart! The sleep in the military camp is all about the construction of the knight! Just because of your two sons, I want to attack at night. Most of them are still a kilometer away from them. When did you hear about the whole camp? Will the knight be attacked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young scout listened to his neck shrinking, and he said with some dissatisfaction: "If that is the case, are we not found here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beard He snorted and said with a sneer: "Do you think they don't know that we are here? People are just too lazy to kill us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not impossible? "The young scout is scared and his face is white." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small episode under the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, there are countless pairs of eyes sneaking into Richard’s military camp, but the army has never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, when the sè was bright, Richard led the army to set off, and only took more than 100 kilometers to stop. Then the next day passed quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the floating island giants of the Holy Alliance are no longer able to sit still, and the heads of the major families hold secret meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting continued from dusk to dawn, so that these veteran lords who are not weak are also exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners have long reached a consensus and must fight with Richard, but one thing has never been able to talk together, that is who is forward? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was open until dawn and no conclusions were reached. Perhaps everyone has a certain conclusion in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush of the thousand-ride configuration is unstoppable, and the legendary strongman is not afraid to approach. So against Richard, who is at the forefront, who is a dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts of the family understand that there will be no result in how many times this matter will be discussed. When he had to scatter, the Duke of Iron and Blood was the last to leave the venue, but overnight he was like a sudden old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is still advancing step by step, marching strictly in accordance with the established itinerary and route, just as if he was afraid that his opponent could not find his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
