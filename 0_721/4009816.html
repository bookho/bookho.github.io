			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is now round like a ball, and the proportion of the rest of the body It looked very uncoordinated, and even the carapace was opened by the abdomen, and several transparent wings were found out of the gap. But seeing those short wings and looking at the deformed body of the mother's nest, everyone knows that these wings have become furnishings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has stopped, the abdomen is rapidly expanding and contracting, and the body begins to make a loud squeak, and there are countless cracks on the dark black carapace. Then the crack is getting wider and wider, and a thick yellow unidentified body fluid is constantly emerging from the gap. When these body fluids come into contact with the air, they turn into a group of mists. When the transpiration is not more than one centimeter, the body quickly solidifies and the color gradually turns black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them, including Richard, felt that their eyes seemed to be a little dazzling because the mother nest was significantly larger than it was just now. Richard suddenly felt the pain in his eyes, the tears involuntarily flowed down, and the skin that was exposed to the outside also had a burning feeling. Although most of the fog has solidified, there is still a small part that spreads out in the room. The air is already filled with a faint mist, which seems to be strongly corrosive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nest is ringing again: "Master, I will produce a lot of acid mist when growing, please leave here temporarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately took the crowd out of the small building, far away from more than ten steps, sour mist is still pouring from the door. The sand drifting used the magical technique to disperse the acid erosion effect of several people, and everyone felt comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not see that behind the huge body of the mother's nest, a group of wreckage was being quickly eroded by a large amount of acid, and the acid mist in the room was mostly from this. The pile of debris is emitted. That is what the mother's nest does not want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the wreckage left only a pool of blackened embers, and no longer see what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the acid mist is exhausted, the mother's nest has also completed another growth, this time it has increased by half a meter in length, width and height, and the overall look is more rounded. Identify the head and tail. However, although the body grew up, the limbs and the blade did not grow up, and now it seems small and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to try to leave the house, but for the current body shape, the door has become too narrow to allow the huge abdomen to pass. The mother's nest made a scream of anger, and the force slammed forward, and the door frame fell out. The wall on the other side was collapsed. The ceiling on the second floor collapsed, and the second floor was on the street. The windows and a small balcony, a pile of masonry wood buried it below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest shook his body and climbed out of the rubble. This shock can't hurt it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stepping knights attracted by the collapsed sound saw the mother's nest, suddenly shocked, while shouting the police, while posing a defensive posture, blocked the passage The intersection of the base center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard came over and stood by his mother's nest. He knocked on his carapace with his hand and said to the two step knights: "Okay. Don't worry! This is the mother's nest, it is my contract creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two stepping knights look at each other, the situation in front of them makes them feel difficult Confidence. Seeing that Richard stood beside the huge worm that was almost equal to himself, a stepping knight couldn’t help but twitch and said, "Yes, Richard. But... you seem to be better off that thing." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
