			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the eyes of Xiao Licha, the world around is already a digital one. world. After the initial chaos, Richard has now begun to learn how to use these numbers. For example, under real talent, Richard can accurately perceive the total number of magic possessed by an ordinary first-level magician, so he defines these magic powers as 10, which is used as a reference. His current magic is equal to 8. But at this time he still does not know the meaning of this endless move. This is the beginning of the dataization of the magic system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for magical power of fireball is 15, and the magical demand for general three-level magic is around 20. Richard is now clear that less magical demand, greater power and simple way of casting are the keys to fireball's emergence in many low-level magic. However, in the process of magic casting, there will inevitably be a small amount of magical loss and waste, and a magician can not consume all the magic power at one time, which will cause serious damage to the body. Therefore, Richard instinctively realized that there is still much room for improvement in the standard fireball technique. After a few nights of sleepless research, Xiao Licha found that after several improvements, the magical consumption of fireball can actually be reduced to 8, if the entire casting process is perfect, and the three-second casting time is not omitted at all. . Reducing the magical power will also reduce the power of fireball, but when the mana cost is reduced to 8, the power of the original 15 energy levels will only drop to 10 levels, from the magical damage of the unit magic. Fireball is obviously superior. And compared with the power of up to 5 levels of other first-level magic, fireball still has an overwhelming advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiosity is the devil, and Richard began to try fireball on the second night, and it was successful for the first time. Looking at the steel ball that was obviously smaller than the normal fireball, and the color was bright red, the fireball slowly flew to the steel doll twenty-five meters away. Richard was nervous and almost stopped the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball blasted open, and the flame sputtered around the ring, and Richard also felt a rush of hot air. Under the double blow of high man and explosion, the steel dolls directly hit by the fireball are all deformed as a whole, and there are some magical flames on them. This steel doll is made with reference to the defensive power of the half-length plate armor, and has the function of detecting the magic power. It is conceivable that if a soldier wearing a half-length plate is standing there, then this fireball must have already killed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first level of magic that Little Richard has released since his birth, and the great joy instantly drowns him. He wanted to scream and cheer, but his legs were soft and fell on the wall. His body was empty in an instant, and it seemed that every part of the body no longer listened to his own command, and even a finger could not be lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the price of a successful spell, Xiao Li spent the second half of the night on the cold floor. At the same time as the first real magic in life, Xiao Li also realized for the first time the taste of the magic completely exhausted. Richard, who has exhausted all the magic, has no possibility of meditation, and can only wait quietly for the passive reply of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you lie down for three hours and six minutes, the magic will automatically return to 1, and the ‘precision’ talent will again give an accurate answer based on the magic recovery rate. At that time, Richard could stand up and begin to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more than three hours of waiting for the magic and physical recovery, Richard was bored and simply began to think carefully about the magical knowledge he had learned. He found that higher mental power can indeed reduce the magic consumed by the same magic. This is because the higher the mental strength, the more subtle the manipulation of the magic, so that a magic can be improved in many ways. Those super-magic skills require a certain amount of mental power to use. For example, fireball, Richard feels that there are still many places to improve in the recent casting process, at least ... 16 places. Four of them can save magic, three can increase power, and so on. After weighing, Richard chose to first consider the part that can save magic consumption. Next, it is a long and boring calculation. At this time, Richard discovered the importance of mathematics. After a full half-hour calculation, Richard finally succeeded in finding a point of improvement. Now his magical fireball cost has been reduced to 7, but the power has not been reduced accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that he can stand still after the fireball, even a few steps, rather than being as soft as it is now. The ‘precision’ talent also brings the same benefits, that is, Richard can accurately grasp his own situation, and even if he finds enough reference standards, he can also digitize his mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Little Richard’s heart was filled with joy for the first time. He couldn’t wait to recover the magic and try to improve the fireball. . The joy of exploration and discovery is so great that it is the first sunshine that the little Richard, who has been surrounded by the gloom, has seen. For the first time, Little Richard discovered that the world of magic is so magical and complex, and it is so vast that it is impossible to explore one of the corners of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic slowly accumulates and finally reaches 1. Richard struggles to walk into the meditation room, drink a bottle of magic to restore the potion, and then begins to meditate. A few hours later, just as the magic was about to fill up, Richard couldn’t wait to rush out of the meditation room and fired a fireball again at the broken steel doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the fireball formed between the hands, the magic in Richard's body quickly dropped, and was sucked in the blink of an eye. The fireball trembled and disappeared, but finally left Richard's hands and flew to the steel doll. The experiment was successful again. The improvement method that Richard found was effective, but the mood was too excited during the casting process, which led to a small embarrassment, which increased a little magic consumption. So when the fireball was shot, Richard stumbled again. Fortunately, the bottle of magic recovery agent is long-term, can speed up the magic recovery speed in a day, so now Richard can sit on the ground for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hour, Richard spent the constant calculations. When he stood up, the sky was already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's course is magic mathematics. Richard first listened so seriously, and even really saw the beauty from countless boring numbers. Richard is not a metamorphosis like Foggia, not even a paranoid, but the role of mathematics. And he lives in the world of numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole day of the course, Little Richard’s brain is always running at high speed, completely tireless. The content of the course is not difficult to understand, but seeing other students either in a state of sorrow or hard thinking seems to be not as simple as what Richard feels. It seems that the wisdom given by Lulu Aleusia is still effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day is the end of the month. When Richard returned to his own area, the young magician apprentice who had taken him to the dark blue had been waiting for him at the door. When she saw Richard, she greeted her and smiled and handed a light silver metal badge to Richard’s hand, saying that this is the income and expenditure of Richard this month, which can be found on the laboratory’s alchemy platform. Check, you can also use magic to stimulate, you can see the contents inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s appearance is very sweet, and her manners are also unique. Just standing there quietly, it will naturally reveal a feminine temperament. Richard took the badge, looked at her, said thank you, and then walked into the regional gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two thick and shiny doors that shined with metal luster slowly closed in front of them, and the girl stunned. She used the magic to open the doors of the two doors, but knew that there was a magic array protection on the door made of anti-magic metal, not to mention the acid arrow in her area, which is the sixth level solution. This is not the door to the surgery. The two metal doors are worth a lot, not to mention the area behind. Even if it is just an open space, the land is worth the price of the land in the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You guys have seen it twice, how can I not even ask my name?" The girl whispered angrily. She immediately remembered that according to the information, Richard seemed to be just ten years old. This age is too big for the beginning of a magical career, but it is too small for men. So she could only helplessly shake her head and hate to leave. But what is the solution? If Richard really has the man's ability, then it is too late to start, it is impossible to get her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
