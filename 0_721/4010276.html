This is enough to keep up with the speed of the food delivery. The piles of energy-rich food into the abdomen, most of which immediately turned into a hot stream, absorbed by Richard. The speed of digestion depends on Richard's physique, and now Richard's digestive ability is inherited from the Hydra, which is beyond imagination and makes Philip also appreciative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal, Richard feels more tired than the original and Bally Baal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lunch is finally over. Richard is as uncomfortable as a fire. He feels like he has swallowed a whole dragon. At this time, he was already stunned by the fire, and he could not even speak. Just faintly heard that Philip said that he had to order a hundred magic rides, he fell on the table and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long I have slept, and Richard slowly wakes up, but my eyes are still open, but my eyes are still blank, and I have a focus after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a luxurious to almost vulgar bedroom, the bed is big enough to sleep next elephant. The main color is golden, and the dazzling colorful colors are dotted with them. Whether it is the carvings and patterns on the furniture, or the glittering embellishments on the fabric, they are real gold and precious stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure that has grown into a young man is actually not too small, but when he put it on the bed, he was immediately overwhelmed by a large number of lace pillows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt sore and soft, and he had no strength at all. When he first ate the Hydra, he was not so uncomfortable. He struggled to sit up and his head immediately felt a sharp pain. The main consciousness has been unsustainable, and the second consciousness is still tirelessly studying the sacred fighting techniques. The result is to double the headache of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He banged his head hard, and suddenly there were a few pieces of things falling in front of him, and it turned out to be a few nails! He was shocked and hurriedly looked at his hands. He saw that most of the ten-finger nails had fallen off, and the remaining two pieces were shaken so badly that they also fell off their fingertips. The original nails only left a piece of pink soft meat, and it is still creeping and growing. After a while, the new nails grew out, crystal clear, but still a little soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little surprised, trying to touch the newborn nails, and the result was a piece of skin from his hand. More than just the palm of his hand, Richard casually slammed on his arm, which was a large piece of dead skin. However, the place where the suede has grown has long been new, not only delicate, but also dense and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the bedroom is the bathroom. The huge bathtub is for a group of people, and it is filled with water. The hot water from the faucet above the bathtub continuously flows into the bathtub. But the water in the tank is still not full, it seems to have flowed away from another place. This way, the water in the bathtub is kept at a constant temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looks like a burning fire, and his throat is too dry to say anything. He struggled to jump out of bed, grabbed the water bottle on the cupboard, and poured a large bottle of water into his throat, which made him feel better. And the body began to have a piece of suede, and Richard simply took off his clothes and soaked himself into the bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water temperature was just right, so that Richard finally felt comfortable, and began to check the state of the body. The blood is in good condition and the structure is intact. The magic has actually increased. Although it is an accident, it is indeed a good thing. **... Richard took a look at his body and found that his power had increased dramatically, almost doubled directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard was not known for his strength, the power of doubling was incomparable to the powerful races such as the ogre, but the benefits of increased power were tangible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fighting techniques could not be done in the first place, and can now be easily achieved, and with the improvement of the basic strength, the bonus effect of the magical armed forces is also increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second consciousness has already solved the sacred fighting technique to more than half, but with the improvement of Richard's power, the distance is completely resolved and it has become indefinite. However, Richard himself estimated that the level of sacred fighting is now very close to that of Io, but it is even worse than the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard was finally fully awake, and his physical discomfort almost disappeared. He now understands what is going on. Philip’s lunch didn’t know what to do. The food contained so much power, and Richard actually ate too much. As a result, digesting these foods almost exceeded his body’s ability. The limit of the burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing the increased power on his body, Richard knew that the meal was worth a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a reward for the royal family to make a successful life? If so, the rewards are too rich. That life is not for the royal family, but for the white night. Even if you provide life to the royal family in the future, you will also be charged. And obviously, the ingredients that increase physical fitness by eating are more precious than the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crawled out of the bathtub, dried his body, dressed, and looked out at the window of the bedroom. From the view of the scenery in the floating area of ​​the city, you should see it on the floating island on the fifth floor. Obviously, this is the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time just passed the night, but Richard was mentally awkward and couldn’t sleep. So he rang the bell that summoned the waiter, and the result came the emperor's courtier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier said: "The villain has been waiting outside for a long time, and he said, you are expected to wake up at this time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your command?" Richard vaguely remembered that the emperor had to order a batch of magic rides, but at that time the mind was groggy and naturally needed to confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your confession has two things. One is to let you be careful in the future. There may be other two empires, even people of other races to concede you, the alliance. The inside will be relatively calm. In addition, your Majesty is ready to order a hundred magic rides, but I hope that you can correct the short life limit, it is best to have a natural life of about ten years."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard’s expression on his face has not changed, but his heart has moved slightly. The meaning of the Emperor’s knees is to determine that the life span of the magic ride is artificial and accurately determine the normal time limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier continued: "The price can be raised to 120,000. This is just the first order, and you want to form a brand new demon cavalry regiment. How much is such a magic ride? Now that you are staying up late, you can't disturb, he told me that if you wake up, you can send you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He remembered that there was a Vatican priest to see, but it was obviously not the right time in the middle of the night, so he said to the courtier: "Okay, I am going back to Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the floating island, Li Chau went to the study and found cocoa on the stairs. Cocoa appeared to be a bit flustered. After seeing it, it was more like being scared. He immediately stood on the wall and did not dare to say a word. Richard felt a bit strange. He remembered that he had let the old butler put the cocoa back. Why is she still here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that Richard is no longer concerned about these little things, he just turned to Cocoa and went upstairs and entered his study. At the moment, on the wall of the study, there is a map of the territory of the Holy Alliance, which is marked with the various territories that belonged to Gotton. As can be seen from the map, in addition to the land around the Black Rose Castle, the territory of Gordon is quite scattered, and the east is a piece of west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of land represents the trajectory of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon and Goliath have the same father, and when their father died in the ecstasy, Goliath inherited the title and territory. Although Gordon also inherited a piece of jazz territory, he sold it together with the castle on the day he got it, and then took only one armor and left the family to become a free Archimonde warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following years, Gordon began to reveal his ambiguity, constantly gaining a piece of land, and ultimately from nothing, to the title of the Marquis, which matches the strength. A legendary experience has been achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this map, Richard couldn’t help feeling the heavy pressure. He didn't know if he could achieve the same achievement if he got along with the Gordon translocation. Now, Richard has only received the foundation left by Gotton, and he feels heavy pressure and deep exhaustion. However, it is through this process that Richard discovered that he seemed to touch some of the essence of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, no matter what the situation, is fearless. Therefore, he dares to take risks, dare to attack, dare to pursue everything he wants, and dare to take on countless responsibilities with his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and stood in front of the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the map, many territories have been marked with a floating mark, indicating that the local lord is shaking or has essentially begun to resist the order. The names of other territories are grayed out, meaning that the control of these territories has been lost. There are also many signs of sacrifices on the territory, which was the family branch that was involved in the looting of sacrifices. Finally, a few pieces of land were also marked with a gimmick, and Richard was determined to take the opportunity to uproot the local lord family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after seeing this map, you can roughly know what Richard is going to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indulging, if the cost of the Faro plane is too expensive, the big army inside can’t adjust, he’s already flattened these small The lord. But now, instead of worrying about it, he is considering whether to let these guys be active for a while, and then expose more, including the support behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not too big to wait for the effect. After all, after Richard’s release of life, the entire Holy Alliance will know that Richard leads to the Holy Spirit. The road to the division has been paved, and there is not much to dare to do small moves at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard repeatedly weighed the pros and cons, the magic light in the room did not sway, but the shadow on the ground fluctuated wildly. A shudder of meaning climbed up the spine and slashed the top of the head. That was the natural reaction that Richard perceived the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: I finally finished the Seventh, and proved that seven times a night is not a legend. However, tomorrow, it should be said that the update at noon today is gone, postponed to the evening. As for the reasons, you all know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a fierce battle coming, it can’t be written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
