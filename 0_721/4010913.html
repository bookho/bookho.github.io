			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s view, this harshly worded night is actually equivalent to disguise The weakness of the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sacred dynasty is really tough, then what else to explain, just send out the troops. Just as Richard confronts Brahms, directly sending troops to destroy your main force, occupying all your territories, and then slowly 'investigating' the whereabouts of the gods Mujin, this is called toughness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a natural tacit understanding between the nobility, like this one is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote a letter on the spot, then called the attendant's mage, asked him to find a messenger, and sent the letter to the Holy Tree Dynasty. It is of course impossible for the messenger to pass the ultra-long-range transmission method, which is too expensive and takes too little time on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard looked at the disc, he knew that the lords of the sacred dynasty wanted to delay the time, which is exactly what he would like to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the messenger sent by Richard will ride on the lion's lion, but the flight time is limited every day. After about ten days, the response to the wanted will be sent to the cabinet of the Holy Tree Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response, Richard certainly denied the accusation against himself, pointing out that the Marquis of Brahms died of a fire. This is an accidental death and cannot be counted on Archimonde's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a response, just like Brahms’s response to Richard, was a ridiculous lie. Unsurprisingly, the Holy Tree Dynasty will also be sent overnight, which will refute Richard's statement and ask for a new explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Richard explained that the dynasty reprimanded. If it is a few round trips, the months have passed. In the case that both sides have decent and steps, it is time to reconcile with the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the attendant left, the Richard put the matter aside. It seems that St. Martin is still quite capable. I don't know how to do it. It really delays the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard still can’t figure out what St. Martin’s real intentions are, even the enemy and friends are not clear, but at least so far, and The young, sunny, glamorous Son worked happily together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard raised his hand and a few light spots appeared in his palm, and then gathered into a soft light. This is the light of the Lord of glory, and the source of the magical teachings of the priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the golden sè flame of Archangel Michael, or the blood of the Battle of Midrand, it is essentially from this group. Light. It is precisely because Richard has mastered the power of the Holy Light that he can drive the battle version of Midalun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This holy light does not come out of thin air. Its source is the emblem of the shining Lord from St. Martin to Richard. The emblem of the god is the original divine power of the glory of the Lord, and Richard relies on the true talent to see the trajectory of the divine power, and analyzes it with the powerful computing power of the wisdom talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of time, although the analytical model of the lord of the glory has just been established, from the perspective of rule control, Richard has already touched the light of the light. rule. The use of the power of the Light is no longer under the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that what Saint Martin gave to Richard is really valuable. For Richard, no matter whether wealth or equipment is no longer a problem, what he lacks is at least the core material of the small lord level, and the power of various powerful rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha closed his hand and put away the light. With the power of the Light, in the future, when dealing with the priests of the Glorious Church, the light is the strong anti-xìng, and Richard will have a huge advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up another piece of information, and the envelope of the information was marked with a scarlet exclamation mark. He took the information and looked at it, his face condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin two pages, Richard repeatedly read it several times before putting it down. He thought for a while, and in a consciousness let a knight knight call Axiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axiris entered the study, and Richard handed the two pieces of stationery to him. When the dark god official saw it, his face changed a little and said, "Is Firefox still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "This is the Marquis of Sauron." Information sent by people. It is said that in the southern part of the Millennium Empire, someone once saw the whereabouts of Firefox. He seems to be moving towards the sand sea. I remember that many of the clues of the Wald family and children were directed at Firefox. I was not able to find his whereabouts at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris took a deep breath and said, "Yes. The power of Firefox is not outstanding. He is only a sacred killer, but he is extremely powerful in disguise and absconding. It is very difficult to find him. The people of the Deer family are the instructors from Firefox. But not only Wald, but also Senma, and both Kailan and Capita have had similar experiences, and there is also the shadow of Firefox behind the scenes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Yang raised his eyebrows and said, "So, he is the thirteen knight against his father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No. I feel that Firefox is just an ordinary performer. He should have someone else behind him. He should be directed at Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Father's enemy..." Richard smiled and smashed the two pages into a ball and threw it into the paper basket. He said slowly: "With the father's xìng grid, the enemy is not I know that there are no ways, and there is no need to check them one by one. After all, this matter has been going on for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Richard is silent, and the raging fire in memory once again appears in his mind. Gordon’s recklessness at a young age gave him the glory of breaking through the night forest, but he also lost Ilanni forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and freed himself from the memories, then said: "We will not trace this matter, but it does not mean that Since the fire fox is so active, he will not think about it for the rest of his life! Now Archimonde is no longer the father of Archimonde. No one can be safe after hurting us. "Things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and squatted back and forth in the study, then stopped in front of Asiris and said, "Since you are It is said that Firefox is very difficult to entangle, then we will hand it over to the experts to deal with him! Asiris, in the top three killer organizations in Noland, have released a reward, I am willing to buy Firefox's head with 5 million gold coins!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five million!" Achilles took a deep breath and flashed his face, saying, "I understand. Tomorrow. At this time, the reward for Firefox will appear on the list of major killers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head, said: "Although we can't catch the guys behind the scenes, but killing the firefox, they will find it harder to find other running dogs."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a waitress knocked on the door of the study and said, "His Royal Highness is a dispatch from the dark blue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese smiled and said: "It seems that Black Gold has to surprise me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant Master sent in a thick envelope with hundreds of The drawings are all designed for the dark night jīng spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a heavy-duty mattress that needs to be used by the entire team, as small as a pendant that can be loaded onto the weapon, each with a detailed design. And now the dark blue masters know the minimum requirements of Richard, everything can be mass-produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it one by one and spent a whole hour looking through all the plans. Achilles is also full of praise for these designs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These equipments are practical, simple, easy to maintain, and have a good power. Moreover, either the materials that can be purchased in large quantities or the special materials that can be produced in large quantities by Richard's private planes are used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, handcuffs, instead of using the common high-elastic xìng wire twisted bow arm, the wood is selected. This kind of wood is excellent in strength and is a special kind of tree produced by Green Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li gave the design to Axiris and said, "You run it yourself, go to Nolan, let her workshop on the ground." I also do my best to produce these equipments. I need to order a thousand sets first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand sets of equipment means a thousand dark nights. This is a powerful fighter with at least fifteen levels! I believe that the people of Noland can hear this number and no one can calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Achilles did not ask, he was very clear about what he could know and what he should not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Achilles left, Richard stood in front of the magic map and meditated for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he found that he was still able to move out of the space for about seven days, and he could do something he wanted to do. So Richard rang the magic bell and let people call Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
