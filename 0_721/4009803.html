But now is not the time to care about this issue, so Richard asked: "I heard that when the plane was opened up, everyone in this plane would regard us as an enemy. Is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand sand nodded again and said: "And the large-scale plane shuttle, for example, a team like ours, will definitely cause the strong face of the plane to master the rules of the plane. If this plane The power limit is exactly what you said, that is, there are a few planes with legendary power in the secondary plane, then our situation can be very bad. What are you going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you going to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha secretly smiles, how to struggle, and when the real strongmen arrive, there is no chance for them to have this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, not only the sand, two ogres, Gangde, water, elves, poets, are looking at Richard, waiting for him to make a decision . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stunned and once again clearly realized that he was the leader of this team, even if it was not because of the suppression of power, there was a soul contract and magic slavery. The existence of the contract also made him a natural center. Originally, with the strength of his hands, and the advance team members who are familiar with the plane, it is not a problem to open the situation. However, now, to the high-end sub-plane, the first thing to consider is how to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the sand and asked a key question: "Do we have a way to go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are three methods. First, occupying the entire plane. At that time, there will be enough resources, and I will be able to build a tower of time that can explore the coordinates of the outer plane. Second, luck is good enough to find an eternity. The temple that was forgotten with the Dragon of Time. After re-enabling the temple, we can sacrifice to pray for grace and open the plane to return to Noland. Finally, it happens that there is also a team of pioneers from Noland. Arriving at this plane, and then we are caught, so that we can get back the coordinates." Flowing sand said faintly, as the priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple, she is obviously more familiar with the plane than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around again for a week and suddenly raised his voice and said, "I really want to be lucky enough to find an eternal dragon temple and then I can escape to Nolan." De. But, even if you find the Dragon Hall, where are we going to sacrifice now? Is it enough to dedicate to the sacrifice of the Eternal and Time Dragon, is it more difficult to get a piece of the world? The sacrifice sent here is the head of a great demon! And since I have come here, as an Archimonde, I don’t want to flee back so vainly! So, I am willing to choose the first method. In fact, this is our only choice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is getting louder and louder, and the word Archimonde seems to have a magical power. When it was said, all the people were a little excited and no longer look like they were uncertain. And Richard himself suddenly found that when the syllables of Archimonde were spit out, the blood in the depths of the body and mind was also swaying and leaping, eager for the days when blood and fire were intertwined. The first to cheer up, but to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gangde suddenly shouted loudly: "Hey! Head, your knife is very handsome in battle! But when it comes to pre-war mobilization, I think if you If you drink a few more drinks, you will be more powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly looked at Gangde and said for a long time: "You are not nervous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde shrugged and said: "There was something really scary, but I think the environment in the death camp is much more dangerous than it is now. At that time, every living thing you see may have your life. Since even the little girl is not afraid, what am I afraid of?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water flower holding a long knife, leaning against the wall, eyes half open and half closed, as if to fall asleep, did not pay attention to the provocation of Gangde. She was white and red, and she looked very eye-catching everywhere. But looking at her, I don't care about the current environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the two ogres again, and grasped his head in three points. Weng said with anger: "I am afraid that there is no good." "Things to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu raised a huge fist and slammed a fist in the back of the three-pointed, yelling: "You always I know that it is delicious! If there is an ogre in this plane, it will be perfect! After laying down their tribe, the most beautiful ten food eater demons are mine! You pick from the eleventh!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-pointer jumped up and snarled: "Impossible! Let you pick one at most!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am a magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician does not work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the moment The two ogres who clashed and started to cross each other's neckline, Richard looked at Oral again. The elf bard is still a pale face at this time, and I don’t know if it is too much blood to recover after the injury, or the fear of my heart. Seeing Richard's gaze, he barely smiled, but did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral hesitated for a while, looked at the sand, and finally got the courage, saying: "If the beautiful Miss Sands can give me an encouragement, say one Sweet kiss, then I will have endless courage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand smiles lightly and says: "If you sing the priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall, you are not afraid of shortening your life. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural, I dare not continue this topic. He began to look for new sources of courage. This time he said to the water flower: "If the beautiful Miss Shuihua can give me some reward, my courage will be enough to conquer the whole plane!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Splash suddenly lashes twice, opens one eye, glances at the elf poet, and faintly says, "Well, when the environment is right."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural suddenly swelled a layer of flushing, and he excitedly opened his arms to the scorpio, like to hug something, then turned to Richard on one knee and shouted: "Master! You I have harvested one of the most brave warriors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really ignorant of what to say, he has a soul contract with the water flower, and can also vaguely perceive the girl’s idea. And the water flower doesn't seem to have anything to blame for him. He pushes the mind that he wants in the heart. That can be a picture of cutting and cutting. However, it seems that it is not appropriate to tell the romantic poet in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that it was so difficult to bring a team. I really don't know how Gordon got together the thirteen costume knights. From Modred to Lina, they are all full of personality, and every one is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
