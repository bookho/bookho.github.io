			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the surveillance room, Su Hailun is leaning on the sofa lazily. Scroll through the test report. In fact, she has already seen every item above, but I have to read it again. This is both an affirmation of the work of dozens of mages and a monitoring of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The abilities are very average, there are no clear shortcomings, and there are no specific strengths. Spiritual power... Well, it’s ok. The body proportion is OK, grow up. I should be able to see... a lot of abdominal muscles... very flexible, good endurance... other... no?” Su Hailun looked up from the report and stared at the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her gaze, the ** division who has reached the level of the 18th level of the magical level has a cold war without a reason, respectfully said: "This is The most comprehensive test we have been able to achieve so far, the total cost is 116,000 Imperial gold coins. All the test results are here, and no other special talents have been found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As for some of the words that Su Hailun just said when he muttered to himself, he automatically chose to ignore and forget. The genius who can cultivate to the 18th level is not enough to explain the wisdom they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyebrows began to come together: “According to his talent, at most it can be cultivated to the 18th level! Nothing is too big!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18th level 'no big use' of the magician listened carefully, the smile on his face did not change, from the beginning to the end of the true humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! The blood of his body belonging to Archimonde is very powerful and pure, even stronger than the little Gotton. Well, this is a bit strange... .... Perhaps the result of being stimulated by the silver moon elves. But how can there be no other special talents?" Su Hailun's two small eyebrows are tightly twisted together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magister seriously said moderately: "Acmemond belongs to the upper blood, and if you want to test your blood talent, it is beyond our ability."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense!" Su Hailun angered, "I clearly remember that there are at least six ways to detect the upper blood talent! It is also possible to determine the top bloodline! How important is the upper blood? Do you want me to remind you again?! What are you doing, my gold coins are thrown into the dog! Since he is likely to have a blood talent, it should be tested at all costs, not at all Need to ask me! Do you understand my words, at any cost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cheapest method, the experimental cost is also more than 600,000 imperial gold coins. "The magician who understood it quietly reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then forget it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know these little behind the scenes After the episode, after being taken to his own area, he suffered a day of torture and he immediately fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dream, he returned to the village of Rutherland, carrying a heavy breadfruit and going home. The warm little building is already far away, and the mother is waiting for herself at the door. Far from the smell of baked pie, it shows that he can finally get rid of the glutinous and unsweetened breadfruit this evening. Xiao Lichai flew up happily, only to see her mother smiled at herself, then turned and walked into the small building. In a twinkling of an eye, the flames are ejected from every window! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly sat up and screamed, trying to move forward. Finally, he saw the environment he was in, so the sweat rushed out and soaked the pajamas. He gasped with a big mouth and his chest was heavy like a lead, almost suffocating. Richard slowly looked up and saw himself lying on a gorgeous big bed. The bed is incredibly big, at least five or six people can sleep at the same time. The size of the bedroom is also very large. Richard just glanced at it and immediately got accurate data from the line of sight. This is a huge space of 20*15 meters, plus a ceiling six meters high from the ground, lying here. Richard felt that he was like a lonely boat floating in the sea. The size of the bedroom is already larger than the village head's home. Richard can't imagine why such a large space would only be used for one person to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, went out of bed and began to observe everything in the bedroom. It’s been a month since the fire, and Richard has been forcing himself to forget everything that happened that day. His thoughts are a little naive, thinking that as long as he forgets, one day his mother will come back. But as soon as this thought came up, he immediately forced himself to believe it, and now he regards it as a kind of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings of the bedroom are equally luxurious, and the selection of the decorations is in the style of a magician and a nobleman. And Richard found that as long as he looked at what he was looking at, he would get a lot of data about that thing, and the data could be accurate to two decimal places. That is the ‘real’ talent that I got from enlightenment. I don’t know what happened during the test, but it stimulated it to grow to the second level: “accurate”. When "precise" appeared, Richard faintly felt its third and fourth layers of ability, which can analyze the internal structure of the object and analyze the material. But the ability to develop to a higher level doesn't know when it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard does not understand what the use of ‘real’ is, but first finds that he is immediately overwhelmed by numbers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything he sees, there are countless numbers of data, thousands of numbers coming in at the same time, and even giving him some illusion. For example, a chair is composed of one hundred and one data, which describes its length, width and height, the degree of curvature of the surface, and so on. Of course, if Richard is willing, these numbers can be increased by tens of thousands of times. For example, the satin of the back of the chair is made up of countless fibers. The soft skin on the armrests has many small scales that are invisible to the naked eye. It is firm and tough and seems to be the skin of some kind of dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But living in a world of numbers is never pleasant, and Little Richard feels that his head is almost blasted by endless data. Fortunately, the wisdom of ascension seems to have a role at the same time, so that Xiao Li quickly sorts the countless data, thus screening out most of the useless data, only the most important and most needed numbers are retained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, Little Richard is fighting countless data, trying to reduce the number of them, but also to ensure that the real important things are not ignore. Unconsciously, the sky will light up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first day that Xiao Licha officially became a student of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of study is mainly to lead Richard to know the whole dark blue, where is his area, where is the public facilities that can be used, and where is the restricted area, How to apply for all kinds of materials, who to look for when needed, and some general considerations. What surprised Richard most was his area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the area, this term is very accurate and fits perfectly with his precise talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the huge bedroom, he also has an independent magical laboratory group, which consists of a major general-purpose laboratory and six specialized experiments. Room composition. In addition, the living area is composed of eleven different-use rooms. For example, a room dedicated to the coat is very difficult to understand. He now has all the clothes, a small box is enough to hold it, and most of the clothes are still ordered by Gordon to be specially prepared for him. In the true sense of his personal belongings, except for a necklace that his mother left him, all the magic books that accompanied him through his childhood were turned into ashes in the fire. The high-level ritual uses the fire of life as a fuel, and the destructive power is comparable to that of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
