The other big magisters were much more depleted in the daytime battles than they were. They were just resting, and they had to run out to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chaos of the barracks subsided, Raymond stood in the wounded battalion and looked at a painful warrior. Most of these soldiers suffered from skin injuries. After the dressing, even if there were no priests and pastors, they could recover their fighting power after a few days of rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the medical officer walked to Raymond and lowered his voice and said: "Raymond, the detoxification agent has been used up, but there are still hundreds of people who need to detoxify. I suggest that you build an indigenous city tomorrow, and there should be antidote in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is struggling with inner strength, and there is no sound at the moment. After a while, he pointed to some of the warriors lying down and asked, "I remember that they all used detoxification drugs. How did it seem to have no effect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;医The official smiled and said: "The toxicity of feather snakes is the strongest, and the toxicity of feather snakes here is also very strange. Our detoxification effect is greatly reduced. It is not easy for them to maintain the status quo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond nodded, no longer looking at these fighters, but went to the big camp, commanding all the magic archers to split into two, and must have half of the night and half rest in the evening. And from now on, all the magic archers are on alert, and must shoot anything flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the camp, Raymond slammed his fist on the table and squeezed a word from his teeth: "Le Richard!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, Raymond’s intuition tells him that this is Richard’s work, although he does not know how Richard can command so many poisonous feather snakes. But this kind of combat technique, which is quite different from that of the indigenous people, allowed him to set his target directly on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard also paced back and forth in the camp, and repeatedly weighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Raymond’s camp has returned to silence, but the alert is stronger. Before, Richard directed several bats to try to get close to the snoop, but was immediately swept away by a wave of magical arrows, and even the elite bats were not spared. Richard has completely lost sight of what happened inside the military camp and can only peep outside the safe distance through elite bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to move in the camp, Richard suddenly made up his mind and immediately communicated to the mother’s nest: “Let all feather snakes replenish poison, before dawn Then launch an attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, the other party is already on guard. The feather snake has almost zero defense against the powerful magic arrow. This attack may be feathered. The snake will lose more than two-thirds." The mother's nest rarely expressed opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain of Richard is running wildly. He presses the forehead and suppresses the severe headache. He said: "The toxicity of feather snakes against Noland detoxification. What is the effect of the agent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest replied: “According to your request, I have optimized the toxicity of the Noord Universal Antidote to the feather snake. Ordinary antidote can only temporarily suppress the toxicity, but can not completely remove the toxins. In the absence of the purification treatment of the gods, they will slowly die within a few days. Only soldiers above the 12th level can slowly detoxify with the vindictiveness. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard took a heavy punch and squatted on the table and said, "That's good! Let the feather snake replenish the poison, and match it with a hundred non-toxic feather snakes to attract the attention of the other shooter. Launch the total attack tonight. All the feather snakes don't have to come back before the air sacs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, in the depths of the turbulent land, stand up a number A huge honeycomb of ten meters, this is the nest made by the mother nest. The surface of the nest is slowly creeping, as if it had its own life. A head feather snake flew from the deep night, hovering over the hive, and sucking a venom like a clear spring. For a time, the outer wall of the hive was covered with feather snakes, and the horror could not be said from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the venomous feather snake flew away from the worm nest, and a new batch of feather snakes immediately filled the position and continued to replenish the poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After midnight, all feather snakes make up the toxins. Then the brain split again and flew up to the far side of the darkness. The feathers of hundreds of winds or electric properties first set off, crossed the brain and marched toward Raymond's camp. Behind them, there are more than 300 poisonous feather snakes, which form a black cloud of black clouds that roll across the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly sat in the camp, handing over the command to the front of the brain, and he just waited quietly. He knows that this time, more than four hundred snakes will never return, and Raymond's magic archer is comparable to the archer of the illegal plane. But this will give the most serious blow to an opponent without a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacrifice may be the meaning of the Brood War Fighting Unit. But Richard is smart and calm, and he knows that he is deceiving himself. Because the humanoid knights look like humans, they are not willing to sacrifice them, and the feather snake is like a World of Warcraft, you can sacrifice at will? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from the difference in appearance, they are only the creation of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much is kindness in war because of life, how much is because of race, or simply because of the most deceptive appearance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy of Richard, on the one hand, is the army of Raymond, on the other hand, he is himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before waiting for the feather snake to fly to his destination, Richard has been thinking about how many personal styles and emotions should be mixed in the war. This is not achievable, it is really art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is going to light up, this time, the night is also the deepest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden anger in the barracks, and several brilliant magic arrows flew into the sky, accurately pinning the body of several feather snakes. The feathers immediately lost all signs of life and fell directly. The feathered snakes in the air immediately rioted, and they couldn’t care about distances and formations, all from the existing position and dive into the military camp. But more magic arrows fly into the sky with bright light, and more feathers are shot down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it was a cloud of black pressure that floated from the higher air to the top of the barracks very quickly. It was more feather snakes! They flew at full speed, and swooped to the barracks one by one, and the large group of poisonous fog slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military camp, one of the magic archers is trying their best to open the bow, archery, then open the bow, and then shoot the arrow, it is too late to add any magic effect. Several of the highest-ranking archers have given up their aiming action and released one after another of the range of lethal bursting magic arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are too many feather snakes in the air, and they don’t seem to have the fear of danger in the general World of Warcraft. They simply ignore the sharp arrows that are shot over the sky. The falling companions also seem to have no effect on them. They only want to smother the poisonous mist, even if the middle arrow falls and desperately open their mouths, it seems that the last drop of venom is also squeezed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things are crazy!" All the magic archers almost floated their thoughts in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are feathers and snakes falling all the time in the air, and there are poisonous fogs falling all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, all the feather snakes in the sky were shot, and most of the camps were shrouded in thick poisonous fog, and the big magisters finally joined forces. It has protected several important positions such as replenishment and central military accounts. The whistling of the wind began to sound. Only when the feathers and snakes were shot behind, the great mentors were lifted off to release the wind and blow away the poisonous fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the day to light up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked at the body of the feather snake that was dragged together, with no expression. Next to a general is thinking about the number of casualties just counted, a string of numbers in the ear, it is boring, but also harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the final conclusion made Raymond's face change: "What? The situation of the fighters who have served the antidote has deteriorated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general daringly said, "Yes. At present, only the officers of the 12th grade or above have alleviated the symptoms of poisoning."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder suddenly coughed fiercely, and there was an abnormal cyan on his face. The general was shocked and shouted: "Adult, are you poisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm fine. No poison can poison me." Raymond stood up straight The body, his face was paler, but his eyes flashed decisively, saying: "Gather all the poisoned warriors, leaving five hundred soldiers to take care of them. Others immediately start camp, now set off!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general glimpsed and immediately went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days, Raymond marched straight, and the tens of thousands of troops in the three principalities of the former road were all blown. Raymond did not stop, and he went to kill the blood. The number of warriors under his command has been less than 10,000, but the momentum has never been better, and it is better than when the first position is entered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the edge of the turbulent land, on the Gobi standing on top of a weathered stone column, Raymond finally saw his life's enemies, Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this small land, Li Chaguang has gathered more than 50,000 troops on the front, and laid down the dense work, while The back and the ambush were also laid out on the periphery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he saw Richard standing tall on the top of the hill, Raymond knew that it was the battlefield selected by Richard. At the time of his initial entry into the plane, the 30,000-strong army now has only more than 9,000 people, and the strong ones have lost two-thirds. Moreover, as soon as he came out of the portal that deviated from the three hundred kilometers, his army had become a lonely army and there was no retreat. If you don't pierce the defense line under Richard Chap, the team that has caused the indigenous side of the plane will become a rootless duckweed, and sooner or later it will fall under the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to see this point, and I kept the rush to the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the layout of the battlefield, Raymond knows that Richard is not only versatile in construction, but also in war, and is an opponent that rivals himself. . Moreover, Richard took advantage of the work, and at the expense of hundreds of incomparably precious feather snakes, he made the maximum use of the characteristics of the Raymond Expeditionary Force without a priest, and weakened Raymond’s army to an unprecedented degree. From this point of view, Richard seems to be better in strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
