			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not have figured out one thing, that is, no matter how much The giants support you, you are the same in my eyes as before, that is nothing! Well, the gods have been playing this farce for a long time, I don’t have much time to continue playing with you, or completely Your thoughts are good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard pointed to Ryan and shouted: "Expulsion!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Ryan’s head immediately emerged with a time hourglass, then broke and shattered, and the sand was sprinkled everywhere, and then turned into a pure time force, returning to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transparent, blistered mask immediately wraps Ryan. Ryan was horrified in the light bubble, constantly struggling and yelling, but no sound could be heard, and silence was scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the four great priests can see that Ryan’s divine power is rapidly fading, and then a broken hourglass mark appears and then falls into Ryan’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light bubble disappeared with Ryan in front of the four great officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Nolan, the four great priests were terrified, and even a syllable could not be sent out. They certainly know the magical expulsion used by Richard, which is why they are so afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because with Nolan Hirsch, none of the four priests have the ability to use expulsion. Spiritual expulsion requires sufficient authority before the Eternal and Time Dragon, and the ability to pay enough divine grace to remove the deportee's time and grace, no matter what the conditions, they do not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment their eyes are focused on the hourglass that emerges from the top of Richard’s head. Richard's time hourglass is still as gorgeous as ever, gorgeous and suffocating. What is different from what appeared in the Millennium Empire at that time was that the sand in the hourglass has been converted from gold to platinum! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these white gold sands have separated Richard from the four great gods. Richard cut off all of Ryan’s grace, and there was no striking change in his time hourglass! Maybe it’s a few times when the sand is missing, but who knows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Richard's time hourglass, the faces of the four priests were not so good. Obviously, they realized a frightening reality, and Richard's grace can completely expel them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more than a sè, a small mouth, completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not take back the hourglass, but said to him: "It seems that the lesson given to you last time is not enough! In my opinion, the Eternal Dragon Hall There are already four big priests in the room. Eliminate!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of Richard’s drink, the top of his head also shows his time hourglass, the hourglass immediately Cracked, the sand sprinkled out when it was a large piece, and it turned into the power of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out one-third of her time sand in one breath, and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is bleak, her power has been pushed to the 12th level. This level of divine power can only be regarded as a senior priest. Although Bian'an was marked with eviction, Eternal World can't enter the Eternal Dragon Hall to be strong, but for her, life is ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the hourglass was hidden, and Richard glanced at the remaining two great officials, and suddenly made their faces pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "If it weren't for the old dragon, I would need a few big priests to decorate the scene. I even pushed you to the 12th level!" But don't think that it will be fine in the future. If you let me find that you are doing some small moves behind the scenes, then you will not be polite. It is not easy to find a few people to fill in the two positions, but it is two sacrifices. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Richard did not wait for their reply, and walked outside the Temple of Eternal Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan followed up, and some said helplessly: "Richard, isn’t it necessary? This, it seems a bit too embarrassing."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "I hate trouble now, and I have no time to waste on those two idiots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of," the strength of our Dragon Temple has lagged behind the Millennium Empire and the Holy Tree Dynasty. If there are not enough big priests and gods, will it be more difficult to compete with them in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stopped and looked at Nolan and said seriously: "The gods are not what we want to have. They are the gods of the old dragon, not ours. If the old dragon needs it, Then the gods will naturally appear, and we don’t have to go to the heart. As for the dragon temple, which is better, it has no meaning at all, and it does not depend on the number of big gods, how strong the power is. For the old dragon, Which dragon temple can get more sacrifices, which dragon temple is more valuable, and the reward of grace will be more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan surprised Said: "In this case, does the existence of our big priests have no meaning at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said: "It means no meaning. But For you, it makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan understands, I don’t know what sent Ms. Richard out of the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately led the followers and the knights to the hall, and went straight to the fourth floor of the main hall under the black pressure of the nobles like cháo water. The transmission array to the floating island 3-1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When boarding the floating island, Richard discovered that it was much larger than it looked outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This floating island is more than a dozen square kilometers in size, and it is obviously using extremely sophisticated space technology. At the northern end of the floating island, there is a naturally standing mountain peak, and a temple is built on the summit. The style is exactly the same as those originally found in the fauna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard instinctively felt that the gift of the Eternal and Time Dragon should be in this temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed up the paved stone steps and walked into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is divided into two front and back, and the front hall is actually an altar of time. Obviously, here you can sacrifice directly to the Eternal and Time Dragon, without having to go to the Eternal Dragon Hall. The apse is much smaller, with only three quaint stone slabs, and an ancient scroll floating above them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to a stone platform and placed his hand on it. A large message immediately poured into his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shitai is the control device, and only the floating island brand given by the Eternal and Time Dragon can activate the opening. Each stone platform can form a time and space of dú lì, that is, it can be a part of a certain continent, or it can separate a certain area from the original plane dú lì, forming a special territory similar to the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This special territory actually exists in the three artifact scrolls floating on the stone platform. In other words, the 3-1 floating island can generate three special territories. The range of each special territory can be as large as a hundred kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following floating islands 3-2 and 3-3 have two separate pieces and one special territory. This special territory is actually a supplement to the lack of space on the floating island. It can be used to build special facilities and to place a large number of portals leading to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these special territories, Richard immediately thought of the use that was urgently needed. He can completely transform the two integral battlefields connecting the abyss and the Dragon Valley into special territories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, even if the reaper really appeared in Faro and eventually destroyed Faro, Richard could retain the two most valuable areas. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the special territory of hundreds of kilometers is also strong enough to fight, the special time to close the space, also allows Richard to effectively control these strong. At least not as much as in Faro, but also to worry about their running around, they must be separated to monitor their movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the special territorial function of the floating island solves the urgent needs of Richard. But the uneasiness in Richard’s heart is also much stronger. Laolong really supports him, but what will he pay in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, that's all about the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and immediately summoned the followers and briefly planned the use of the various areas on the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill is naturally built a family castle, surrounded by the core control temple, and protected. Then the transmission array, the guard camp, and the large number of houses for servants and guests need to be built one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-tiered floating island is different from other floating islands. There are special territorial control temples. Therefore, the guard force also needs to be greatly enhanced. Richard is preparing to be stationed on the floating island for a hundred knights and is led by at least one celestial sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take some time to build the floating islands. However, Richard now has a large number of masters, and if you build a normal building, you can finish it in a month. The interior decoration will take some time, but Richard doesn't care about it at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
