If you stay in the foreign domain for so long, you will become legendary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did all the giants choose to kneel down instead of no fixed length? Princess, the potential of His Majesty is stronger.” Richard asked another key question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Duke recalls the past, revealing a bitter smile, saying: "No, because everyone is afraid of the indefinite princess."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that year, looking at the whole human race, the indefinite princess is one of the best geniuses, she does not need to temper power, In the Sanctuary period, I began to comprehend the rules. In the absolute battlefield, there was more than one record of killing the legend. The level and bottleneck that plagued us did not seem to exist in her. However, the undecided princess is also a one. Undeducted madman, she is moody, the only hobby is to destroy life, destroy any life, no matter what kind of problem, her means of solving the problem is to kill, she often said that one sentence is to both sides of the quarrel Kill, no one will quarrel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent, indeed, if such a woman is put on the throne, it is definitely a disaster for the entire Holy Alliance. But such a woman turned out to be the last Chose to obey the rules, do not know they have that bit deep face what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After no distance to the foreign domain, a group of giants, even the royal family, seems to be completely rid of her shadow, chose to destroy all traces she has ever existed Including the records, the emblems and the literature, since then, the indefinite long princess has only lived in the memory of a group of old people. In people's minds, she should go to the foreign domain without a return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect that decades have passed, but at this time, this long-shocking princess suddenly killed and it’s a bit too clever. For politics, the synonym of coincidence is conspiracy. However, it is hard to imagine that Richard’s character, such as the princess and the turbidity, will be equated with a meticulous conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and the Duke of Iron and Blood chatted a few words and left the floating island of Dagong, and rushed to the Royal Masters Association of Faust, in the Masters Association. Among them, there is the largest and most complete library in the whole of the world, and Thor is certainly not the strongest of the legendary masters. But if you talk about knowledge, there are not many legendary masters who are richer than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Thor, the old man of the optimist also brought two thick black circles. He looked at him with a heavy heart. When he saw Richard, he barely squeezed a smile and said: "My old bottom can be Your magical armed forces are drained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "Your joke is not funny at all. I am not selling this time. But I want to look at a few books in the library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which kind of book." Thor asked and waved a young man. Master, let him take Richard to the library of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more information about the foreign domain, the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside domain,." Thor was taken aback and immediately let the mage leave, then stared at Richard and asked: "It is related to the undecided princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just I want to know more about her. There is almost no information about her. I think there should be a lot of opportunities to deal with this long princess in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor I looked at Richard and said, "Come with me. I have a book about the foreign domain. I have a very detailed explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee follows Tor Into his half-face, Thor placed a magical barrier, completely separated the half-face from Noland, and said, "Lee, are you ready to stop the indefinite?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "I don't understand the imperial court, I don't want to stop it. What's more, this time the succession of the throne is not related to Archimonde. I am not the Duke. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor took Richard to a three-story building deep in the semi-level, and pulled out a dusty box. The heavy book was given to Richard. "Get it, this is very detailed in the foreign domain. You can take it back and look at it slowly, but remember to give it back to me. The book itself is much more precious than the content. It was a personal master of a famous mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Richard was ready to leave, Thor stopped him and said, "Lecha, no decision In any case, His Royal Highness is the blood of the royal family. It is a member of our Holy Alliance. Some of the crises in front of us may only be resolved by her, and we must take care of the overall situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thor’s remarks were ambiguous. Richard wanted to ask again, but he refused to say more. However, the last sentence had already revealed the position that Thor might have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard left, the light and shadow flashed next to him, the old mage who had shot the blue moon, appeared next to Thor, looking at the complex look In the direction of Li’s departure, he sighed: "The breath of the blue moon is almost integrated with him. If you don't pay attention, it is hard to find. It seems that the string moon is really for him, hehe." Torr /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor nodded and said: "It seems that the blue moon has indeed merged with his blood. You should stop making up your mind. The little guy is very murderous. It’s also very difficult to provoke. If you don’t see the turbidity provoke him, you will almost be sacrificed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard sighed again, no She said: "The monthly force of the blue moon is very important to me, but... Hey, okay, anyway, I have nothing to do now in Noland. After two days, I am ready to go, and then I found it last time. Look at the group of half-planets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor frowned: "But now the Legion Fortress needs the legendary strongman to guard, you If you fight long, don’t you think about it again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard smiled and said: “The thing that the league took out is not put. In my eyes, if you want me to sell for you, you have to get something good to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tordo: "But you are also a holy alliance. People, now is a critical moment, how can you let it go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard smiles and says, "Thor, don't take this set of words to me. Since it is a critical moment, why don't you go to the garrison fortress, don't you be a legendary mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor's face is red and angry Road: "But I have been doing research and I am not proficient in the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard said calmly: "But you are also a legendary mage, how about it, too Will not lose to a big magister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Thor was too angry to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to fool people to station in the military fortress, you will get more benefits. The price you pay out will be accompanied by several big magisters." Only, Thor, the legendary Master is not so cheap." The old Master said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor waved his arm and angered: "But you are also a sacred allies, how can you do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master said faintly: "You are not Knowing my blood and age, when I was born, there is no Holy Alliance. The Holy Alliance is just a union, a code name, not a name plus a sacred prefix, it is truly sacred, and the Holy Alliance has not given it. I have anything, why do I want to fight for it, I said, I want to guard the Legion Fortress is not impossible, come up with enough sacrifices, or talk free, like a fool like Long De Stead, but not More, in the end, Thor, for a friend who is almost a hundred years old, I will have said nothing about you just now, just like this, it is estimated that we will not have a chance to meet again in the future."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard directly opened a space portal, stepped in and disappeared, leaving Thor alone angry in the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the floating island and went into the study room to study the information he got from Thor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer domain is actually a collective term for a series of planes. No one can tell how many planes there are in the vast world, where chaos is occupied. Absolutely dominated by the region, the glory of the eternal and the dragon of time can not shine there. In the outer world, there is a messy and upside down world. At the last moment, there can be a powerful race that sweeps several planes. The next moment may suddenly Extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment of the outer domain is worse than the abyss and hell. The apron environment is very stable regardless of the abyss or hell, but the outer world is a world of extreme violent disorder. People know what will happen next time. Every moment, every new plane is born, there are existing plane distortions, and there are planes to annihilate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of Noland, when a foreigner was discovered, there was a group of strong people who went there to explore, and the results were insufficiently prepared. The Outland has become a region where Master Noland has sealed powerful creatures that are hard to kill. Some strong felony convictions will also be exiled there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until hundreds of years later, several legendary mages explored some of the basic rules of the foreign domain, where it became a relatively stable area with Noland, but chaos The power of power dominates, making the law of eternal and timeless dragons inaccessible in the outer world, that is to say, the many graces of the eternal dragon temple can not produce results, and often can be effectively reduced, so the habit For the Nolan strong who enjoys the various bonus effects of the sacrifice, the power will be greatly suppressed, so this area is particularly dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
