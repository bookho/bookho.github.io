How can I even beat these dragons? I still have a lot of treasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the beginning, I tried hard to poke out my head, screaming in dissatisfaction: "You are too bully. For so many years, in addition to constantly biting me, you have taught me anything."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach you how to survive under the dragon's teeth!" The legendary mage took a natural look. In fact, she was very vocal. She snapped her finger and pressed the black dragon at the beginning to grind it. The dragon claws are screaming at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now seeing it. The power of the beginning is not even able to be played by one-tenth of it, and it will be smashed by these dragons. This is naturally Su Helen’s few magical reasons, but Richard saw it clearly. The magic is just the first level of weakness, slowness, and so on. Don’t say that it’s already the beginning of the legendary realm, that is, Richard can also Class junior magic is immune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun glanced at Richard and said, "Hey, Xiao Licha is coming, well, let me go first, Richard, one. I will try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And these dragons." Richard asked with some guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise." Su Hailun asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, he was finally relieved from the dragon claws. He struggled to get up and hurried to the gate of the training ground. When he passed by Richard, he shot I took a look at Richard's shoulder and said with a complex expression: "The kid, it's your turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and went to the center of the experimental field. Then they vacated and confronted the dragons. Only two of these dragons were real dragons. The other six were magic dragons summoned by the magic, three red dragons and three black dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded to Su Hailun and said that he could start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage’s big, bright eyes stared at Richard with a sigh of interest, and the three-handed red dragon tried to rush, and the other three black dragons Then it was copied directly to the side of Richard's side. The other two real dragons were on the top, and they sealed out all the retreats of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard immediately sent a random transmission. This magic is the best way to break the siege. But when he wants to walk into the portal, the portal in front of him suddenly becomes extremely hard. Richard looks like a collision. The wall was directly popped up and it was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The instant portal can also fail. Richard immediately understands that Su Hailun’s hands and feet are obvious. It seems that the legendary mage is not only on the call. Talent, the magic of space magic is also extremely high, interfere with a random portal is just a snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Random transmission is not possible, Richard immediately wants to use his high speed and high agility to flash out from the dragon's siege, but he just moved, the distant Su Helen waved his hand to him, and Richard quickly flashed a few rays of light. The three most common negative spells of weakness, slowness and attack curse fell on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was prepared, the magic light fell on his body, immediately provoked the corresponding magic protection, his magic resistance rose straight, let alone these three or four Magic, that is, the six or seven grades will not take effect. However, the magic of the two sides collided. All the protections of Richard actually flashed and disappeared. The three negative magics were firmly tied to the body, and there was no discount at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suddenly shocked, and then he felt the pain of the beginning, and he was able to use the three primary magics with such power. effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s strength is as deep as the sea. If it is not a personal battle, there is no way to find that she still has so many abilities that have not surfaced, such as this high. To the incredible magic penetration ability, this makes all the magical defenses of the Master in the face of Su Helun, and it becomes similar to paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly felt that he was extremely slow and fragile, and the level of discomfort was just like that of a war prisoner with a faceless knight. What’s worse, Richard saw too early. After the tragic situation, it was foreseen that the magic was limited, so the first time I launched the magical armed forces, I intended to use the vindictiveness to get rid of the magical cage. However, the construction operation was also affected, and the magic transformation of each level became extremely slow. After Su Hailun made a snap, the dragons entered the state of estrus and madness, and their combat power increased greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s speed is even slower than the dragon at the moment, and he suddenly lost his temperament simulation. As well as the wisdom of the talent to bring the full control of the battlefield situation and the analysis of the moment to support the situation, but in a blink of an eye, Richard found that he could not make a mistake, because Su Helun gave him a broken armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This four-level magic directly weakens Richard's body defense to zero, just like an ordinary person. As long as he is picked up by the dragons, he is seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Richard, be careful." Su Hailun shouted happily, not forgetting to wave to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s face suddenly stunned and cold, and took a deep breath, his body sounded like a landslide and tsunami, and the effect of everything in gray was started. In an instant, a silent majesty emerged from Richard, the power of the rule, and the many negative magic that Su Helun added to Richard was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s voice, apparently did not think that Richard actually had this kind of behind, but the next moment the legendary Master’s eyes sparkled, like a little girl. I saw the most beloved toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard’s ruling directed a black dragon to the head, and the black dragon immediately showed a strong dark red light, which instinctively felt bad. Just want to turn around and escape, I saw that Richard flashed through the side like a shadow, then the black dragon saw his side of the dragon wing left the body, flying in the air and hovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dragon felt the pain of the heart after a moment, and it screamed fiercely, suddenly turned into a magical smoke, and it disappeared, its injury is too heavy. The existence of this plane has been maintained, and it is directly restored to the original magical energy, and the soul is removed from the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard seized Su Hailun’s short moment of loss, like a shadow to the other side before summoning the Black Dragon, the left-hand ruling also pointed to it, fate At the moment when the ruling was launched, the right hand moonlight was directly inserted into its back neck. The moonlight fell down, the blood was like a tidal wave, and the black dragon's dragon neck was almost cut in half. This black dragon screamed and disappeared from this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a third call to the Black Dragon, but Richard did not start the fate ruling again. He flashed a few flashes and appeared on the back of the black dragon. Then double-knife down, smashing into the black dragon back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there is no fate ruling blessing, although Richard’s double-knife is inserted in the end, but the ruling has not been able to erupt all things and the effect of life, only The moonlight is effective, and this is the case. The black dragon is also seriously injured on the back. It is a very painful number, and it is desperately trying to smash down Richard and return to bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard pulled out a double knife and calmly flew back. In his original footing, a circle of light blue flames was spreading, covering most of the dragon's back in an instant. This summoned the black dragon and found that the real deadly was not a knife wound. This is a blue fire. Under the faint blue flame, the huge black dragon scales are twisted and melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third call to the black dragon also disappeared, there are two real black dragons and three heads calling the red dragon in the air, and the figure appeared in the air, and his face was pale. In one fell swoop, the three heads summoned the Black Dragon, especially the power of the two fate rulings, which made Richard's endurance power consume more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes flashed the brightness of the tears of Anbis, and said cheerfully: “It’s really good, my little Richard is much stronger than the stupid boy at the beginning.” ", come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Su Hailun’s hands danced rapidly, woven a complex array in the air, and then spit out a few gods. Text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Richard to understand what it means to come again. There are suddenly a number of huge summoning circles in the void around him, at the center of the circle. At the same time, a head dragon is changing from a virtual shadow to an entity. This time, Su Hailun may have played at a super level. He even recalled six black dragons and one red dragon at a time. The red dragon is not an ordinary red dragon. It is actually a red head. Long, seeing such a high number of high-end dragons, Richard can not help but suck a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not intend to entangle with these dragons, the magic swayed, constantly enabled the rule power, and successively resisted or eliminated the Su Hailun number of negative magic attacks. The left-handed long knife pointed to the legendary Master and the fate ruling was launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the dark red light flashing on Su Hailun, Richard screamed and shook his knives together, such as the thunder and lightning to attack Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Richard’s countless hard work, no matter the speed, timing or power of the rules, it’s the peak of Richard’s life, even on the moonlight. Light up a group of bright red blood, it is the power of life to mobilize to the extreme, so across the board, the upper dragon is also seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s blonde suddenly has no wind and it’s automatic, it’s being stunned by the weather of Richard’s, she even feels a sting on her face, that’s The body is instinctively alerting to danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
