			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians and Shamin slaves who were sent from the reorganization have spent another ten days. At the time, Richard needed to teach them how to understand their orders and adapt to the new equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, Sir Shandon arrived as scheduled, delivering the promised supplies, and additionally carrying some additional purchases from Richard. Craftsmen and iron ingots are in desperate need. Two hundred sets of leather inlays, shields, scimitars and boots are what Richard is in urgent need of. Baron Fontaine dared to rob the caravan that went to the territory of Richard, but did not dare to move the team of Sir Shandon. Sir Shandon’s title is not high, but everyone in the kingdom knows that he is one of the Duke’s confidants, and I also come from a huge family that is intertwined. And there is no reason to provoke the country's nobles, and no one can do whatever they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Richard has another 400 Saudi cavalry and 70 barbarian warriors. Although the size of the troops is larger, the combat effectiveness is much worse than in the past. In addition to the lack of training, there is no stepping knight to serve as the captain, and their overall combat effectiveness has dropped by one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took time to go to a turbulent place and fed one hundred and twenty magic crystals to the mother's nest. This allowed it to rise directly to the fifth level and again increased the ability to create combat units in accordance with Richard's wishes. After the five-level promotion is completed, the mother's nest can create six wind teeth or four throwing soldiers every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard rushed back from the edge of the turbulent land, there were forty more throwing soldiers and two elite throwing soldiers behind him. Now Richard’s throwing soldiers are finally over a hundred, and led by three elite throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throwing soldiers do not need to be reorganized, as long as there are elite throwing soldiers, they will naturally become disciplined fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the camp, Richard went straight to the training ground for the sand people and the barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the training ground, Gangde is wrestling with three barbarians, his body is shining with a shiny light, and his muscles are like a squat. It wriggled. From time to time, the barbaric warriors screamed and screamed, and Gangde occasionally snarled. At this moment, a barbarian was thrown out and fell heavily on the ground. This is the collision of pure power and muscles. The onlookers of the barbarian warriors are full of blood and enthusiasm, and they can’t wait to fight for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard arrived, Gangde saw him. Suddenly, he violently screamed, and suddenly he slammed the three barbarian soldiers in one fell swoop and then walked to Richard. Obviously he did not try his best in the fight just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head! Are you coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and looked up Just Gangde. Gangde has just used the power of the earth, and now he is more than two meters tall, and he is particularly tall in the face of Richard, who is less than one meter eight. Now that the blood power is slowly fading, Gangde’s body shape is gradually shrinking and slowly returning to the normal height of two meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not training during this time? What else is there?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the military training and leading troops are handed over to Gangde. In fact, he did not learn how to train and reorganize the army at the death camp. Now it is completely used now. In the past, this was all done by the Cavaliers. When all the Cavaliers were killed, they had to be pressed against Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard's entourage, the water is not willing to say more, Oral only knows the court art and the aristocratic powers, the two ogres don't have to say more, they always drool when they look at the robust barbarian. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there is only sand, but the sand is now busy cultivating two fallen gods and a small priest, and the god of courage Divine power, still trying to study the magic, and to accompany Richard to go to bed. After all, she is a girl, not a bitter force day and night. In fact, her current workload is almost the same as her coolie, and it has become a bitter force to understand the avatar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alright! These guys know how to fight, feed them, and then train them a bit, the quality is very good!" Very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, the price is not bad!" Li said with a smile. The slaves sent by Tiffman are of high quality and are twice the price of ordinary slaves. However, this is Richard’s request. He actually wants to buy a group of fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde suddenly remembered something, so he said, "Yes, head! These days, their training is rather embarrassing, so the food is released." Now that the bacon is almost gone, don't you say that there will be a few big cars of bacon and cheese coming over soon? This is ten days gone, how can you still see the shadow?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The team did not arrive?" Richard was a little surprised, and then his face was dark, remembering that the bacon food was shipped from Shenyan City, and was brought over by Baron Fontaine. Since it has not been overdue for so long, without asking, it must be ‘hijacked’ by the bandit in the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed and said, "This guy is really embarrassing, even a food truck will not give me over!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard’s sunny and beautiful smile, Gangde suddenly had a vague chill in his heart. But this brawny is as if he is not aware of anything, grinning and asking, "What should we do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing, subconsciously moving his hands, although he did not carry a scarf with him, it still seemed to be rubbing the dirty things that did not exist on his hands. He squinted and looked at the direction of Baron's territory, faintly said: "Now, we will prepare a team and rob them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten A cargo wagon left the territory of Richard under the escort of 50 cavalry and drove along a remote road to Deep Rock. Compared with the ordinary caravans, the fifty Shamin cavalry is definitely a very powerful escort force. It is the hundreds of large-scale horses that don't dare to move this caravan easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that the team walked was out of the way, and the truck was obviously very heavy, leaving a deep wheel print along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the team walked, several glides appeared on the road, and the knight was wrapped in a dark cloak without any marks on the hood. Identity and face. They rolled over and looked at the wheel marks on the road. After a while, they turned over and quickly went. From their simple actions, it can be seen that they are all experienced scouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time in a truck in the middle of the team, Richard is closing his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint magical light in the closed compartment, just illuminating the book of Time in front of the flowing sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
