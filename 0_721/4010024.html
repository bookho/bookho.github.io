			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor swallowed a sloppy dragon tail, and the fat neck suddenly swelled in a circle, waiting for the dragon tail that had a weight of ten kilograms to crash. Belly, then everything is back to normal. His eyes narrowed and he said slowly: "This trick is quite unexpected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier carefully figured out the meaning of the emperor, then said: "Ergo The strength of an adult, perhaps ten years later, will be able to break through the blockade and return to Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily! The time flow rate of the face." The emperor said faintly, at this moment, he finally showed a little edge: "In the past, the time flow of the Qiqi plane was twice as slow as that of Nolan, but no one knows the Duke of Mensa. What time did it, if he didn't move his hands and feet, that was incredible. I heard that he has recently gone to the Eternal Dragon Hall a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The courtier immediately put on a face that was eager to ask for help: "As far as the villain is aware, the Duke of Mensa and the Duke of Joseph have at least three sacrifices recently to the master of the Archimonde family. As for the specific god Well, the villain has no way of knowing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice of the Eternal Dragon Temple is top secret, sacrifice and grace The royal family have no right to interfere, the status of the Vatican Lin great High Priest is superior. There will never be anyone who dares to force her to do something. If she does not say offending her, she will wait for the road to sacrifice. It’s just that the aristocrats who have come to the country want to force something to do for her, and they have to consider whether she will be turned over by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn of the Vatican, no one knows her power, because she has no chance to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s great priest is not leaking, but it does not mean that other people in the temple are equally invulnerable. The word of the courtier is that some clerics have been bought in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, so that you can get some news that is not a special core, but is absolutely not available under normal circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor nodded, thoughtfully, and said: "So, both Mensa and Joseph have made a bloodshed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true! But is it really worth it?" The courtier also felt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to interfere with an existing sacrifice, the required sacrifice will rise accordingly. And Richard's sacrifice is the highest level of ritual, that is to say, to intervene in the distorted level of grace, at least double the sacrifice. Therefore, the emperor said that the two families have already made a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Archimonde is very poor, but in the case of sacrifice, there are legendary mage behind them. Legendary Masters can hardly say that they are rich, but it is not a problem to kill one or two thousand-year-olds. Therefore, in the accumulation of wealth, the legendary mage is most sneak attack, but it can not be defeated, at least within the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the feelings of the courtier are also excusable, he is also a real power in the league, but struggle for a lifetime, it is impossible to make up even if it is a minimum A sacrifice of a grade sacrifice. The Eternal Dragon Temple is completely out of reach for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old guys won’t do anything useless. It’s even more impossible to make a joke on the sacrifice. Hey! It’s not good to say that my old man is not Dare to make fun of so many sacrifices! Since they have paid so many sacrifices, it means that the little guy in Richard is indeed worth so much. Well, it seems that I have to pay more attention to this little guy. What's the latest situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This......." The courtier quickly searched for memories, and finally found the fragment of Richard. "I heard that he went to develop a low-level plane, and there was a problem. He was lost in the turbulence of time and space. He has not heard back yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe wants I thought, and asked: "I heard that the sacrifice of Richard last time attracted the will of the eternity and the dragon of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that, But I can't confirm it, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodthirsty Philip nodded and said, "I heard that, most of it is true. That little Li Most of the observations are still under the eyes of the great old dragon, so it is not so easy to happen. Maybe it will appear in front of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier immediately became a big man Excited: "You can rest assured! If Richard returns, the villain must find him in the first place! I heard that Richard is a very talented master of construction, just as the loyal Royal Knights are a bit old. Well, Master Luno’s recent 'physical condition' is not very good. If more than one person 'fixes' the installation of the Royal Knights, the work of Master Luno There will be helpful "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; large package as division Lunuo has served as the Holy Alliance Royal package as teacher for more than three decades. In the last ten years, as the masters of Luno began to attack the production of the fourth-order structure, the structure supplied to the royal family is decreasing year by year, and the materials requested are increasing. This is every royal family, so that every person who asks the builder for a job will have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp nodded and asked the courtier to continue to read the mainland news. The second is naturally the marriage of Mensa and the Schumpeter family. As soon as the news came out, Philip saw the dragon's tail sawtooth axe stopped. He certainly knows what the meaning behind this message is. <br /><br />############ Did not answer, but asked: "To marry Dario is Qi Qi"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is the pearl of the Mensa family. The villain I heard that this was the personal request of the Duke of Dario. Among the twenty-seven single girls in the Mensa family, he only asked for Qi Qi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh! Dario, the old-fashioned ghost, is still the same as before! But he is very smart this time, knowing that Menza can't be too comfortable. Well, since this is the case, we don't have to do anything first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier is puzzled: "Your Majesty, this...will it make Mensa’s power develop too fast?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Qi Qi’s original fiancé was Joseph’s Raymond. Hey, now Joseph’s feeling is definitely not good. So we don’t need to do anything now, wolves and tigers are sleepy. In the same In a valley, if hunters appear, they will unite. If there are no hunters, then there will be only one left between them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The courtier quickly sent the prepared flatter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the court mages, I will wait for him in the living room for a while. I need to know, there are ways to number the plane of a plane. Erase!" After that, Philip stood up. Naturally, a maid came up to change his clothes and wash his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant first responded, then looked at the main meal that didn’t move at the table, and asked in surprise: "Your Majesty! You haven't eaten yet!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
