			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Solomon’s soul was completely annihilated, Auresia’s look relaxed and bowed to Richard’s, saying: “This is all the shadow life for you. Thanks. So in the future, we will never see each other again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also returned to the ceremony and said, "May all the shadows have peace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lucia turned into a shadow, dissipated in the void, and left in his own way. While Richard continued to explore the metal fortress of the Reaper, after removing some important parts that were not damaged, the rest of the wreckage was used by him to refine the essence of the embers with a blue fire and bring them back to the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus slowly starts, before jumping, Richard Looking back, I finally glanced at the place where the Reaper Base had existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end, A Lucia did not know that the reapers were the product of the rules of the world, they appeared in the dark side of the world, because in the ultimate chaos Only the ultimate order will be produced. The reapers are representing the ultimate order of the world, and their duty is to remove all that may threaten the existence of the world itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the world is still there, the reaper will not disappear. Richard ruined the reaper's base, and after a while the world naturally produced a new reaper base. This is the cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no difference in telling Ailsia, the shadow life is in the gap between the world, strictly speaking, they don’t really belong to this. The world is just the projection of the souls that have been harvested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reapers have killed them once, and it is impossible to kill them for the second time. And they can only interfere with the reaper, causing at most a limited amount of damage. This point, in the final battle against Faro, Richard has already discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not tell the truth about Aurelia, at least between the formation of the new Reaper base, she can maintain a relaxed and good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the portal in the void has been formed, and the fascinating fascinated by the seven-color ray jumps into the portal and embarks on the way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After continuous transmission, Faust finally appeared in the dark area of ​​the world. However, this area turned out to be a void, and there is no way to one side of the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of Richard’s search for Su Hailun, the channel that originally connected the dark side of the light disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little calm, Richard knew that the passage could not disappear, but changed the position. But where it actually appears, there is no trace to check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one side of the light, the void of the dark side is also vast, there is no end. In the absence of clues, FS has been flying for hundreds of thousands of years, and it is impossible to find a way to return to one of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, including Richard, all the strong are heavy. Is this always lost in the dark side of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on the world, suddenly dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sky suddenly lit up a little light! In the dark side of the world, this real light is so dazzling that it will not be missed every billion miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little light has expanded rapidly, and in the twinkling of an eye it has become a thorough light beam, shining on the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating, a little more powerful legends feel a bit, and look up. They saw that at the end of the beam of light, there is a very familiar atmosphere, that is the exit to one side of the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, St. Martin’s lazy voice echoed in Richard’s consciousness: “My dear Richard, do you seem to be lost? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A beam of bright sunshine penetrated the thick clouds of the ice floes, shining on the dark blue, like a fairyland on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the high floor-to-ceiling windows and falls on the crystal clear crystal bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal bed, Su Hailun's small pair of eyebrows are tightly locked, and their lips are squatting. Obviously, anger has accumulated to the stage where the line will break out. But the sun was fearlessly climbing up her face, and she couldn’t get away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun breathed more and more quickly, and began to spew a little spark from the small nostrils. But the sun turned a blind eye to the signs of this destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden emergence of hundreds of blue plasma balls in the entire room without warning, and instantly turned the beautiful and pure land into a ruin of destruction and death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the floating plasma sea, Su Helun didn’t know when to sit up, burning his anger and squinting, looking for the culprit who dared to disturb her sleep. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the room she is familiar with, or the familiar bed, even the floor-to-ceiling windows are still her favorite style. Suddenly, Su Hailun felt as if he had returned a few decades ago. At that time, she was carefree, happy every day, but only occasionally worried about her growing treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, a group of Archimonde's young fools were stupid to challenge her. As a result, she had not had time to show her best punches and kicks. She just called the pet dragon out and put the young impulsive guys flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the stupidest guy in the group of young fools, obviously the Cavaliers novel read too much, actually jumped out to say that they have to bear all the consequences! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually signed the loan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula on the basis of the loan is Su Hailun’s thoughts on his head. The incomparably complicated interest-bearing method is actually a debt that cannot be paid off at all. In the impression, the fool seemed to watch it for a long time, and then signed a big name and signed his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment he swiped his signature, Su Hailun knew that this guy didn’t even understand what was written on the loan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody and overbearing guy seems to be called Gotton. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, Su Hailun is thinking, if half of this guy’s blood and courage is turned into knowledge, it’s not going to sign such a piece forever. Clear evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Gordon began to fight for debt. He rises like a comet, creating one after another miraculous work. But Archimonde is too poor. When Gordon bought the equipment, he could not pay the military. Even so, there are still twelve talented fools who are willing to follow Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Archimonde's embarrassment even Su Hailun could not stand, and then supported them. Anyway, her wealth will not be used at all, and giving Gotton can continue to generate income, a very substantial income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Gordon paid some money every time, but borrowed more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Su Hailun is also somewhat confused, and he has made money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, Gotton sent a boy, obviously coming to study in dark blue, actually as part of the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father’s debts are as if they are justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very fresh and delicious boy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is like smoke, There was a flash of light between the moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun finally woke up, but when she saw the plasma ball floating in the house, she suddenly turned white and couldn’t help but scream: "My room..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all the plasma balls are completely out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the dark blue suddenly bursts out of a gap, and the blue plasma is sprayed for dozens of meters! All the wizards who saw this scene could not help but shudder, and the power of blue plasma could destroy everything. However, in the plasma, the legendary mage came out with a crying voice: "My room!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen’s room certainly could not stand the pulp Oh, these blue plasmas used to be with Serra, and the reapers were turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, there was a thunderous cheer in the dark blue, and people knew that Su Hailun woke up. The dark blue with the legendary mage is the real dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the legendary Master at the moment is not responding to the cheers of many mages and apprentices. She is walking around murderously, ready to find something that has been fresh and delicious. The guy is well counted. She remembers that before she slept, she seemed to entrust the dark blue to a little guy. Then the room is destroyed, of course, the little guy is responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s waking news soon spread, and soon Richard rushed. At this moment, Faustian hovered over the ice floes, and Richard could get there as soon as he sent it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Su Hailun suddenly angered, and the small eyebrow brush stood upright, pointing to the ruins behind him and shouting: "How is this going back? Things! I need a..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "interpretation" has not been exported yet, and Su Helun has been held in his arms by Richard. The small and legendary Master suddenly felt dizzy, and consciousness suddenly became blank. For a moment, she actually forgot why she said that she had hugged her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Su Hailun and Richard left their living quarters and began to inspect the entire dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current deep blue is not only a mage tower, but also a city. Dozens of small towns are dotted around the dark blue, and there are workshop industries such as magic material processing. The Master who has studied in Dark Blue has reached thousands of people, ten times as much as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called learning, in Su Hailun's understanding, is equivalent to working for her in disguise. Therefore, the legendary mage with the dragon character is quite satisfied with the status quo, but her little face is still on the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After patrolling the dark blue, Richard took her to the half-face and returned the half-face filled with wealth to her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Su Hailun did was to go straight to his treasure room, and then there was a scream in the void: "Where is my treasure?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty treasure room is indeed looking miserable and deserted, only the center has a crystal table with a bucket of embers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out the essence of the embers, with an uncontrollable pride, saying, "That is your treasure."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of this barrel is much more than the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put all the embers from the smelting Reaper Fortress in this vat. Now in the wealth of Su Hailun, the essence of Yu Yu can be packed in barrels. This is even more than an upstart saying that my family has a few artifacts. However, there are such people around Richard, no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
