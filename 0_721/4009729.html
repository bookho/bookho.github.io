			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the residential area, Richard and Shan chat with Haizheng More and more speculative. The girl is dancing and talking about her own glory in the cold hunting of the cold in the past few years, but Richard has heard something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, mountain and sea, what you mean just now, are you a warrior?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! The elders have said that I will be able to inherit all the saints of the saints in the future!" The girl said of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a bit confusing, trying to discretion the wording so as not to accidentally hurt the girl’s self-respect: "Can you learn magic? Oh, I mean, At the same time, learning the magic and the warfare techniques of your tribes, will there be conflicts, but slow down the entry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why learn magic? This kind of complexity And the troublesome thing, it’s useless to learn! Oh, sorry, Richard, I’m not talking about you.” The mountain and the sea apologetically stretched out his tongue to Richard, then looked at Richard’s lips and revealed Pouting expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately subconsciously leaned back to the body, and the girl knew that she was showing her feet again, so she immediately sat down in danger and stretched a small face, a serious saying : "Magic is really useless to me. You can slap a piece of magic below level 5. I can hardly lock the six levels of magic. I am still small, wait a little longer. The level of magic that can be immune and evaded will be higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the power of the mountains and the sea is already very strong, Richard did not expect to be strong enough. At this point, it seems that the tribal force of the Calando continent is no lower than Noland. But this is still expected, and Richard is strangely another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mountain and sea, since you are not planning to learn magic, why should you be a teacher's student?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea play with a hanging scorpion with fingers, and of course: "Because His Highness Su Hailun is a legendary mage. I just want to find a legendary teacher, and I don't intend to learn from her." Plus her, then I have three legendary teachers, plus mom and grandmother. The elders said that this is called 'background', and you are very valued by the mainland of Noland. As for the dark blue, it is worthwhile to spend a little money, even if it is I didn’t learn it, but I also had a 'background'. In the words of your Noland, this is called...called... steel rock!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a hill-like barbarian warrior trotting all the way, leaning over, hard to get to the girl's ear, but also trying to lower the voice, said: "called gold-plated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Gold-plated? So strange words, why should gold be plated? Is gold not everywhere? If you want to describe it, I Was coated with a layer of the ninth produced the emerald abyss magic iron will be more image a bit. "Mountains and sea solemnly discussing rock and steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian warrior apparently did not think deeply about this problem, so he stunned his hand and tried to find a reasonable explanation for the word: "Maybe in Nolan On the mainland of Germany, gold is already a valuable thing. You see, everything here is marked with gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea suddenly realized: "No wonder the elders It is said that in the mainland of Noland, the use of spider crystals and gold coins represents two different realms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is so!" Steel rock is very young Wisdom is admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard felt that something was wrong, but he couldn’t say it. If Black Gold is here, it is inevitable to attack the ignorance of the barbarian with irrefutable arguments. The minimum circulation unit of the currency and the block trade are completely different concepts, and it is impossible for the spider crystal to replace the gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it is Black Gold itself, you have to admit that the use of spider crystals and the use of gold coins does represent different realms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the time of the legendary Master’s appointment is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun has always been very punctual, but it is a request for others. She herself has some habits of dragons, that is, occasionally not punctual, such as being late for a few days, and so on, because it is more than an hour to delay the appointment time, it is more. In this regard, all the big magisters are very understanding, because the legendary mage can not waste time, even if sleeping, is also a good time to increase the magic. The true foundation of the dark blue is rooted in the magical power of Su Helun. When you come to Deep Blue to visit the legendary Master, you will meet people with special circumstances. Generally, you don't mind spending an hour or two for His Highness Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, Richard’s luck with the mountains and the sea is also good or bad. Fortunately, the legendary mage’s nap has woke up, and the legendary mage is not naturally awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage is scheduled to see the mountain and the sea, is the same place, it is a small meeting room, less than two hundred square meters, in Her private area is indeed one of the smallest living rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage at the moment is lying on the couch, a small foot on the arm of the couch, and the left hand extends out of the couch. The fingers occasionally swayed a few times, and the fruit in the golden pot on the ground flew by itself, fell into the mouth of the legendary mage, and disappeared completely. Her sleeping position is very unsightly, but the white arms and calves are enough to create a strong visual impact, letting people completely ignore the actions that are completely incompatible with elegance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes are half-open, but the bright pupils have no focus. Anyone who knows her knows that this is a sign that she has not yet woken up. This time is also the most dangerous time for the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a resounding melody in the living room, which originally contained the sound of sober and refreshing magic but has no effect on the legendary mage. Seeing the legendary Master's eyelids gradually sag, and to continue to start sleep at the end of the night, her curly long hair hanging from her forehead suddenly stood up, as if she had her own spirituality, she was vigilantly explored. Its tremors became more and more powerful, and suddenly leaped up, the legendary Master suddenly burst into excitement and called and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are fully open, the flames of anger are shining in the depths of her eyes, and two colorful air streams are ejected from the straight, high-pitched nose. That is the eddy current of the element that cannot be turned away. For a time, the elements in the space seemed to be awakened, all cheering, jumping to the legendary mage, marking a mysterious track around her, ready to listen to the assignment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage looks like a power, and starts to look for enemies, but finds that there will be no one in the living room, except for snacks and fruits, there is no object to be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun looked at the ringing magic clock, then looked at the long hair that slowly fell on the top of his head, suddenly smiled and knocked on the couch. Handrails. With her little movements, more than a dozen magic clocks that were hidden everywhere sounded at the same time. This is a signal to urgently call the great magisters to discuss matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, seventeen great magisters sneaked in, while a team of black elf girls moved in seventeen seats for each big magister Put a seat. Su Hailun reloaded the nails, and the black elf waitress outside the hall had already received an order, so he brought the waiting guests into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
