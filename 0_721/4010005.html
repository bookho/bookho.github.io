He summoned several sandmen's cavalry, took the Oral and the twilight, and left the blue water oasis and rushed to the red Cossack slave camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten kilometers from the slave camp, Richard stopped and, according to information obtained from several old friends, this is the slave camp sentry The farthest distance from the patrol. Then patiently wait until the dark, only to release the enhanced elite bat. The elite bat hovered over the slave camp, and with its perception, Richard had a clear understanding of the deployment of the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge camp where nearly 8,000 slaves are held and the number of guards reaches 500. And there is a team of horse stables not far from the camp. From the interaction of the two camp personnel and the route of the patrol teams of both sides, it should be armed by the red Cossacks, with nearly three hundred cavalry. It seems that after being robbed of a second-level caravan by Richard, the red Cossack temporarily added the guards of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconnaissance of the slave camp, Richard quietly left, returned to the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard knocked on the door of Amman, it was already late at night. Old man Amman still lives in the grocery store and runs the small shop that is inconspicuous. The outsiders simply cannot see that this simple old man is actually one of the people who can influence the situation in the entire oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the side door and see that it is Richard, Amman has some accidents. But he did not say anything, but let Richard into the store, a pot of tea and a snack on the back. After the two men sat down, Amman poured two cups of black tea, and then he looked at Richard safely and waited for him to explain his intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate and said bluntly: "I will have a group of slaves soon, and I need to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How much? Race?" Amman asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of eight thousand. The sand people and the dwarves are close to four thousand, and there are hundreds of wild elves, dark elves, and barbarians, but among the elves and barbarians. Doesn't include strong males."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman looked at Richard with a meaningful look and said, "You are too anxious."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "If you are not sure, you will be anxious. And if we can cooperate with each other, then my grasp is more than 80%. Do you have to wait ten times to get things done?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"80%? You are really confident." Amman smiled and said: "But young people are confident that it is a good thing, I will be ... 60% Grab it. Do you need the support of Luofu adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Yes. Red Gossac has two Sanctuary strongmen, although they I don't want to come to the land of blood, but even if I only come one, it is difficult for me to deal with it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amman sipped a lipstick Xu Xu said: "The confrontation between the Sanctuary strong is not a trivial matter. Are you prepared for enough price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Cossack in the Blue Water Oasis Benefits, we are each half. This price should be enough," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not small." Amman sighed and said slowly: "But the battle of the Sanctuary is not measured by gold coins. Negative, sometimes more important than gold coins. So Luofu adults are likely to consider carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
