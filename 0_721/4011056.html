			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will." Richard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will meet with the tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niya flies into the sky and then throws Silver Moon Elf's camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the movement, five hundred night elf warriors went to the Silver Moon Elf, and the elite warrior headed said to Niya: "His Royal Highness, we are inspected by Richard. The command of His Royal Highness will be stationed, and we will leave after five years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the port direction sounded a long horn, and the fleet of Richard slowly departed. Drive to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the seven distant ships, Niya’s eyes are complicated, she knows that Richard left these night elves to protect the Silver Moon Elves. The anti-elf empire revenge, and these night elves are there, no matter how many, they represent the face of Richard, and the defeated elf Wang Ting, most of them dare not touch it again to start the silver moon elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five years, the Golden World Tree should have grown into a small tree, and it has begun to take off. Under the protection of the Golden World Tree, the Silver Moon Wizard will have at least The power of self-protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bridge of the blue moon, Richard looked back and looked at the big island that was far away, and put a burden on his heart, he finally Completed the promise of confrontation and completed the promise that Ilani never said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Moon Elf’s Everlasting Forest was destroyed by the hands of Gordon, and now Richard has rebuilt a new Yongye Forest on this large island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinyue Elf has rebuilt the basic conditions of Wang Ting, and then it is necessary to look at himself. Richard cannot protect them forever, because this only Will eventually ruin the Silver Moon Elf, as a former Elf King, Silver Moon Elf will not lack talent and strength, and will not lack the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the night elves left behind, it is actually a kind of deterrent, because after Richard returns, he will soon embark on the journey of the abyss, and this Once, he himself did not know if he could return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet is gradually speeding up, and the speed of returning is faster than when going to the Cangqing continent. The entire fleet has a cruising speed of more than 150 kilometers, but in magic. The power of the ship is very stable, just like flying against the surface of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic lab set up by the flagship, Richard barely felt that the giant ship was moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voyage is long, and Richard is not idle. He re-examines his own structure one by one, except for the end of life, all other structures are one by one. Fine-tuned or reworked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the continent of Noland appeared in the field of vision, Richard finally completed the re-engineering of all the structures, and now everything becomes gray and finally becomes the fifth order. The suit, which is in addition to the Medalun battle version, the entire Nolander's first set of true fifth-order suits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Noland, Richard is still facing heavy work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expedition abyss, he can't go alone, although it is impossible to recruit millions of troops into the abyss like Charles the Great, but at least bring a few The ancestral warriors of the Legion, otherwise, the endless demons in the abyss may kill Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Akmon's war machine began to roar again, making Nolan's giants frightened, but some people don't understand, a lot of The night elves are re-entering the Green Forest, and the soldiers will be re-modulated in the nest of the mother's nest to greatly increase their resistance to the abyss environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Faustian, Richard saw that his desk was full of official documents, and the request for a call was backlogged, but this time Instead of dealing with these daily affairs on his own, Richard did not classify and assign tasks to different followers and family members. He was a rare and easy one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the study room and seeing the empty desk, Richard is somewhat uncomfortable. He opens the magic map and starts a switch to the private plane. After the map, after a quick review, Richard knew that the territory was normal and there was no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and called Alice into the study, then pushed three golden crystals to her and said, "This is the three resource planes." The coordinates, you go to build the plane transfer door, and then arrange some troops to enter the occupation, as fast as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is slightly surprised, she This type of plane coordinates has never been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard said: "These are the first-level resource planes of the Elven Empire. So be careful. Although the high elves are hurting this time, it is difficult to ensure that they will not secretly do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are the resource planes of the Elf Empire." Even Ai Li, who has always been calm, always couldn’t help but exclaim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resource plane of the Elven Empire was very famous, it has been completely conquered, and a perfect mining and production system has been established. Being domesticated into the hard work of collecting resources, it is no exaggeration to say that no matter who gets the ownership of the resource plane, there is almost nothing to do except to wait for the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income of these resource planes is basically more than 100 million gold per year. In contrast, Richard’s income in Faro is not even in this half. In the future, there is really a potential for achieving the standard of resource level, which is the high energy level of the Golden Valley and the Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that Ellie will be exclaimed, the income of 300 million gold coins is huge, even if Archimonde has a point exchange system, it cannot ignore such a huge amount. Gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this income, Archimonde can support a million-dollar regular army, or 300,000 elite troops, to Richard At present, the definition of an average of 12 levels of elite troops, 300,000 elite troops are enough to defeat an empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Richard is paying more attention to is the dozen rare resources produced in these three planes, three of which are the first to be acquired by Archimonde. Their existence can suddenly increase the options of armament by more than a dozen items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ellie took the lead, Richard looked through the information for a while and frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the star-studded figures, Richard is keenly aware of the current bottleneck, that is, the transport capacity and transportation cost of the plane channel, three resources The addition of the plane has further exacerbated this tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three major resource planes are mostly indispensable for the fine iron ore, the blade iron used for bow and arrow, but the huge amount of resources. Even if most of the initial processing is done inside the plane, the required transportation volume is in the order of thousands of tons. Stars are the best way to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the number of special units in the nest is extremely precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard hesitated, whether to squeeze out a special unit and build a new star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very difficult decision, and Richard temporarily put it down, bringing a bunch of resources from the Elf Empire and the leaves of the Golden World Tree. I came to Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nyris." After leaving the portal, Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard who greeted Richard said: "His Nairsi is not at the base, she is now sleeping in the golden world tree."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was surprised and nodded, then vacated, and flew to the mother's nest with several sacred guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the green forest of the forest, there are two special areas, one is deep purple, the radius is hundreds of kilometers, covering tens of thousands The area of ​​square kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a bright and vibrant forest with an area of ​​tens of thousands of square kilometers in the middle of this forest with a different indigenous style. It is a golden world tree that has grown to nearly a kilometer high. From the huge canopy whose square is also up to a kilometer, there is actually sunshine that does not know where it comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright sunshine falls from the branches and leaves of the world tree and sprinkles in all directions, which makes the golden world tree and the surrounding area more than ten kilometers away. In a sunny, vibrant world, the forest here is lively, agile, and happy, and is completely different from the rest of the forest, which is almost crazy and twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the real world." When Richard passed the golden world tree, his heart could not help but feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he just thought that Green Forest’s Lin Hai was awkward, but now with the world formed by the Golden World tree, it is a clear reflection of the Green Forest Sea. The kind of repressive, gloomy, moist vitality is so uncomfortable. The creatures that grow up in this environment are more or less contaminated with fierce distortions. The Green Sen guardian is the representative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a warm and lively will encases Richard, this is the will of the golden world tree, although it is huge, but on the soul level, if It is said that the three tetrahedrons that Licha has appeared are a mountain, so the golden world tree is a small sapling that has just grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
