If equipped with a war horse, this group of people can form a most elite knight! The same level of the Knights with the Eagles Knight! In terms of quantity, it has even surpassed the core knight of the Eagles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the sophisticated equipment of these fighters, no one doubts that these soldiers can easily defeat several times the enemy already. What's more, Richard also has a group of wizards and gods who are already famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these warriors like wolves, all the nobles have lost their voices. The representatives of the aristocrats who are present now are different from those of the previous month. Many of them have been replaced by generals who know how to command the soldiers. It is natural to see the extraordinaryness of these soldiers. I believe that no one will be willing to face such an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the nobility generals made Richard very satisfied. Boasting force is a direct and effective shock, which will pave the way for the next step of the restructuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the size of the aristocracy, the command of the private army has always been extremely important, and the private army of each aristocracy is not uniform, and a large number of private troops need to emphasize the military discipline. Finally, Richard also trained them to master the basic formation and learn various military orders. Otherwise, Richard is no longer able to command a group of troops who do not listen to orders to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Richard’s prediction, it will take at least another ten days for the reorganization. He already has a complete concept, and in addition to all aristocratic private army re-edited by arms, the troops will be divided into three levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core is Richard’s own army, which is the main force used by Richard to defeat the enemy. Secondly, it was the vassal of the Viscounts of Heim and the Duke of the Wolf. This group of troops, like the army of the Greenson plane, played an important role in training the formation. In the end, it was the private army of other nobles. Richard estimated that it would take at least a month or two for them to take shape. He doesn't have that much time, so the use of this part of the army is to fill the gap in battle, or to use it as a cannon fodder. It’s just that under the supervision of Richard, the cannon fodder is not so easy to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the military review ceremony, Richard summoned all the aristocratic commanders and announced the reorganization plan. Sure enough, as soon as Richard had expected, several generals had blown up the pot. Directly squatting at Richard, this is a plot. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the princes of the Count of Heim and the Duke of the Wolf immediately expressed their willingness to obey all the orders of Richard, and they took the lead and immediately suppressed most of the opposition. In the end, only one aristocratic general who came with only two hundred private troops refused to accept the adaptation, but asked to withdraw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence that has been silent is laughing at this moment, touching the stiff short hair on the lips and saying, "Is this time, I want to quit?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general immediately jumped out of the chair, pulled out the sword, and shouted: "What do you want? I am the jazz of the Sequoia Kingdom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general did not finish a sentence, Richard has flashed in front of him, directly punched his face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punch is lightning fast, and it is surprising. The general did not think that Richard would suddenly start. He took the sword in his hand, but he was just bluffing and doing gestures. He didn't want to be really a master of the coach in the public, so his attention was placed on the followers and guards of Richard in the conference room. Richard is a magician. Who can think of a magician who will punch a punch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th-level general should fall down and struggle. After two struggles, the personnel will not be saved. Obviously, Richard’s punch is very heavy, and he actually stunned the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles were in awe, they didn’t see the hand-to-hand battle between Richard and Io. In Faro, both the Master and the Priest are known for their physical weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he is not surprised by this result, and if he is not worried about the face of his family, he still wants to jump to the general and step on his feet. To fully express the loyalty to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn Viscount’s heart changes are wonderful, changed from hatred, fear, and fear, and finally become loyal and even dependent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi’s eyebrows leaning against the corner suddenly wrinkled slightly. Among the people in the room, only he saw that Richard used the sacred fighting technique, but he did not The thought is that in a short period of time, Richard’s sacred fighting techniques have actually improved. If this continues, it will be a little troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his position and sat down safely, saying to Gangde: "Go and take over the guy's troops."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde came out and didn’t ask what would happen if he encountered resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the venue for a week, and everyone slowly calmed down and eventually fell silent. He stood up, put his hands on the table, and leaned forward slightly. He said, "You! I know that many of you are dissatisfied with the adaptation of the troops. But you want to rely on this person to get through the blood, not It will not work at all. If we expand the size of the army, our supply will not be able to keep up. After ten days of the official start of the line plan, I will give you a chance to quit. At that time, who would not do it, then You can leave with your own troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard once again stressed: "Remember, after ten days of war, it will be your only and last Opportunity." But when Richard said this, many nobles found his tone a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the combat conference, the aristocratic generals have come out of the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them saw the intention of Richard’s ten-day agreement, and that was to show them hope. Until then, the generals remembered a series of brilliant achievements, and several even began to debate enthusiastically, but after a while, the face of Viscount Heim became iron. The forgotten generals have forgotten for a time, and most of the records that Richard has known for the world are built on the viscount of Him and the family behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Viscount couldn’t bear it, and coughed heavily, the generals suddenly realized and stopped talking. It didn't take long before someone couldn't help but discuss how far Richard could advance in ten days. There are 30 kilometers, and 50 kilometers. There is a must-have place for each of these two distances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him also forgot the unhappiness and participated in the discussion. He insisted that Richard could reach 80 kilometers. The generals are very aware of the personality that the Count of Heim must have reported. Although they dare not argue too much, they obviously look different. Many people think that Him is desperately bragging about the purpose of Richard to hide his incompetence. After all, it was too bad for Him to lose in Richard. Most of the nobles in the Sequoia Kingdom did not know that the viscount of the mid-late period of the dispute was not on the scene. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most of the generals have also forgotten their private army, and the quality equipment is far less than the fines of the Viscounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard had his own ideas but did not say anything to anyone. He is busy organizing the army during the day, speeding up meditation at night, and replenishing all the stellar stars that can be motivated. Since the discovery of the Elven Star Blood can speed up the meditation, it is natural to strengthen it in the first place. This kind of blood circulation ability, the earlier the strengthening effect is greater. As time goes by, the change of the main star of the magic star becomes more and more obvious, the second branch has grown, and the tip of the branch is a little more green, and it is possible to sprout the second leaf at any time. I don't know what kind of ability the magic star will give to Richard when the second leaf grows out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Russia and Russia, Richard has decided to put him aside for the time being. The so-called level dispute, in the face of a series of major events, is almost insignificant that Richard has more important things to do. If a marshal is desperate to go to the other side's creeps, it will be stupid, or it will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to meditation, Richard also produced a structure for both Sandro and Liusha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer is the second-order magic, which can increase the magic power of the Undead Master by nearly 30%, which means that Sandro's undead army has also increased by 30%. The construction of the flowing sand consumes a lot of time and energy from Richard, and it is rare to have two mistakes before it is finally completed. The second-order assembly spell speedup, although a standard version of the assembly, is more difficult than some third-order configurations. But the spell speeds up by 10%, which is extremely important for the flow of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard also made a permanent addition of 20% strength as a practice, handed it to Him, counted as the first for him. Remuneration, so that he can temporarily cross the family. Hem, who got the structure, was surprised and happy, and immediately sent his confidant back to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten days later, Richard has re-edited the army and established the military discipline by killing more than a dozen private soldiers who made trouble. On the eleventh day, nearly 10,000 troops set off from the Blue Water Oasis, and the Long Line Plan officially began! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stepping out of the blue water oasis, even Richard himself did not foresee, and then there will be a magnificent battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a logistics force consisting of more than 10,000 slaves. Moreover, more than ten large and small chambers of commerce, headed by Jinhui Battle Flag, can also receive certain supplies at the base of the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the expedition, Richard did not ride the horse, but chose to ride. This time, the sand was in the same car as Richard. She held her hands with her hands and looked at the gazing at the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard suddenly said to himself: "This is not the case! You must use the gods and mages together to get the most effect."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard’s eyebrows were tight, and he couldn’t help but rub his forehead with his hand and muttered, “But the Masters will forget, those shrines will never listen. I commanded, what should I do... Is it so laissez-faire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand suddenly saw a bit of painful color in the eyebrows of Li, this is already today The third time since. The Dark Blue Master has always been as strong as a cow. How can Richard look so exhausted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand can't help but say: "Lee, what's wrong with you? If you are tired, take a break, the magical energy can't be used more. So I don't have it now. Ways to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what happened, I have a terrible headache these days!" During the speech, there was another painful attack, let Li I couldn't help but hug my head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
