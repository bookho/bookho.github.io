He suddenly noticed that he immediately hid in the abandoned house next to him in the white night, converging the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly blew the wind, the screams of screams, and the sound of roaring, in the sky, a team of Dax Sodas strong The people were flying at full speed and flew to the camp outside the city. Obviously, their offense was once again repelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha screams that if he is late, he will probably hit the retreating Dakso Das, and he leans against the wall. Holding her white night, she buried her face in her chest, and made a simple camouflage magic with the only magic, so that her breath was not exposed, and then quietly waited for the Dax Sodas to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there were a few loud and roaring roars in the distance. It’s so powerful that only legendary powers can do it. Richard understands that they must be It was so angry when I discovered the misery of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of strong players staying in the camp is quite a lot, but all of them are injured and the fighting power is greatly reduced. These strong players are all affected by the previous battles. After the injury, I was unable to fight a hard fight, and I stayed in the camp to help the treatment with the nutrient solution secreted by the servant. I didn’t expect it to be entered by the White Night and Licha, almost all the wounded were wiped out, so lost. Presumably, there has never been a whole process of besieging the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Richard’s lips finally floated on a long-lost smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Dakso Das’s attacks on the undefeating capital of the day have been quite restrained, they will attack under the cover of a large number of black magicians. Enter the city and look for the Noland Power Fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black magician can create thick fog, temporarily block and weaken the damage caused by long-lasting brilliance, so that the powerful can play close to all combat power, and when The magic of the Dark Sorcerer will be exhausted, and the Dakosodas will retreat and take as much as possible of the wounded who can be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rarely choose to fight hard with a long-lasting glory. After all, in the special place of the absolute battlefield, the symbolic meaning of the military fortress is greater than the military significance. The essence of the domain battlefield is to let the other party lose blood and kill the other sanctuary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakosodas’ strategy is to kill as many human powers as possible in a relatively favorable environment. If the strong are killed, then the day will not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side of the siege, Dakso Das people can enter the day and night, so whether they come or not, the long-lasting glory must remain burning In this way, the day will not last long, although it seems that as long as it is not attacked, the sacrifices of the day will not be lost, the army fortress will be easy to change, but the Dax Sodas also consume Unable, they can't stay in the sun for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norland’s strongmen reacted and obtained accurate information, and the Dax Sodas were on the local battlefield in the sun. The absolute advantage will be broken. Now that the other two empire are stationed in the military fortress, the number of strong people is increasing, and the frequency of attacks is getting higher and higher. The blockade of the two regiment fortresses by the Dax Sodas is It is a matter of time to withstand more and more pressure and the blockade line is broken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case that both parties can't afford it, it is natural to strike a balance between the offensive and defensive rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief and determined that he was temporarily safe. He returned to his place of residence all the way. It is still miraculously still calm, and when he leaves There is no increase or decrease of one brick and one watt. It seems that this time the war, the Dax Sodas people really deliberately avoided this black field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two broken doors of the house where Lawrence lived were tightly closed, and Richard knocked for a long time and no one answered, but the old man’s breath was clearly in the room, and There were no other abnormalities. Finally, he finally patiently warned that he opened the door with one foot, only to find that the old man was shrunk in the bed, wrapped in his head with a quilt, and shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s eyes are shining, and the state of the old man is clear at a glance. He knows that he has no injuries at all, and he does not know whether the laugh or the gas is called. Road: "Old man, hurry up, save people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence heard the voice of Richard, and then dared to head out and said: "And It is white night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not who she is." Richard did not say goodbye, he is now the madness of the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clear that you can slowly grind it with the legend. She has to die suddenly at the last moment, even if the legend is hurt more than the white night, and How about it, the Dakso Das people are famous for their vitality. This is especially true for the strong ones who are obviously rare monsters. White nights don’t have this resilience. She only relies on Lawrence’s medical skills to be fast. Resume, then go out and fight half to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard now knows a little bit about the mood of the old man who occasionally violently walks away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence really spit out a series of swearing, and at the same time quickly prepared a treatment for the device, commanding Richard to put the white night flat, directly pour a few buckets of water On her body, the blood was washed clean, and it began to examine the wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing how Lawrence concentrated, God couldn’t help but say: "She's fine, let her handle it first, then come see my injury." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and stay, your resilience is no worse than that of Dakosodas, like the first superintendent of the bear, no, you It’s just a bear’s first overseer. In addition, you don’t mean to take my healing medicine a little bit, but you can’t cure yourself. You can run back in the white night, there’s nothing big, don’t hurt there.” Lawrence While flying down the knife, the side of the ball was like a cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was helpless, had to take a set of tools, took off his clothes, washed the blood marks, began to deal with the wound, he relaxed, chest ribs immediately Opened a horrible wound. The wound was half a meter long. It cut across the chest and abdomen of Richard. Even the internal organs were hurt. Richard took a deep breath and immediately spurted a bloody water in the wound. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence said next to him: "Respiratory slows, are you looking for death, kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard immediately stabilized his emotions, slowly breathing, and while checking the injury, he slowly thought about the treatment plan. After repeated thinking, he began to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daksodas attacks often have chaotic and dark attributes, which are no different from Nomadic humans. One step is often to remove the carrion that has been contaminated with the most chaotic power, and in this process, extract as much negative force as possible, and then rely on the strong to force dozens of times more vitality than ordinary people. restore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still cutting his organs for the first time, it is a kind of taste that can’t be expressed in words at all, even if he will be firm again, the first time There is always some uneasiness in doing this kind of thing. Simply, his hands are still stable, and stability seems to have become an instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a knife and a knife went down, Richard gradually settled down and began to deal with the injury in a meticulous and serious manner. The stability of his hands is exceptional, just like cutting someone else. body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the decayed part is removed, the black smoke visible to the naked eye is also largely removed, and the remaining fresh body begins to creep quickly, and then the granulation begins to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye, filling the cut off portion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the process with his own eyes, and his heart was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet, only the occasional knife collision sound, and the sharp edge of the blade across a large area of ​​skin or organs, Richard finally finished his own The wound, I took a piece of the skin that Lawrence had specially treated, and put it on the wound to seal it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kid, look, this is not doing very well, bring the first aid kit to the body, and maybe one day will save your life. Don't rely on the gods. You can always find them around you, and the gods say that it is the shackles and megaphones of God. Maybe you will offend God one day, you will find that no official is willing to treat you. Even if they are willing to put on the magic of you," Lawrence said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was somewhat dissatisfied. His first reaction thought of sand drifting, and the relationship between sand and sand was very close and general. I can't help but say, "Then I can still find the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that you will not be guilty of the Eternal and Time Dragon? The old dragon is really high, but it is not God," Lawrence said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a slogan for a moment, I can’t think of anything to refute, and he has so many sacrifices that he has won the title of a traveler, how can he be sinned? In the Eternal and Time Dragon, and the amount of grace he has received, it is enough to pay for the sand, as long as he can drive the magic pen, sacrifices and gold coins are endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has long been taught the stubbornness of Lawrence, and the old man seems to have a strong prejudice against the dragon of eternal and time, just to see that he has a box of top sacrifices. However, the product does not want to go to the sacrifice to know, although the life of the rapids of the gods has a low probability, but after all, it is not without, St. Lawrence is now even unwilling to try his luck, so Richard wisely chose not to go Refutation, otherwise it is an endless debate. Although his wounds have been handled well, the battle has been overdrawn by too much physical strength, and now fatigue has begun to entangle him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Lawrence has stabilized the white night's injury, covered her body with a white cloth, I don't know if it was used, or it was too white night. Fatigue, her breathing was smooth and subtle, and she fell into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
