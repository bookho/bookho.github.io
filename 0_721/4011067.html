			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of this size is bound to be powerful. Richard actually used the core of the 36 devil lords as the starting energy, and he barely started the squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the giant 100-meter giant plane portal in the statute appeared, almost all followers were stunned. When the image of Faustian appeared in the portal, everyone was even more sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Abyss abyss cannot be transmitted, or the transmission is extremely difficult. There is only a natural transit route to the Abyss abyss from the abyss and hell. In the era of the Elven Empire, in order to enter and exit the Abyss, the super-artifact of the door of July was used! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Richard actually arranged a seat-side portal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the rules of action are striking, the cost of starting is extremely high, and the core of each small lord is equivalent to a top sacrifice, but even then Its power is simply not comparable to the super artifacts like the July Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high elves of the Great Empire only entered and exited the Abyss abyss, and the door of July was completely destroyed, and no longer entered the bottom of the world. ability. Now, with only the energy of thirty-six top sacrifices, Richard has opened the passage to Noland. From this point of view, at least in terms of space rules, Richard has far surpassed the gods of the higher elves of the Great Empire era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers who followed Richard all the way were no different, but people like Iron Shield and Goshawk could not conceal their shock. In the Reaper War, they can also feel the boundaries of Richard's strength. Richard was strong at the time, but it was not strong enough to be unmatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, a plane that connects the abyss of Noland and Abis has allowed them to see the power of Richard from the side. Unconsciously, Richard has been so powerful to this point? Even the elf of the Great Age of Empires can no longer stand shoulder to shoulder with him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu looked at the scene of Noland in the portal and said, "Hey! Are we going back? Not to say Get through the world channel, and see what dark world is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go back, I can do it alone," said Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this going!?" The first ogres of the ogre will not do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "You have reached the limit and can't go any further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A little starlight flew out of Richard's hand, illuminating an area around him. In the light of the stars, all followers saw that there was a thick black gas in their body. If you look at the black gas, you can tell that there are countless small runes floating in the air. Several strong men immediately sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said calmly: "This is the venom of the devil's lords. If you accumulate, you will fall, and even the soul will be annihilated. So It’s already your limit here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the space bracelet on his wrist and gave it to the followers, saying: “This There are some members of the big lords, and there are things that go beyond the top sacrifices. After you go back, go directly to the Dragon Temple to sacrifice, with the power of the eternal and time dragon, you should be able to resolve the toxicity of your body. It takes a lot of energy to maintain the portal. You can go back now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers know that it will not play any more role, so Enter the portal one by one, and at the same time try to take away the complete bones of a devil's big lord. If Richard did not get a huge ring from the high elves of the Cangqing continent, there would be no way to take away such a large skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no face but no go, she is the only one of them who has not eaten the core of the small lord. For the superb combat skills and the lack of face artifacts, even in the Abyss abyss, she will not be injured at all. But from beginning to end, she has not participated in the battle that she can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face shrug, said: "I certainly don't go Here, I can adapt more than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deep into the face and was more curious about her experience. However, he also knows that he is asking questions and asking questions. No face will definitely give him an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last follower entered the portal, the huge portal was distorted for a while and disappeared. The core of the small lord embedded in the squad has lost its luster and turned into a gray stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said "go away" to the faceless, and he should go to the depths of the battlefield first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield of the eternal bloody battle seems to be endless, and Richard and the faceless walked all the way, and three months passed without knowing it. The deeper the battle, the fiercer the fierce battle, and the higher the level of demons and demons. Later, almost every day, I met one or two big lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of the bloody battlefield are extremely powerful and strange. It seems that the more powerful Richard, the more and stronger the devil lords appearing in front of him. The entire Abyss abyss seems to be able to evaluate the strength of every demonic and devil on the battlefield, and then send roughly equal opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before embarking on the battlefield of eternal bloody battles, Richard completely wondered that there would be so many big lords. But think about the abyss and hell are endless vast worlds, do not know how many levels they have, so it is not surprising that so many big lords appear in the abyss of Abis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal bloody battle is a no return, once the devil and the devil enter here, they can no longer go back. They can only kill each other, and with the help of each other's flesh and blood, this process never stops. This is the fate of all demons and devils, and the great lords are no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Richard suddenly stopped and looked to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that direction, there is an extremely violent outburst. His perception instantly crossed a vast distance, and he saw two big lords in the distance fighting in desperation. They are full of scars everywhere, and they don’t know how long they have been fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the devil's big lord suddenly screamed, and the giant sword in his hand burned with purple fire, and instantly penetrated the chest of the demon lord! The roar of the demon lord was earth-shattering, but it was not unwilling, and it eventually fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and prepared to continue on his way. But the devil's big lord found him, so he rushed with the sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the ruling and waited quietly. Although the devil's big lord is as high as 35, it has just experienced a bloody battle, all over the body, and the strength is not even half of the heyday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard slashed the head of the devil's big lord and ended the battle. He cut out the core of the devil and instinctively wants to eat it. But in the end, he hesitated a bit, then put the core into the space bracelet, and continued to move forward without face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has long been a dark injury, and he urgently needs the core energy supplement. However, the accumulation of toxic substances in Richard's body is also approaching the critical point, so under the trade-off, Richard can take the risk of moving forward and dare not eat more of the devil's core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the slope of the earth at the moment has finally begun to slow down, meaning that Richard is close to the end of the bloody battlefield. Moving forward, it should be the real end of the world. The legendary passage connecting the world's light and dark sides is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Richard’s spirit has been aroused, but it has slowed down and he has to give himself more time to recover his injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another three days, Richard and No Face finally came out of the bloody battlefield. As soon as Richard stepped past the invisible boundary, he suddenly felt that the rules around him had changed into another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment his head is no longer a low-pitched black-red sky, but an endless void. In the void, you can see countless stars. In the front, there are huge mountains that stretch endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s eyes fell above the mountains. In the void there, there is a very large vortex that is slowly spinning, occupying almost half of the sky, big enough to make people suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diameter of this vortex is nearly a thousand kilometers, and there is constant darkness in the center of the vortex, and then slowly dip into the surroundings. It was pure darkness, quiet and flowing, but let Richard feel the incomparable oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is also watching the huge whirlpool in the air, for the first time, some lost, said: "This is the passage to the dark side of the world. Those black, It is the energy that is immersed in the dark side of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually calmed down from the initial shock and said, "I want to study the dark side of the world here." Rules, when you are sure, you will go there to see. But it takes time, you can go back to Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly don't Go back.” No face refused Richard’s suggestion and said, “Do you think it would be so easy to go to the dark side of the world?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
