Begin to concentrate on the terrain and the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the twilight is on the bloody land, the sunset is like blood, and a thick layer of blood is applied to the earth. When Richard was studying the situation, the door of the war room was gently tapped, and then Philen entered the war room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chatou did not raise his head and said: "I haven’t thought about it yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, so I will help you make a decision." Fioren's voice was extraordinarily soft, and then a burst of sound was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken aback, looked up and saw that Philen was pulling the strap of the robe, the body was gently twisted, and the robe went down the body. Slip to your feet. She pulled the belt of the inner skirt again, and the inner skirt also fell quietly, so the grand priest of the goddess of spring water stood in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren is a mature beauty, the body is exudes a faint glow, warm and delicate, unbelievable, every inch of skin is a complex of holiness and temptation . And her identity makes this beautiful temptation multiply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and said, "What do you mean by the Philippine priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fellen took a step closer to Richard. During the walk, her beauty seemed to be projected on the waterfall through the sunshine of the jungle. She whispered: "As long as you are willing to send troops, it is a great contribution to the goddess. And I am willing to dedicate myself to the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are beautiful... Licha appreciated the Philip's **, but his eyes were clear and clear, and there was no intention of shaking his mind. He did not avoid her sensitive parts, nor did he deliberately take a look. Richard’s performance is like that Fioren still wears clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firen’s heart was shocked, and she suddenly shook her head and said, “But this is not enough. I don’t want to sacrifice my warrior unnecessarily, and I don’t want to let me The enemies are awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen floated the most touching smile and said, "If you like, I think the other two goddesses are the same I am willing to give it. Even I can call them now, and then together... In addition to us, any priest and pastor in the temple, whenever you like, can offer for the goddess at any time!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen was a tempting smile at first, but the more he talked about it, the more sensational the content, and her tone and expression became more determined and sacred. Richard carefully discerned, but found that the priest was really ready to do, as a dedication to the goddess. This may seem ridiculous, but it is not so difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of the plane of the gods is a very important part of the late war. Based on the deep blue heritage, Richard has an understanding of the general rules of the gods. After getting Clark's allegiance, with the book of the gods of his sacrifice, the sand has compiled the sequence of Faro's power, and with the help of Clark, he got several principles of the distribution of the power of the plane. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the final analysis, there is no fundamental difference between the basic rules of the distribution of the power of the Faro plane and all the planes of the true God. Although the concept of war has not yet been able to war with the face, and whether the Faro gods refer to the invaders as evil spirits, demons, enemies of all beings, or whatever, in the field of God, the plane war still has a very important position. The more power there is in the plane war, the greater the role played, and the successful elimination of the invaders will qualify for more divine power distribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important channel for the weak gods to enhance their power. Especially for the three goddesses, the extremely weak god who is dangerous to keep the priesthood, it is simply a straw for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the clergy do not say that dedication, that is, life and soul, will not hesitate to sacrifice when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me about the benefits you can get, I am very clear about the goddess," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen feels a little weird and embarrassed, she is standing in front of Richard, and at your fingertips, but also a serious and Richard Discuss the business. This made her involuntarily nervous, she wanted to use her hand to block sensitive parts, but her hand was just lifted and she put it down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She forced herself to calm down and reached out to manage her hair, not to say: "You have seen it, I am with Fermi and Xiyou because Your temple has been built in Oasis City, and some believers have been developed, and you have been rewarded by the goddess and raised the level of magic. If this plane war can win and you play a major role in it, to the goddess It is a decisive contribution, and I, by this feat, may be directly designated by the goddess as the pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken aback, he knew Feilun’s harvest will not be small, but he did not expect it to be so big. Even if the goddess' power is weak, it is still unattainable for all students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my future role as a pope, is this enough to make you tempted?" Say, Fayen took another step, if he leaned forward, The tallest part can touch Richard. She opened a holy smile and placed her hand on Richard's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and took the hand of Philen and said, "I have enough respect for the three goddesses, and it is the same for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairen bit his lower lip and looked at Richard with some sadness and said, "What about you, will you help me? Just be me, or What the goddess can do, can do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the answer that Richard wants, and he has long thought about the conditions of the transaction, still After a while, I said: "In fact, it is very simple. I am full of respect for the three goddesses. Although I cannot be attributed to the goddess's belief, with my dedication, I hope to get the title of three goddess gods. In addition, In the future, if necessary, I want to be able to launch a conscription against me in the name of three goddesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairn sucked Cool! This is more than the price she can imagine beforehand. The name of the gods does not matter. After she saw the power of sand drifting, she did not feel that Richard would be interested in the power of the three goddesses at this stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the war in the name of God is not because of God's will, but because of the will of the living, which is the most arrogant monarch can't imagine. This is tantamount to tying the three goddesses to Richard's chariot, or to be more objective. From then on, the three goddesses will be forced to advance and retreat with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition has gone far beyond the rights of Philen. She only felt that her throat was dry and could not be said in one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long known that this is the case, and throws the final bait: "If the three goddesses are willing to promise me this little condition, then I, Li Check out Archimonde, and you will do your best to fight the invaders!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha politely pulled up the hand of Philen and came to Before the magic topographic map, reach out at the junction of the bloody land and the turbulent land and say, “Here, it is the fall of the invaders!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philun’s heart beats uncontrollably, as if to see the Pope’s scepter waving to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned to look at her and smiled and said: "If you can get the care of the three goddesses, it is best, but even if there is only one goddess. Willing to accept my dedication, I will also fight the invaders in the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferren’s heart is jumping faster and faster, his chest is undulating, but it is full The chest is shaking. She suddenly said: "I will report this matter to the goddess immediately, please be sure to wait for my news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she rushed to her clothes. Prepare to go to the temple to pray immediately. However, when her clothes were half-dressed, she suddenly stopped, her face changed, and finally looked up. She said with great joy to Richard: "The goddess’ eyes have always been concerned about this. She just knew me through me. Sincerity, and conveyed the gods. Your request, the goddess has completely agreed. I can do everything tonight, and tomorrow I will be able to hold the sacred gods and give you the ritual of the spear of the gods." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and smiled slightly above, saying, "Thank you for the kindness of the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fellen stopped the dressing action and said softly: "Although the goddess has already agreed to your request, my initial proposal is still valid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard showed a charming smile and said, "I am also looking forward to it. But now, it is obviously a time to prepare for it. When we completely eliminate the intruders, I will seriously consider this suggestion."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellen bit his teeth and said: "This... okay! However, my suggestion will be one. Effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, Philen had calmed down, leaving a very tempting smile to Richard, telling him with his eyes that she was extremely Looking forward to the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Fien left the war room, Richard only punched a fist, snorted, and the excitement was overwhelming. As long as he wins this war, he can say that he is completely rooted in Faro. In the name of the three goddesses, anyone who wants to expose the true face of his invaders will be very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how the three goddesses decide, in fact, Richard has to fight the invaders. Because these intruders are clearly directed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately communicated with the mother's nest, and the consciousness of the mother's nest was intermittent and seemed very tired. This is a situation that has never happened. Richard’s heart is tight and he asks immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I am trying to create a nest, just built and consume a lot of energy, so it's a little weak, after I eat again, it's fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Nest?" Richard caught a new term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is a cellular-like facility where worker bees provide nutrients for the nest, and I can create semi-finished combat units that are in the nest Continue to grow until it is finished. In the nest, a combat unit such as a feather snake takes a week to fully grow, and a windy tooth only takes an extra day. In addition, if I only create semi-finished products, every day The number of creations can be increased by an additional one-third."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where does the nutrient of the nest come from?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
