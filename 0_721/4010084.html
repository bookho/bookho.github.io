If the attack speed is doubled, the damage will be more than doubled. Don't say there are many additional effects! The trigger probability will also increase with the number of overlays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Nyris understands visually why a high-level constructor has an impact on the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris also stopped the action of eating, and struggled for a long time in his heart, asking: "Father, should I find a way to go to Faro, and Lee?" Check out the battle plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp cuts a piece of meat weighing one kilogram and throws it into his mouth, then says: "The vast territory of Faro Only one step can become the main plane. Such a plane is infinite, and the average number of sub-planes is not as good as it is. You are not looking at the value of Faro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris smiled and said: "The number of planes can be much larger than the real big builder. If I want to open up the plane, I can apply for one without you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp nodded and said, "Then you talk about why you want to go to Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Nyres solemnly said this time: "A really strong bond should be based on the interests, plus friendship. The real friendship can not be exchanged for several transactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Philip smiled and said, "You are smarter than your brothers, but still not enough. Well, you can do whatever you want, this year you deserve the subsidy and war budget, you can Increase 30%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is very excited and said loudly: "Thank you father!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp These wealthy children understand that a little more resources means that the cornerstone of progress is more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this twilight moment, the deep blue of the ice floes suddenly slammed. The grandmother of Su Hailun who disappeared for a long time appeared again in the dark blue, the same wolf as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of a large magister, the legendary mage unloaded a lot of inexplicable things from the space equipment, and a hill appeared immediately in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what she has fished out of the singular space of the various planes and even the turbulent flow of time. It may be worthless, or it may be worthless. But even if it turns out to be useless, it can always sell high prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The items that can be seen by Su Helun and occupy valuable space on her are always a bit special. This kind of thing from the plane travel is high in other places. The Master of the Order is of great value. Even if it is useless, it proves that they are not using the process itself, that is, the value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to study an item from the turbulent time, but a rare opportunity, that means standing to a height beyond the plane to observe the plane rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen has never been so hard before. So in recent months, all the great magisters gathered in the dark blue, waiting for the auction to be held irregularly. Of course, in the eyes of Su Hailun, this should actually be called scrap clearance. Although the legendary wizards are all good-faced, I am embarrassed to come to the deep blue, but most of them quietly sent a knowledgeable agent to come over and prepare to rush something back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness! Your Fruit!" Black Gold took the lessons of the previous few times. Before he finished unloading, he sent a huge space ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage took a glimpse of the ring and placed it on the middle finger. Her long middle finger has already set two rings. Seeing this little detail, the great wizards know that the strength of the legendary mage has increased. Even with the legendary ranks, the gap between the twenty magic rings and the two rings is decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Su Helun had to leave again, Phil Master stood up and hurriedly said, "His Royal Highness! Here is a letter from you! Very important! Yes... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see it again next time!" said the legendary Master lazily. The juvenile shape of the portal has already appeared between the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Richard’s letter to you!” Phil finally said the key words. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master was shocked, and his hands slammed the half-formed portal out of the window. The violent magical energy of the group quickly expanded during the flight, and then finally reached the limit of instability thousands of meters away, bursting silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating over the bay, there was a very bright spot, and then a black sun rose, and countless energy rushed into the black. Inside the ball of light, the edge of the ball is constantly exploding with golden lightning. When the black sun finally annihilated, the whole space seemed to be distorted, and then a real sun appeared in the sea between the clouds, and the blazing light once made the whole world shine bright white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible seismic waves spread across the deep blue majestic tower, inspiring all the dark magic defense arrays. For a time, if there is a hurricane blowing! The elemental cloud and arcane energy that linger on the top of the magic tower evoke the most violent reaction, and the radiance of the five colors is faint, as if the legendary heavenly glory is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is filled with waves of tens of meters high, and the layers are pushed to the coast, eventually igniting the black waves and then the cliffs of 100 meters. Crush on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the sound...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue, all the big magisters are silent, they feel The magical energy that is close at hand is beyond imagination, and even the idea of ​​getting a defensive magical body in time is not going to rise. And just a few of the great magisters who saw this scene opened their mouths and looked dull. They didn't even notice the wand falling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a great magister said in a very cognac voice: "Is it.... Is that the legendary magic of His Highness?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big magister whispered, "That... I can ask, is it really magic that I just saw?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one answered him this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large conference room on the top floor, the seventeen deep blue magical guides are also silent, shocked, oh, all kinds of looks solid on the face, for a moment can not be their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s expression was originally no different from them, but it was going to recover soon. By such a time difference, she immediately wiped the cold sweat from her head and put on a proud attitude that should of course be so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the big magic guides turned their heads at the same time, and all eyes fell on Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage squinted with both hands and said with a sigh of relief: "What are you looking at? Is there any good-looking? Just letting go of a magic, what's the big deal! And you Phil, next time I remember to focus directly, don't always talk to me at such a slow pace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes immediately gathered on Phil . As the initiator of this accident, Master Phil could no longer maintain his calm and calm, his forehead began to sweat, smiled and promised, and then handed Richard's letter to the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun snorted and read the letter repeatedly. The letter was just a line of words, but she read it a dozen times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the magic letterhead, Richard also branded a complex set of space formulas with magic. If you parse this set of formulas, you will get a set of plane coordinates. At the speed of the legendary Master, Su Hailun also spent some time to get this set of coordinates. If it is an ordinary big magister, even if you see the formula, you can't count the coordinates. Even the legendary mage, if there is no plane travel experience, or space magic expertise, rely on alchemy equipment and spend more time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master suddenly had a radiance and cheered, saying: "My little Richard actually laid a plane! I have to go see! You are busy with yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Su Helun took off a Bethelic spider ape on the ponytail. Now she also learned to use a spider like things as a headgear. Fortunately, the legendary mage has always been a single ponytail, if it is also like the mountains and the sea with seven or eight small scorpions on the head, this scene can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun's long five fingers penetrated into the arachnid, and for a moment, there was a dazzling light spot inside the arachnid! Then the horror energy contained in the arachnoid was fully stimulated, and was almost immediately converted into the required magic by the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, an incomparably gorgeous rainbow appeared in the hands of Su Helun, extending out from the window and going straight to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage stepped on the Hongqiao step by step, and turned himself into a rainbow. He suddenly broke through the space at the end of the sky and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another exclamation in the dark blue:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bridge of Rainbow Light! Legendary Magic Avision Bridge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the Highness of Su Hailun! Is Your Highness able to display the Bridge of Rainbow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rainbow Bridge is a high-level legendary magic used to determine the plane of the coordinates when the coordinates are shuttled. Although this magic caused an exclamation, but compared with the space shock of the horrible space, it is not at all an order of magnitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of the Shihong Bridge are fast and straightforward, without having to spend time building complex portals. The disadvantage is that the cost is too high, at least one spider crystal is consumed for transmission, that is, it is about ten million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage has been away for a few minutes, but the big magisters in the conference room still do not move, you look at me, I look at you. In the end, Master Phil stood up and said something that everyone would not want to export: "I feel that when I return next time, it is necessary to ask her to change the transmission location to the dark blue tower platform."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
