This is the only iron law recognized as a plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bridge is built between two planes, it can only be a war of extinction, and there is no other possibility. Richard just wants to understand why it is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale wars of a small scale will often last for decades, and the number of deaths and injuries will eventually be in the millions, or even tens of millions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is not pedantic, and will not simply judge his right or wrong because of his mood. As a powerful main plane, Noland has built thousands of links. The war between these planes has continued, and many plane wars have lasted for hundreds of years. Any plane, no matter how big or small, wants peace and ultimately only two ways, either extinct, or completely conquered, and then slowly extinct. Since so many planes are like this, then there must be some truth. Richard didn't understand, it was because he didn't understand, but he couldn't say that the plane war was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard faintly felt that when all planes were wars, it was difficult to say reasonable. Behind the scenes, there must be some reason, but no one can tell. In Noland, all nobles received the education of the plane war from an early age, and believed that conquering the ectopic face is a matter of righteousness. Not only the nobles, but the strongest of Noland. Almost every strongman has been tempered by the blood of the plane war. Every family must have at least one prosperous exclusive plane behind it to gain a foothold in the war-torn Noland continent, thus inheriting the family name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane war seems to be the instinct of all the intelligent races of Noland. Not only humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, but even barbarians. If you expand it, not only Noland, but also other equally powerful main planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed, shook his glass of wine and drank half of the spirits. He is laughing at himself. The history of the plane has been hundreds of thousands of years. I don’t know how many amazing and amazing people. They have not been able to break the secrets of the plane war, but they are all rushing into the plane war. What are you thinking about in this chaos, and what qualifications are there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Faro's plane war, Richard himself will not rise so fast, and will not accumulate huge wealth in a short period of time. And have the power to control their own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he picked up the bottle and filled himself with a glass of wine, a pen figure was flowing through his heart. There are a number of structures, there are inflows of gold coins and wealth, there are troops that gradually expand under the arm, and the strength and rank of themselves and followers are steadily improved, but more are the countless lives that died in front of his soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard is in a very strange state. He thinks a lot, but these are all automatically popped up, and he does not need to go to the brain to search. After drinking the glass of wine and picking up the bottle, he found that the hand was light and the bottle was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and felt that he was still very awake, but the burning arousal in his heart was more obvious, and he could not stand it. However, Richard did not understand where his problem was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively took out a blank piece of magic paper, took out the artifact magic pen that never left, and began to apply a large line and characters on the paper. A mixture of numbers and numbers. Even Richard didn't know what he was painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon a piece of paper was covered, and Richard felt that something that had been accumulated in his heart seemed to be transferred to the magic paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened a bottle of strong whiskey and poured himself a full cup, then stood at the window and sipped slowly. Unknowingly, a glass of wine was empty and full, and a bottle of wine gradually bottomed out, eventually becoming an empty bottle that was thrown into the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, a new bottle cap fell on the floor, bounced lightly, rolled to the door, and finally stopped in a pair In front of the snow white feet with slippers. It ran into a toe that was tender as if it were dripping water, and it lay down lazily. Then, a nearly perfect hand picked up the bottle cap and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pair of sky blue eyes, crystal clear as the purest sapphire. And her face, in the eyes of the most discerning people, can not find a trace of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Qi Qi, she is wearing a soft long skirt, long hair loose shoulders, standing at the door of the study, falling silent. Her gaze first passed through the study, slammed on three or four empty bottles thrown on the floor, and then looked at the two bottles of spirits still on the table, and finally looked at the station. Richard meditating in front of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her breath is cold and with a scent of vegetation, almost no sense of existence. And Richard’s roar in his ears at this moment, there are countless pictures flashing in consciousness, and he did not notice the arrival of Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha couldn’t remember how much he had drunk, just raised his toast and found that the cup was empty. He wanted to find wine, but he couldn't stand it. He had to put the glass on the window sill and stabilize his body first. However, the bottle floated over and filled the wine with the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard instinctively picked up the glass and drank it. This reminds me where the wine came from. So he turned back, saw the bottle, saw the beautiful hands holding the bottle, and then followed his arms and shoulders until his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her for half a minute before frowning and said, "珞琪?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;珞琪 only nodded, standing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the empty glass in his hand and somehow reached the front of Qi Qi. Qi Qi was poured into the glass. When Richard sipped it, he extended the glass. Qi Qi obviously hesitated, whispered: "You can't drink any more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha double eyebrows, Qi Qi then no longer insists, He is full of a cup. Richard didn't have a drink this time. He stood at the window and pointed his finger at the endless starry sky. He murmured, "Do you know, that guy should always stand here..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words did not finish, the wine glass in the hands of Richard suddenly landed, the body swayed, and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi hurriedly held Richard, but Richard’s body was unexpectedly heavy, and she almost brought her to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also felt that he was not right, struggling to stand firm, but now the only support is Qi Qi, so he almost climbed Qi Qi Climb up. The skin of the two people is almost close together, and the tall body of Qi Qi is both soft and tough. At the foot of Richard, he was unstable and planted on the ground. He subconsciously reached out and grabbed the skirt of Qi Qi. With a bang, the long skirt of Qi Qi was almost split in half! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a complete long leg, like a straight snow, stands in front of Li, and even at the end of the thigh. The temptation of Qi Qi is spread all over the body. Richard’s body stiffened and suddenly reached out and grabbed Qi’s leg and stood up. He was very heavy under this one, and Qi Qi’s body twitched slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up straight, staring at Qi Qi’s eyes, and the breath was full of alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression on Qi Qi’s face, but the eyes are not looking back and looking at Li, the little mouth is slightly open, and the mouth seems to be I have to spit out a thick mouth. Very pure and cold, proud Qi Qi, but it seems to be the next moment to burst into a foul mouth. A strong sense of dislocation, almost bursting out of Richard. Richard gritted his teeth and grinded out from the teeth: "Are you looking for death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard reached out and grabbed Qi Qi’s neckline and forced it to tear. Her top and her bodice were torn apart, and her upper body was also smashed/exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Qi Qi’s response was to suddenly bury his head and bite on Richard’s shoulder! This mouth she has used the power of the whole body, and Richard's body trembled, making a beastly roar. However, his body is quite straight, not only does not hide, but also sent to the mouth of Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now a madman, completely drowning in reason, but to see if she really can bite a piece of meat. Qi Qi is also absolutely unwelcome, biting hard, but Richard's muscles are tight, hard like steel, so that Qi Qi teeth began to bleed, and did not bite Richard's muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly loosened her mouth and stood in front of Richard, looking at Liby without expression, but her chin was slightly raised. Not arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest level of provocation, I just look down on you, how can you take me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, pulled Qi Qi directly and pressed it on the floor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tears, the last clothes on Qi Qi’s body were turned into rags and scattered all over the place. She struggled to wriggle, but it didn't work. Suddenly, Qi Qi's eyebrows were locked, and the head leaned back, giving a painful dumb call. The hands were holding on to Richard's body, and the nails penetrated deeply into the skin on Richard's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Qi Qi is like a lonely boat in a storm, throwing and falling in a fierce impact. She could no longer hold the cold and reserved, her eyebrows were almost twisted together, her eyes closed, and the crying like a cry from the depths of her throat was more and more hoarse, and her body was twitching irregularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 felt that he could collapse at any time and fainted, but he could not do so. Richard on her body, fierce and brutal, like a fierce mammoth, it is hard to imagine that he is not so strong in the body, there will be such a volcanic eruption-like power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 felt that she had been crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when the storm suddenly stopped, Qi Qi had lost all her strength, lying on the ground, only breathing. After relaxing, the sweat on her body emerged layer by layer, and the sweat on her forehead was dense and rainy, completely wetting her long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also exhausted his physical energy and fell on her, so he fell asleep and gave a slight snoring from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi finally had some strength and wanted to push Richard down, but just after the action, the two eyebrows were twisted together and involuntarily issued A sigh. It turned out that although Richard had already sprayed and filled her body, the male character was still standing like a gun, that is, big and long, and she almost swelled to the limit. With such a move, it immediately affected the wound of the lower body, such as acupuncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
