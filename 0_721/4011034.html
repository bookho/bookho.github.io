			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless summoners and reaper units in the sky, and they are inseparable from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's dragon's breath, the devil's melt, the devil's eroded light ball, staggered in the sky, there are death traps everywhere, everywhere Exploding reaper fighters and dying callers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battlefield of chaos, there is a rather special creature, which is only two meters long, very cute little dragon, Tiama special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat has been restless these days, always feeling that something very bad happened, so I can’t eat and sleep. As a result, today, the hunch is realized. Without any warning, it is forced to propose the dragon country by a strong contractual force, and then it is extremely violently thrown into a completely strange environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat opened his eyes, in front of it was a medium-sized fighter, less than three meters apart, and the muzzle of the aircraft was gathering light, full of death breath. Obviously the next moment is a terrible attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat screamed, instinctively glimpsed forward, and a paw smashed the pile of strange metal. Then it reacts to what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an evil dragon that has survived for a long time, Tiamat naturally knows the Reaper and has seen images of some common fighters of the Reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the appearance of the reapers in each plane is not the same, but in this order of the world, this all-metal creation without soul is only harvested. Only have become the mark of their invariance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper is perhaps the second most dangerous word after Su Helen, and Tiamat is completely awake at once, almost scared the dragon soul to fly from the body. Go out. It subconsciously twists the body and grows bigger. The huge body shape is the source of strength. However, this change immediately attracted the attention of the surrounding reaper units. At this time, Tiamat also saw how many reapers were around! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of sight is almost filled by the reaper! Is there tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands? Richard forcibly summoned all the dragons of the Dragon Kingdom, originally to fight the Reaper? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Tiamat knew clearly that it was very difficult to deal with thousands of fighters with the dragon in the dragon country. Now the reaper is now ten times more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to fight, but to be killed immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing hundreds of high-energy beams and dozens of metal kinetic energy bombs coming, Tiamat was so frightened that he screamed: "Lecha! I Hate you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most critical moment, the evil dragon survival instinct made the right choice, it changed shape instantly, and turned itself into a meter-long mini Xiaolong status. As a result, countless attacks aimed at it suddenly fell empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-energy beam is all right, and the kinetic energy that whizzes and goes to make Tiamat’s heart beat faster. As long as it is a flesh-and-blood creature, there is no such thing as not afraid of it. Being blasted by a kinetic energy will immediately evaporate a large entity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat is, after all, the evil dragon that is tied to Bahamut’s power, life and death, it also spurs tyrannical power, flying like electricity, Shoot a fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It immediately found that there were too many bombs in the chaotic battlefield, it was too dangerous, but there was a strange open space in the Reaper fighter group, where the stray bullets were exceptional. Less, and the Reaper fighters seem to be moving away from the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sky is a high-energy beam. There is no safe place. If you stay in a certain place for a moment, you will be caught by the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat almost immediately thought about it and immediately instinctively rushed to the airspace! As soon as I entered there, the pressure was as light as it expected, and almost no reapers attacked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the surprise, Tiamat saw something strange in the airspace ahead. It stared at it, and under the deep night, it seemed that there were some extra dark stripes, they were gathering in one place, and outlined a round ball silhouette! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat, who had traveled many times in the void, immediately recognized what it was! It is a black hole! It is a black hole made by Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat’s hysterical call is: “Le Richard! I hate you forever!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns around and runs, but the flight speed is exceptionally slow. It is simply away from the black hole at the speed of the snail. Tiamat understood at this time why the Reaper fighters did not attack it because they were also running away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden change in the mind of Richard, who seemed to have been cursed or hated. But this level of threat is even lower than the scream of a fly, and Richard immediately ignores it, and there is no distraction to think about the existence of a curse that will make him feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has all his attention in front, he continues to rush at the highest speed, straight to the mother ship in the middle of the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard is getting faster and faster, the kinetic energy bomb has not been able to catch up with him, only the high-energy beam is constantly shooting, and there is a little spark on him. Richard did not evade, so he took the fire with a fire, like a meteor to the mother ship in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of dive, the power of the entire Faro continued to be added to Richard, and even the origin of the plane was infiltrated into Richard through the regular channels. in vivo! This is Faro’s spontaneous counterattack and resistance to the destiny of destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not touched the water level, the seawater has been pressed, and suddenly receded until the seabed is exposed! The mother ship in the slanting sea has been fully presented to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar, Richard slammed into the shield of the mother ship at full speed! The shroud suddenly flashed like a new round of rising sun! Then it couldn’t bear the impact of a super strongman’s force on the entire plane, and it’s broken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead is as light as a butterfly, falling on the outer wall of the mother ship, he lifts the moonlight, pierces the mother ship's ship's wall with the sharp edge of the artifact, and then light Light shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the humming sound, the mother ship suddenly appeared on the hull of the mirror like a myriad of dense lines, and then there was light in each gap, then a dazzling blindness The flash of the spurt came out, and for a time the whole of the Faro was a day of whiteness, and even Richard had to close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that the flash was slightly weakened, and immediately opened his eyes and released his perception. Just in front of Richard, the mother ship has been turned into countless parts, and because it is a mother ship, the parts are not reactivated, but float in the air under the power of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, all the reapers stopped their actions and floated quietly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the eye quickly, with a big hand, immediately put all the parts together, and then picked out a brick-sized silver metal from the inside. This is the essence of the remnant of the remnant, the last remaining reserve of this mother ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has once again picked out several complete components, which are the most important components such as suspected reactivation devices and control centers. He just went down with a knife, and the vibration contained the power of powerful rules, which instantly disintegrated the mother ship. These still intact parts are the part of Richard's failure to reversely resolve, so that it cannot be disintegrated, and it is also the core secret of the mother ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While taking advantage of the original strength of the Faro plane, Richard repaired his injuries while searching for the surroundings as much as possible, not letting the mother ship even the tiniest complete parts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is shining in the sky, it is no face, Asa and others are coming at full speed. All the reapers lost their vitality in an instant, and they naturally knew that Richard’s assault on the mother ship was successful. The most important question for them now is how Richard’s injury is. They all saw a horrible fighter tornado around the mother ship, in which case Richard could still assault the mother ship successfully. Then his injury is light as long as he does not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently breathed a sigh of relief, and he could feel that the first thing he came over would be no face. At this moment, he really has no power left, and both Asa and Goshawk can easily kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard has a subtle feeling that he will be safe as long as he has no face. This is an unspeakable sense of trust. Even if it does not achieve this level of trust in the mountains and the sea, Freire is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no face to the first to rush to Richard, her figure flashed, has been stopped in front of Goshawk and Asa, smiled and said: "Li Cha did not Wearing clothes is somewhat inconvenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk and Asa looked at each other and the goshawk smiled: "Well, let's go outside the fog wall." Etc..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea!" No face immediately agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also relaxed at this time. In the weak state, the proximity of another super strong would indeed make him instinctively nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
