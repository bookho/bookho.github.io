			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard understood that the same kind of Saranwell he thought of. His answer is probably the same as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of Richard’s station is the high point of the Cold Iron Throne. When he turns around, he can overlook most of the city and the current status of this Faro city. Closed to the bottom of my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people are there?" Richard suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell said, "I haven’t had time to count. But originally I evacuated people from the surrounding area into the city. At that time, there were eight hundred. Ten thousand people. And now... there are about two million people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the explosive drum in his hand and said: The thing you designed is very easy to use. Maybe it can be kept here, I mean next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final emphasis of Richard makes Saranville silence. He knew very well that even if Richard gave him the support he needed, the best result would be to hold on to the next attack. And who knows how many fighters and how many fighters will the Reaper have in the third round of attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Saranwell and said, "I can trust you again, for you, and for the two million people here. I can give you The reinforcements will be available the day after tomorrow. This time I will give you two thousand human knights and three hundred night elves. This thing can be tied to the arrow and shot by the night elves. As for the humanoid knight... you can use it freely." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell’s eyes brightened, and he grabbed Richard’s hand tightly, but he was so excited that he didn’t know what to say. There are not many supporters for Richard, but how can he not know how precious the nesting combat units and high-ranking arms are in this environment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a picture of Saranwell’s hand and said, “But I also have a condition. After the next battle, no matter how much alive there is. People must evacuate immediately! We have no possibility to hold the fourth attack here, and I have no extra strength to give it to you when I arrive. By that time, it is time to give fate to heaven, survivors need Immediately move to the Crimson Kingdom. Maybe... they can reach their destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarrenville solemnly said: "I understand, I will be with my people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, there is an extra requirement for you. After the next war, you, there are some people you think are important, you must take the fly to leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville also wants to argue, but the words are interrupted by Richard: "This is not a suggestion, It's an order. You can choose not to obey, but in this case, you will not have reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville pointed to the busy people below, Low shouted: "But there are two million people here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not allowed to say, "There are still 50 million people in the Crimson Kingdom." There are still hundreds of millions of people in the southern countries! If you put these soldiers in your dark red kingdom, you can save more than two million people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...but I am..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha interrupted Saranwell again: "You are the emperor of the Iron Triangle Empire, and I am the co-owner of the whole Faro. You are responsible for the people of the Empire, I Need to be responsible for the entire Faro! In my eyes, the people of any country are the same, the people of the Iron Triangle Empire are no more superior than those of other countries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell’s face changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally said: "You will get the reinforcements you want, but you have to abide by my conditions. There are still many places where you can help me in the future. Our war with the Reapers will always pass, we will win, and Faro has not yet reached the moment of destruction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville sighed and said "I also believe that we will win. But when we are victorious, Faro is estimated not to be far from destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a shot Ronwell’s shoulder said, “As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we must persist! If the algorithm is really destroyed, our people can go to other planes to continue living.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As for the reapers who destroyed the No. 4 battlefield, wherever, there was a tacit agreement between Allen and Richard. No one mentioned it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard took the messenger and flew back to the No. 1 battlefield in the turbulent land, a series of dispatch orders were sent out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard shrank all the troops and pulled them to the second line of defense. As for those outside the line of defense, they are all evacuated to the line of defense. In this way, after a few days, Richard’s troops only need to hold the two battlefields No. 1 and No. 2, and they can get stuck in the reaper’s marching line. Even if a small number of reapers are infiltrated, highly mobile powerhouses can kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the completion of the deployment, no face suddenly said to Richard: "Do you want to chase those reapers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On us?" Richard's expression was obviously said to be in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's us, but it doesn't include you. You have to go back to Noland to sacrifice and see what good things you can come over. You There is no construction during this time, and our point redemption system can support a maximum of one period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still need to redeem points?" Richard frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the system is still running, we will continue to generate revenue. These are the military expenses for your war! Otherwise, you think you played From this war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that this is a fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the huge wealth brought by the points system, he will not finally make up his mind to fight the reaper. The points system brings not only wealth to Richard, but also dozens of legendary powerhouses from the depths of the plane, as well as hundreds of sacred domains, all of which are fighting for Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if I am not there, how can you beat those reapers?" Richard was worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't always be, we are not fighting the same thing? What's more, you can beat me now? My body artifact suppresses your three knives." Isn't it a trivial matter?" No face-to-face continuous questioning made Richard speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard handed over all the followers and the military’s dispatching power to the faceless, and the two messengers separated. Li Chahao returned to Lanshui Oasis City. went. No face and mountains and sea go west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a few messengers were raised from the battlefield on the 2nd and 3rd, Zonghu, Shuihu, Twilight, and later joined the Iron Shield, Keane, etc. The legendary strongman also flew west to meet with no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard left, the mountains and the sea remained silent, seemingly thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a face change, sit next to the mountain and the sea, and some casually say: "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea finally saw a faceless look. In her impression, she is not familiar with facelessness, and she does not like this strange figure. However, the lack of face at the moment gave her a feeling of peace of mind and inability to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea suddenly approached no face, the little nose sniffed and said: "You have a taste that makes me like."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless voice brought a little surprise: "Can you... smell the fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea face, then slowly opened a faint smile, said: "Your taste makes me like it, so I believe in you. Yes, I can smell a little bit of fate. This is the ability that the beast god has given me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Funny ability. Is there any restriction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only smell the fate associated with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face sighs: "It is already incredible. It seems that your existence Will make the beast gods extinct in other descendants of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea have a little surprise, ask: "Why?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of destiny is nothing But above all power. If you have to give an explanation, it will be the result of all the relevant rules. You should also understand now that it is very difficult to analyze a rule system and want to master the power of destiny. It is equivalent to mastering the rules of the whole world. You can smell the fate, indicating that you have the ability to influence most rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain I was even more surprised with the sea. I didn’t even think that my little ability in my heart didn’t feel so powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are blessed. So, because of your existence, other descendants of the beast will be abandoned by the world. They will encounter all kinds of troubles. Until completely disappeared from the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea did not expect it to be like this. I was shocked to ask: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. It's just that in the past, such things happened when it happened. When an ancient blood suddenly appears as a child of a very powerful destiny, the other descendants of this blood will gradually decline." No face said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea thought about it and asked: "Can I see those descendants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp No face said: "Not necessarily, they may be scattered in every corner of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea frowning, but can’t think of anything else What will the descendants look like. She couldn't think of it, she didn't want to, she shook her head hard and took her troubles to the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the face of this Caledonian sage, he tempted to ask: "Do you know Richard, because of the taste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence reminds the mountains and the sea of ​​the past, she recalls, unconsciously smiles, and unconsciously lit the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! His taste is particularly good, and at that time, among the many people I met in Noland, only he didn’t want me. The money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the girl tells the story of the past. She has been talking for a long time, and she has been listening for a long time without face. Especially what she said is only what happened in the dark blue. In such a short period of time, what can happen is necessarily a small matter. However, as long as it is related to Richard, even the tiniest details, the mountains and the sea are clearly remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that he later went to Calando to find you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea suddenly Silence, after a long time, whispered: "Yes. I regret it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face oh, ask: "Why? He is not successful in taking you Did you take Calando away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea looked at the front, and the sight did not know where it fell, saying: "At that moment, the established destiny was changed. I don't know what it has become, but when I gave up the Holy Totem and came to Noland, I suddenly found myself unable to help him. I have no power and no wealth. What am I? Will not do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
