			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A groaning bang, two big Hans are separated, Odom The horse's hind legs were soft and almost fell. Gangde also snorted and bleed. In addition to the effect of the structure, Gangde has a total of seven magical and magical enhancements, so the front of the hard fight Odom, but also suffered a small loss. But successfully curbed the impact of the sanctuary strong. This is the key to this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard re-seduce himself and continually issue orders of consciousness. The air began to sound like a fierce scream, and a gray cloud swept over the top of the front row of warriors and landed in the cavalry behind Odom. This is the poisonous bone blade of the throwing soldier. Within 30 meters, the power can break the plate of the heavy ride. After three rounds of rapid throwing, the heavy riders have been injured in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the regular army and the stables began to appear. If the opponent is a red Cossack cavalry, only these three rounds of throwing will make the opponent's charge formation ruin. However, although the team of reloading knights has been deformed, several places have been torn apart, but they are still sweeping like a steel torrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a dark gray light flashed, and the charge of the top ten rides in the front suddenly became slow. They finally entered the range of Shen Mei's casting, and her wide range of slowness was extremely sharp against the cavalry charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull and violent collision continued to sound, and the heavy riders finally ran into Richard’s front, and the two rows of barbarian warriors joined forces, although there were also several fronts. The heavy ride broke, but the entire line of defense was fairly complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian made a scream, took out the battle axe, and began to fight with the stalled cavalry! However, they are not the most feared slaughter, and more than a hundred humanoid warriors crossed the barbarian front and rushed into the cavalry queue. They are all expressionless, and they are heavy and embarrassed, and there are only enemies in their eyes. Even if they have a sword and a sword in their bodies, they even have no reaction when they are injured. They are directly hitting an axe, as if they were their own body. Just a piece of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to run into this kind of enemy, they are not mad, they are war machines without feelings and without consciousness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of first-class warriors on the hundreds of Eagles, several offensive and defensive, each fell more than 30 people, and then the morale of the Eagle Knight collapsed Into the mud of the Richards army, and even began to show signs of retreat. They have successively encountered three tough fronts of flying blades, barriers and humanoid warriors. Every time they were strongly attacked, morale finally came again and again, and then three and three. The humanoid early stage fighters were indifferent to the fall of their comrades around, and they even had a few knives in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest difference between the nesting combat unit and the human warrior. In the fierce battle, the nesting combat unit will fight to the end even if all teammates fall down in an instant. If the human army quickly dies and does not collapse, it is a soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer front is temporarily stuck in the glue, and Odom is alone in the depths of the Richards, and forgetting to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-headed hammer is waving like a wind, and every time it falls, it will bring a flesh and blood. Odom is full of blood and thick temperament, and has done his best. But the results were not as brilliant as Odom originally expected, the enemy did not collapse, there was no collapse, and there were not even many casualties. Most of Odom's attacks were taken up by Gangde and the Ogre, but other enemies were like wolves, constantly looking for opportunities to pounce on them and licking a piece of meat on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ogre and Gangde did not know how many times they were heavily bombarded by Odom. Their blockade can only block half of Odom's attacks. The remaining offensives can only be hardened by the body. However, the glory of the glory continues to shine in them, and all the wounds are healing at a speed visible to the naked eye. Just retreat for a moment, and in the blink of an eye can appear in front of Odom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Odom feels that his body is starting to get heavy, the magic effect on his body has long been dispelled, not only that, the red hair opposite The girl also added a lot of negative spells to him. Although the negative effects are weakened a lot under the sacred temperament, the negative state that has been preserved has already made Odom a headache. The power of the young girl who casts the curse is even stronger than the so-called big magician he brought. Otherwise, some of the negative effects will not take effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the young female pastor next to me, no, the amount of magicalism she has released has reached the level of the great gods, but there is no sign of divine power! Without her endless healing and powerful treatment, Odom had already smashed Gangde and the ogre. Is the book in her hand an artifact? Why is there a magical spell cast out every time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wielding the hammer and retreating Gangde, Odom finally couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. The air inhaled into the lungs was full of bloody suffocation. At this pause, Odom suddenly felt that the lower back was a pain! He snarled and saw a smashing arrow on his back. A warrior is holding a magic cockroach. After hitting it, he is not in love, and is quickly retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their tactical focus, except for the ogre and Gangde, others are not sneak attacks or auxiliary attacks, self-protection-based, one-touch away I didn’t face Odom at all, and let Odom’s attempts to kill the legal person several times failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard has already deployed the external human first-level fighters. A total of five fully armed early-stage fighters easily killed the obstructed light cavalry, and then surrounded Odom's heavy cavalry, and then let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the air is a piece of sacred radiance, this time on the Knights of Odom. Shining Iowa has already blessed the magical effect for his own fighters. It seems that there is nothing to do at the moment, and actually began to dispel the gain magic of the enemy. At this moment, he is just as shining as the god on the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of Richard couldn’t help but slammed up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Odom's cavalry, a great magician appeared to be extremely flustered, and the magic spells were wrong several times. He finally chose the direction of escape, began to prepare for the application of acid mist, and wanted to open a path for his escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha face sinking, set the war horse, and began to recite the spell. On the battlefield, Richard rarely uses magic that requires spells, but it is now special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fireball on the left hand of Richard, but it was much larger than the ordinary fireball. Then the fate of the twins flashed a layer of red light. Increased again by half! This is a fireball with two magic level upgrades, spells, and spells. The power has reached the limit of six levels of magic. It is not far from the bursting fireball of the seventh level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge fireball with a diameter of more than half a meter whizzes out, spanning a hundred meters, and shoots at the great magician who wants to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sorcerer screams and instantly inspires multiple magic shields! After the rolling fire, he fell from the horse immediately, and the knights who were involved in the magic attack range were mostly killed, but he himself saved a life under the magic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
