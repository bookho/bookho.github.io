			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courtier and graceful court courtier immediately bent down deeply. The look is respectful and solemn, saying: "It’s the fault of the chair! This is going to give you a new one! As for this daring and small thing, the minister will punish it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe waved a big hand and said, "No need! Eat tight, talk after dinner!" He picked up a special high-legged 'cup' with an ice bucket size, which would be quite In a bottle and a half of the aperitif, all poured into the mouth, and then the left hand waved again, the whole eight piles of high pre-dinner snacks disappeared into the bottomless mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids immediately sneaked up, quickly and quickly removed the empty dish, and then sent a main course. From the point of view of quickness, they have at least a level of 4 or 5 ranger or assassin. The table that can present ten main dishes at the same time seems to be very large, but it looks very ordinary in front of the emperor. When the maids unveiled the lids of the silver plates one by one, the main dishes were filled with large ribs all over the blood. I don’t know what the meat of Warcraft is, and it has served here for more than three years. The maid could not fully recognize every kind of meat. Although the edges of the plate are carefully outlined by flowers and sauces, the ribs themselves are almost all-life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the emperor’s favorite, half-cooked roast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips eyes are bright, he grabs a rib and throws it into the air, and the strange bird flies down and grabs the ribs, bringing it back I used my own shelf to eat. The emperor himself began to destroy a piece of bloody meat weighing one kilogram in weight at an alarming rate. However, when he was eating, he was very quiet, and he could hardly hear any chewing sound. This is the place where the emperor's table etiquette is closest to the aristocratic style. As for the thick and hard bones in the ribs, like the flesh, they disappeared silently in the throat of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other court near the minister cleared the scorpion and began to tell the past day in a singing voice, mainly the important event that occurred when the emperor slept at night: "The Grey Dwarf And the orc coalition sneaked into the Fort Thord, staying up late, they were of course repelled... Your direct territory Manro plane just completed the first tax this year, the total amount of taxes is XXXOOO... The Archimonde family last night A family-wide trial was held..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Philippe swallowed the mouthful of the meat and said, "You just Is it that Gordon killed his son Wolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Philippe rarely stopped the knife and fork, thought about it, said: "It seems that Richard is a bit interesting, Gordon wants to be his heir. What do you know about this Richard?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His teacher is Su Hailun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Soon, the emperor put a chewed meat are not sprayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court near the minister was also shocked, but he waved his hand immediately, the maids swarmed up, packed up a messy table, and ordered the kitchen to take the main dish again. Prepare ten copies, and then grab the Philip behind him and force the emperor to recite his back. This momentary reaction is full of his strength in this position in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe coughed a few times and spit out half of the bones that had not chewed, only to gasp and ask: "Which Su Hailun..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court minister replied cautiously: "It is the guardian of the alliance, you personally booked..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s face is cloudy and uncertain, asks: "She recently Is there any movement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of the legendary mage is naturally the most important level to be valued, so the court minister immediately replied: "I heard that His Highness Su Hailun is often in the position recently. In the depths of the expedition, I haven’t returned to the deep blue for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s face is so good that he rarely stops eating and looks at the table. Ribs, some slyly said: "Hey, this woman.... When she came to the door, she was going to compare with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, the victory is great!" said the court near the court. This is not a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor snorted and said for a long time: "It’s just a small win.... No, it’s a victory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Can force the legendary Master, you are a great monarch!" The court minister ignored the emperor's tone and continued to praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was just a good luck. If she is looking for a door now, the outcome will be impossible. Never look down on a legend, even if it is a meal." !" The emperor reprimanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! Of course!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor waved his hand and said, "Let's do it. After a while, you will prepare a ton of ribs and give it to Richard in my name. It is to give him a meal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One ton of dragon ribs!" The court near the court exaggeratedly took a breath, euphemistically expressed opposition: "Yes Not too much, how can he eat it? And the amount of dragon ribs in your kitchen is less than one hundred tons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips does not Responsively wave a big hand: "According to what I said! Appetite determines the power! Can the little guy who can see Su Hailun not even eat this thing? But the kitchen inventory is really not much... So, first think of a way Go buy, and let General Momo take the person to hunt a few dragons, not green dragons, the meat of that thing is sour! He knows my taste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Philip thought again, and on the other side, the older, decent financial deputy minister said: "Look to my warehouse to find out what can be self-defense. Magic protective gear, give two pieces together with the dragon ribs to Richard! Not too good, enough to show my attitude, after all, Gordon can be regarded as the royal party. We can not let his new heir in the floating world There is no cost to the accident, or the idiots after the accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the Fokker thing?" Inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the old guys in the parliament, let us not let Joseph and Archimonde play!" After that, Philip continued to deal with him. Breakfast. The second round of the main course has been completed, still a half-cooked barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trial, Richard found that people looked at his eyes changed, envy and jealousy, almost no direct hostility and disdain. When meeting on the road, the number of people who greeted the call increased significantly, and the attitude was more respectful than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Richard has a magic lab dedicated to him, where he can draw magical structures or perform some sub-level magic experiments. There are also two assistants in the lab and three trousers. At the same time, Gordon also gave Richard four young and powerful war knights for Richard's research to transform the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
