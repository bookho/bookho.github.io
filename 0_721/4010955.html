			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of such insults are enough to provoke a scene on this occasion. The duel is inconsistent with the profound and long-standing inheritance of the Jagged family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the big man is just frowning, obviously the heart is hard to decide, subconsciously ignore the young man's sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the white night suddenly said lazily: "It’s no big deal for Richard’s legends, that is, the number is a little more. But who are you and Ake? When Mond goes to war, anyone will fight. Don't count me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement, except for Agamemnon, everyone in the room shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Family is more than one legend, and White Night is one of the youngest. But when the white night finally couldn't hold back the power of the legendary mark, the force immediately rushed to the 23rd level in just a few months, and awakened several powerful bloodlines. Now, in terms of combat power, even the Iron Man is not much stronger than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is consciously full of enthusiasm, because there is no super strong in the family, but there is only a weaker than the super strong, and the white night. If the white night is not willing to do it, then there is no need to fight this battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man was shocked and asked: "White night, you...what are you doing?" Faced with the white night known for his fierce name, he does not Dare to talk like Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night is still lazy and said: "Because Richard said that it is correct, there is no need for the iron to do it for the idiot of Sisby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man was shocked and angry and said, "Sisibi is your uncle, how can you do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;White night said faintly: "He is also your uncle. I think if you are fighting, you can find out which legendary strongman Archimonde is singled out and revenge for Sisby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! How could I be singled out with the legend..." The young man was so angry that he couldn’t speak. He is just an ordinary sanctuary, and any legend can slap him to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can't do it, then get out of it, don't scream here." White night seems to have lost patience, and speaking is not welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man was frightened and intertwined, shy and angry, and could only turn his complaint to the bloody grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Holy Alliance, White Night has always been regarded as the second undecided Queen, she is extremely heavy, and she has always been unscrupulous. If it really angered her, although the two are brothers and sisters, but the white nights have always hated him, it is very likely to kill him on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in front of the Iron Man, the White Night will never be scrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is also an ancient tradition of blood marriage in the Jagged family. The young man wanted to marry the white night in order to covet the white night and the nightmare. The taboo of the white night. From then on, in the heart of the white night, he was regarded as a person who could kill at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" The iron-clad tyrant screamed. His chest was sharply ups and downs, apparently mad, saying to Agamemnon: "You are my heir now, talk about your thoughts. Speak a few more words!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Agamemnon said: "The mistake is in Sisby, not Richard. In addition, if you don't win, you can't beat it. The legend is no longer, and there are not so many people who see the money together. Don't forget, Archimonde has a point redemption system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon has said so much. What he said does not say other people, that is, the iron-blooded grandfather listened to it and was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of the legendary powers will be weak, and on the road to achievement legend, they have already exercised a firm will. Maybe there is a certain person who will see the money, but Richard will have more than four legends next time. How can all of them see the money? They follow Richard, and apart from Archimonde's ability to give them some unreachable benefits elsewhere, the identification of Richard himself must be an important reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Archimonde’s point redemption system is also a big killer, which does not create massive wealth every moment. However, this is the only way to get the super fifth-order costume, and the attraction to many powerful people is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Iron Man is still somewhat unwilling, looking at the White Night again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Night finally moved, and looked at it with a near-no-small pair of eyes and a big man, saying: "Agamemnon is right, even if I go all out, we can't win."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence once again shocked the audience, even the Iron Man is a bit stunned: "How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night Showing a smile-like expression, said: "What Li Chafan is doing is basically sure. He dares to disclose the news of Su Hailun's disappearance, dare to openly attack the ancient principles of protecting the lord, on the one hand, naturally It is a determination to show the revenge for Su Hailun. On the other hand, hehe, is he really crazy, not confident to win all those who dare to interfere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Iron Man is still unbelievable: "But, isn't he equal to challenging the entire Holy Alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not? Father, you don't want to admit, Just because Richard is too young, it rises too fast. Our iron family does have a millennium calendar. It’s a deep foundation, and Richard’s rise has been more than a decade, and it’s been more than a decade since Count Gordon’s. But history doesn’t mean it’s strong. Now the real enemy in Richard’s eyes is probably in the palace. The one who is down, not us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man is sitting back in the seat and saying, "I understand. I am really old.. ...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she first entered the legend, she met her veteran legend more than once, and put a so-called predecessor’s shelf in front of her, refused to give her the proper Respect. For such people, the white night has always been answered with a fist. After seriously injuring two unopened old legends, no one will provoke her for no reason at all in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is unfortunate that the Jagged family has become a stepping stone for Richard Li, although Richard is not willing to do so. However, the stupidity of Sisby has pushed the iron and blood to such an awkward situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Man is also a person who can be broken. After the knot is solved, he made a decision: "Go to the people of the Sisby family, this matter is So far, I will not continue to pursue it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the room have a heavy expression, although the iron words seem to be very tough, but in fact it is already Richard took the soft and gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the entire Holy Alliance, and even the entire Noland, boiled again, the reason is the statement of the great blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is as strong as the Duke of Iron, is it soft in front of the strength of Archimonde? All the nobles who heard this news were extremely shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Richard’s public display of force in the dark blue, everything he did was shocking and ignorant of any tradition or unspoken rules. Su Hailun’s death, or disappearance, has completely angered Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beast has begun to show the claws that have been hidden! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disguised bow of the big man did not provoke any waves in Richard’s heart. When the news spread, he was standing in the dark blue, listening to Phil’s report. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of magic paper has been identified, it is the magic paper dedicated to the Holy League royal family, the process is specially designed, and other places can not be counterfeited. The reason why Richard has not seen it before, because it is a private stationery that is only available to the Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a dozen of the creatures on paper have been identified. They are all life that emerges in places where the power of chaos in the void is prevalent. The areas covered by the eternal and the dragon's rays of light are all places of order, so these lives are extremely rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil adjusts the magic image and brings up one of the sketches on the magic paper. It was a strange creature that was big and small, like a stone element, and then said, "His Royal Highness, I think the key may be on this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Look at the light and condense: "Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil said: "I found all the ancient sacred, and finally in a legend about the ancient race. I found the origin of it. The name of this thing is Shi Nan, a strange form of life between flesh and blood and elemental creatures. In its body, order and chaos are integrated, thus generating strange power. However, its requirements for the living environment are extremely demanding, and it must be a world in which the chaos and order are absolutely balanced, so it is extremely rare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tightly locked, everything on the magic paper has been deeply imprinted on his mind. At this moment, he does not have to look at it. He can also remember the dozens of hand-painted creatures on the whole magic paper. Only this stone man is somewhat fuzzy. Traces that have been constantly touched. It seems that Phil has also noticed this detail, so he focused on investigating the information of this stone man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
