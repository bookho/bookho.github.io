			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man has entered the scope of the Dragon City, which means Every dragon can hit him! Does he know what kind of situation he is, and is he still standing there so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dragons are stupid and yelling, even Tiamat also quietly opened his eyes. But when it struggled, it fell back to the ground and continued to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil dragon has long been able to touch the rules and control the part, it is the power beyond the ordinary dragon to make it feel a strange dangerous feeling. Tiamat decided not to take risks anymore. Since he experienced the desperation of dying in the hands of Su Helen, his heart soaring in the sky has faded a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the Dragon City area, playing with the blue sè soul scroll in his hand. The dragons are able to see what they are, and he is naturally very clear. This scroll is the tool that Su Hailun left for him to control the numerous dragons in the Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the legendary Master has already arranged everything, and as soon as Richard enters the semi-position, the control will be automatically transferred to him. The triggering condition is also very simple. When Su Helun loses contact with the soul of this half-plane, then the handover procedure will start. When Su Hailun helped Richard to build a half-plane, he probably started to arrange it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul scroll, more verified the speculation in Richard's heart, Su Hailun had an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is completely unimaginable, what happened to Su Hailun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage itself is even more terrifying than the current Richard, and it is impossible to break her defense with an indefinite attack. And with a deep blue sigh, the magic furnace array she will never have to worry about the lack of magic, so that a powerful enemy will also be hated under the call of her endless dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Helun is the real master of space, she can zì yóu shuttle in any space, even the abyss hell is coming and going. She is the most powerful superpower to be trapped. How could it happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard also knows that the so-called power is only relative. In the depths of the plane, I don't know how many dangerous places there are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is immortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Richard just sighed and looked up at the dense dragon in the Dragon City, holding the soul of the slave in his hands and said: "Control you The contract is here, who is going to take it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is very calm, his expression is very calm, and even the action that inspires magical vindictiveness is not. But the more he does, the more uneasy the dragons are. They still remember the kind of destructive atmosphere that came out when Richard fired a blue fire! What they can rely on now is that Richard is in the range of the Dragon City, and they can be surrounded by siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;siege? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dragons suddenly had a sudden heart. Real powerhouses, such as Su Hailun, are never afraid of siege! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dragon living next to Tiamat suddenly remembered something and turned to look at the dragon's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But see the hole is empty and deep, how can there be the shadow of evil dragons? It apparently hid in the deepest part of the nest. And the voice is constantly coming from its lair, as if it is a very sleepy look. But when is this all the time, the evil dragon can still sleep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black dragon has lived for thousands of years and has long since crossed the legendary mark, and naturally it is also smart. It immediately understood what it was, and then recalled the blue flame that Richard had just ignited, and suddenly it was a chill. Then he said nothing, quickly retracted his nest, and in a twinkling of an eye, he made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons that can be shut down to Dragon City by Su Hailun are very smart. Not so smart, I died early and died. In addition to Tiamat, it is the most powerful of the millennium black dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the two most powerful dragons are shrinking, the remaining dragons certainly know what to do. Most of them immediately retracted their nests and learned to sleep like Tiamat. And a few more shameless points flew to the side of Richard, screaming at the ground, constantly shaking his tail, to please the new owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not bother to pay attention to the few charming dragons. Seeing that no dragon dared to resist himself, he opened the soul control scroll and activated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of a group of blue sè into the eyebrow of Richard, immediately added a spell in his consciousness, which is used to establish a direction Dragon City's portal, which can then be used to transfer the dragons in the Dragon City to designated locations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is Su Hailun’s legendary magic dragon call. However, Su Hailun also has the talent to summon the master, but Richard does not have the bonus of this talent, so if you want to summon the magic dragon, it will be two ends at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and continued to examine the entire half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While entering the palace, a reel was also ejected from the void, which recorded the method of activating the jīng coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jīng spirits are not strong, but all have the wisdom of the higher spirits, and are the most outstanding works of the jīng. With these dozens of jīng coffins, Richard does not have to spend more time managing this half-planet. What he wants, the jīng spirits will naturally handle it for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace is a private treasure house of Su Helun, even if it is Richard’s current wealth, it is a bit shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the treasure house, there are as many as five pieces of material that can be used to make the core of the Midarene battle version, and even a large lord-level material! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the core of a virtual dragon, sealed by a magical array. Even so, you can see that countless symbols of the gods form a strip of light, which is worn in and out of the core, so you can imagine how powerful it is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard first saw it, he almost stopped. The light bands made up of gods are not just beautiful decorations, it is the realization of the power of rules! Seeing these bands is almost equivalent to reading the rules directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the core of the Void Beast and quietly read the rules on the light belt. But he stood for an entire hour, and the rules that flowed from the front were still not duplicated, and even did not allow Richard to establish a complete analysis system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard knows that this rule is very high-end and complex, and I am afraid that it will take a lot of time to reach the initial establishment of an analytical model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily put down the core of the Void Beast and turned to look at other things in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun seems to have the same hobby as the dragon. She especially likes to collect some crystals and ores containing powerful energy. Naturally, they all have beautiful sè and 璀璨The light. Many of them are not named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These rare materials account for about two-thirds of the warehouse. In the last two, Su Hailun’s equipment was not used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of equipment in the arsenal is varied, and there are all kinds of occupations, all of which are jīng products. Li Chaguang has seen more than a dozen pieces of legendary equipment. There are countless legendary levels, and even three artifacts. Although it is only an artifact waiting for the first time, it is shocking enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But relatively speaking, the proportion of equipment in Su Hailun’s collection is very low. This is also related to her fighting habits. The legendary mage has a powerful body that can crush the dragon. It is really hard to beat hard when the battle is fierce, and the damage rate of the equipment is very high. So over time, some of the legendary mages of the little miser are gradually getting rid of the dependence on equipment, and more rely on their own strength to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most interesting thing for Richard is the private library built by Su Hailun. The library uses space technology, and the interior space is much larger than the exterior looks. It is a square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library is not an ordinary layout, but hundreds of stone platforms are placed on it, and a magic book of various styles floats on the stone platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little reluctant to say that some of them are slate, some are metal plates, and some even simply a light, directly showing the power of regular power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone slabs are mostly empty, and there are fewer than a hundred books in the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer of magic protection on the outside of each book. To crack the rules of protection, you can see the book inside. According to the original design, this is the mechanism set up to protect the reader. If you can't break the rules that make up the magic shield, it means you can't reach the minimum requirements for reading the books inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
