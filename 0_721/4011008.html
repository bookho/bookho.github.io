			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the moment, the Goshawk and Asa’s enemies have become Solomon's scholars, a group of madmen who are also known for their power to control destiny. They may not be very strong, but they must not be ignored. Any change in the environment can become the sharpest weapon in the hands of scholars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goshawk is indulged, born in a scholarly mage, and he also reached the level of the university, naturally clear but the opponent's hardship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa did not bother him, let the goshawk think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Goshawk suddenly smiled and said, "Do you have a lot of savings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you mean by those broken bones? There are quite a lot of them. There are mines, they are all mine. Do you want to use them? I heard that those things are worth the money in Noland, but I didn't watch them." There is something special about them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to your tribe, I will pick something. Then we will go to the treasure house of the temple. Look, there may be something I need. Oh, don't we go to the treasure house of the temple to take things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you don't move the saint totem and the blood of the beast "Others take it casually."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godhawk said: "But I just need the blood of the beast, but as long as a drop is fine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa thought for a moment and said with some uncertainty: "If it is just a drop, it should be a small problem. After all, the blood of the beast is still full of tanks! As long as the elders are Big sacrifice If you have one of the consents, you can go and get it. But what do we want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk smiled and said: "I heard that Richard got it. The point redemption system is very interesting. We are still idle and idle, but it’s a lively event. The things I collect are for redemption. But I don’t have to worry too much. I have a list here. There are a few things to collect, they are scattered throughout Carando, we look for it separately. Come back later in a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa took over the list Looked at it and took a handful of strokes. I put the most difficult ones on the list and said: "I will find them, and the rest will be yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk took the list and immediately looked at it, leaving less than a quarter of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to do this! I am already very good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asa looked disdainful: "Where can I be stunned by the guy who stunned me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk looked awkward, but this is He was injured in his life and was destined to be poked by Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two know that there is not much time, especially Asa, to run more than half of the continent of Caledon in a week. After a while, the Goshawk and Asa set off and went in one direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned to his floating island, he accidentally saw the turbidity waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately went to the turbidity and asked: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flow smiled and handed over a list: "This is the contribution share of this month's extant battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contribution share? Does this require you to come in person? Just send someone to come over and you can. And I haven’t already paid it on time?” Richard said, taking the receipt and only glanced at it. Immediately, his eyebrows were slightly wrinkled: “What happened, suddenly improved three. What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undecided to decide to launch a full-scale offensive in the dusk, to drive out the Dakso Das The domain battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news almost shocked Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland has always been at a disadvantage in the land of dusk, which is the result of the common maintenance of the three great empire. Noland is almost everywhere, and it is difficult to increase the investment in the dusk. The contribution share is a compromise. Those big aristocrats who are unwilling to participate or temporarily unable to support the absolute battlefield need to pay special taxes and fees to hire free powers to fight in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period of official separation from the Holy Alliance, these contributions have never been stopped. Because the field battlefield is actually a place that affects the interests of the entire Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that the contribution share has suddenly increased, it means that the Holy Alliance really has to make a big move in the absolute battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with the terrible strength of Philip in the past, it did not put too much on a place where the sun was born. Now how can you suddenly have such a big ambition, ready to sweep the entire dusk? How can it be possible only by the power of the Holy Alliance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Su Hailun comes back, plus Richard, it is absolutely impossible. It is only possible to add Philip and Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Richard’s inquiry, he laughed and did not answer, saying only that it was a military secret. When it comes to action, Richard will naturally know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is slightly mysteriously close to Richard, whispering: "The meaning of the undecided squat is that you want to go to a fierce battlefield. Even if only Look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If nothing else, the turbidity will not be said anyway. Richard was puzzled in his heart, but he also understood that this must be an extremely important matter. Otherwise, I am sure that he is fighting the reaper, and certainly will not take any boring things to occupy his time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "That's good. Please inform me in advance when you are in action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The turbidity flow is deep, saying: "I look forward to your arrival!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called a waiter to let him go with a turbidity The storehouse took the sacrifices of the contribution share and walked to the study. Before returning to Faro, he had to spend half an hour to process all the backlog of family affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study desk, there is an envelope with the highest level of importance and the highest level of emergency. Richard's eyebrows are raised, and documents like this are not common. He immediately opened the envelope and glanced at the contents of the document, his face changed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a claim for a reward. The intelligence content is to report the identity and whereabouts of a scholar's mage, and the content has passed the initial confirmation of Ellie. In fact, Richard, who has been dealing with the Master of Scholars for a long time, just glanced at the contents of the information listed, and it can be concluded that this is indeed a scholar's mage, and it is quite high-order, at least several levels stronger than Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that this scholar's mage is the Goshawk, the prince of the Millennium Empire, and the father of the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this information, Richard walked back and forth in the study, hesitating. Time is extremely precious, he actually went back and forth for ten minutes or could not make up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard called the old housekeeper and handed the document to him, saying: "The bounty is still going on, but telling Sauron and Ellie. Hey, let them pay attention to the person who gave us this information, and keep him in the air!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, and Richard said to the old housekeeper: How about cocoa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler said: "She has been in a bad mood recently, it should be because of family matters. In addition, the child is not around. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "The child needs to check further and let her feel at ease. In addition, now the child has it, she is ready to choose, is staying , or what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler said: "She wants to stay. Of course, this still requires your final decision."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Richard a little surprised and said, "Does she know that if she stays, she will give up the territory and the title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"know "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked aside and said, "Let her stay. The title and territory are still reserved for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for Your Highness!" The old butler was grateful for this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is another thing, Miss Ms. Mei is preparing to marry Agamemnon of the Jagged family, but she still has an old obligation not completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard has waved his hand very simply: "obligation exemption!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But.. .... But..." The old butler was somewhat unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient obligation of Archimonde has never been an exception for many years, and the violators are all severely punished. Richard’s disposition of Vinica is a light sentence. It is. In theory, only family marriage can exempt the obligation, but Agamemnon is not a patriarch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them send the second child to Archimonde. I am going to fight the Reaper now, and I don't have time to attend their wedding. Help me prepare a gift and send it to the past."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confessing something, Richard left the floating island and returned to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting out of the transmission array, the sound of the mother's nest will sound: "Master, you'd better come to a turbulent place, there will be surprises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to say! I don't want to spend a day on the road." After Richard was promoted to the super strong, the speed of making the structure was greatly improved, and the success rate was even more Raised to the point of incredible. Every three days he can make a normal fifth-order structure. Therefore, it is the most difficult thing for Richard to tolerate when he spends his time on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't take you a day, it only takes a few minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Richard understood the meaning of the hen's nest, and in his temporary palace, there was a device similar to a portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significantly different from the general portal, the dark brown cortex of the portal frame, and the constant undulations that indicate it is a creature. A life that can build a transmission channel through your body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never heard of a similar life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the hen’s nest is ringing again: “Through this portal, you can reach the turbulent land. Of course, the transfer requires a small fee. About 300,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is the most precious for Richard, and money is not important. So he readily entered this strange portal. After a familiar space transformation feeling, Richard found himself in a turbulent place. The body of the front nest is like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked back at the portal and greatly praised: "It’s good! Is this made by you? Very good, build one on every battlefield. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called wormhole. But the cost of sending it through it is very high, I don't think this is a suitable idea."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
