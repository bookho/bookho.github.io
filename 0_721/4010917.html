If you cancel your order, it will be a heavy blow to our credibility. It will also offend many people who should not be offended. Richard, what happened?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s anxiety is too obvious, it’s written on his face. He hesitated and said, "Yes, I always feel that something bad will happen soon. So I need to maximize my military strength in the shortest possible time. Have you heard of the Reaper?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reaper!" Nolan exclaimed, "How can you get the reaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in the most important plane, Faro, found the end of the rì mark. So, I think I will have to give them a sigh soon."<br /><br />&nbsp Nolan forced himself to calm down and said, "I understand. Tomorrow I will personally apologize to the big customers, all the equipment that has been prepared will be delivered. Then our workshop will take up the production capacity." , do your best to make the equipment on your design."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Lan smiled and said: "Our fate has long been tied together, and it has helped me. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitated for a moment, Lan Cai said: "From the past experience, the most sensible thing is to give up the plane where the end of the rì mark, cut off all the connections with them. Anyway, it will not take long, the reaper will completely destroy it. Why are you not so Do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I feel that I have to play with them once and then consider giving up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "War with the Reaper is a waste of valuable military power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will consider it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan nodded and said, "You have to be careful. One plane is no big deal. You can buy a few more back at most."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Richard gave Nolan a smile and then cut off the newsletter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard sent it to his own half-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment his half-plane has grown to a few hundred meters, and the energy-absorbing trees thrive, taking energy from the empty energy storm all the time. And then continuously converted into land masses, allowing the semi-position to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current half-plane is still bare, and the top is the loess gravel, which is completely a barren land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked on the semi-level surface and suddenly leaned over and grabbed a handful of earth and stone from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil is deep yellow sè, extraordinarily delicate, so small that you can subdivide infinitely with a little hand. The stones in the soil are big but the size of the thumb, and the small one is like a sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked out a stone and pinched it with his hand, and the loess on the surface fell down, revealing the crystal yellow sè crystal below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unremarkable stone, after being rubbed a few times, turned into a crystal clear crystal, which can see the thick yellow flow Soil energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone turned out to be a highly pure earth element crystal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a piece of land to get Nolan, you can sell a lot of money. The loess, which is the pure elemental soil, is one of the most widely used elemental materials and can be used in a large number of potions, arrays and equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha actually throws the crystal of the earth directly on the ground and then walks to a soil platform at the edge. At his feet, all the soil is the earth of elements, and all the stones are elemental crystals. I really don't need to care too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tutai zhōng yāng is a magic pool, divided into three layers, which are arranged in a stepped shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topmost pool is about one meter square, and it is already full at the moment. The pool overflows along the well-opened passage and flows into the next layer of magic pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of magic pool is much larger, one meter wide and four meters long. The second layer of magic pool has just filled a small amount of water, and it will take a while to get full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third layer is divided into several small pools, these are element pools. After the second layer of magic pool is filled with water, it will be injected into these small pools. Each small pool corresponds to a different element, and the future savings here is the magic with the corresponding genus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the topmost magic pool, the bottom of the pool has been covered with a thick layer of magic crystal, which is also mixed with a lot of high-purity magic crystal. Seeing these magic crystals, Richard can't help but swear. How long is this? But the magic crystal that he has accumulated for him in the half plane has already exceeded one million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy tree is one of the rarest treasures between the faces. Su Hailun was able to give dozens of Richards at a time, and it was indeed a bloody one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ordinary legendary mage can get one, it will be willing to go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated for a moment, or went to the magic pool to get the magic crystals out. He is in desperate need of money to expand the army, so that the enormous wealth created by drawing the structure is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this magic crystal, it is enough for Nolan to pay for the damages caused by the breach of contract. As for the magical equipment that can equip the entire legion, you can pay for the sacrifices if you have time later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After patrolling his little territory, Richard once again strengthened the transmission plane of the half-plane and returned to Noland. He installed the magic crystal and let a team of knights give it to Nolan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing this, Richard just wanted to see Coco again. Suddenly a waiter flew and said: "His Royal Highness, Soram The Duke’s messenger arrived.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Soul’s Messenger?” Richard’s face was a bit weird, and he didn’t expect Soram to actually send someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to say that Soram was also a duke, so Richard met the messenger in the more formal hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger is a young aristocrat, and the silver sè of the neckline indicates that he is a hereditary Viscount. As a messenger, this title combined with his age is not rude to make an envoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Richard, the young messenger did not fear, and talked awkwardly: "His Royal Highness, I was commissioned by the Duke of Soram, for Minnie. You must be very clear that Minnie is the wife of Master Stevenson. On the way back to the territory, she brutally killed her husband. Now, there is solid evidence that she has escaped to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the messenger paused a little and looked at Richard. As long as Richard denied it, he would put the testimony of the witnesses that had been prepared long ago, and then overwhelm Richard with the squally momentum! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard just said faintly: "What about that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young messenger for a while The sharp rhetoric prepared all over the place fell into the air. He didn't think that Richard actually admitted that there was such a thing, and this made his brain completely confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soram and Richard do have contradictions, but that is a dispute between the two lords, with fixed rules of the game. However, Minnie's actions are to challenge the traditional bottom line of the nobility. In this case, if Richard is sheltering and accepting Minnie, he will face the accusations of the nobles unless he does not value his decent and reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger thought about all the possible scenarios and designed the response, but did not expect that Richard was not prepared to play according to the traditional rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and jumped straight to the next step: "Since you admit that Minnie is here, please give her to me, I can Make sure she will be judged in the most fair trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can guarantee? What are you supposed to do, and why?" Richard sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young aristocratic face immediately swelled red, loudly: "I am Viscount Wei. Wei Yang! My uncle is the Duke of Wei Yang, the current sacred dynasty south The general commander of the legion! Wei Yang’s name is enough to guarantee?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said: “I just beat your Northern Army The Southern Army has come out? I am very surprised, why didn't Soram come by himself, but I want to send you? He must know that the messengers sent to me have nothing to end, aren't they?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tok stayed, his face became difficult to look at. Obviously he also found that the task was not simple. There seems to be another story between Soram and Richard. The contradiction is not only a few times, but it is so simple to compete for each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toke’s heart hates, but the momentum does not fall, Yang said: “His Royal Highness, you better hand over Minnie, this is in line with your identity. Otherwise, if you spread it out, I am afraid that your reputation is not very good! As for your provocation to the Southern Legion of the Dynasty, you can rest assured that I will pass it on for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie put away a smile and said: "Our Archimonde's reputation seems to have been not very good, or else, how can any of the stray wild dogs dare to pounce on a bite? You Despite spreading the matter, the killer who killed Stravinson now lives in the Black Rose Castle. If Soram is dissatisfied, he can try it. Just take down the castle, Minnie. Nature is his! If you don't have this skill, let him give me the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toke sneered, nodded and said, "Very good. !His Royal Highness, you can rest assured that I will bring you these words! In addition, our Weiyang family will respond at the appropriate time. Provocation ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Trafigura sentence not finished, suddenly snapped, his face has endured a slap in the face! The slap in the face was extremely heavy, and he flew up the whole person, turned several laps in the air, and then fell heavily on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slap in the face is Richard, but he is sitting on the high platform, as if he has not moved. No one in the entire Chamber saw how he shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards brought by Tok rushed to help him up, and several other guards took out their swords and stared at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee's face is as calm as water, just raise your left hand and gently press down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights on both sides of the Chamber of Defence screamed and screamed, and rushed to the guards who dared to pull the knife in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two guards left by Toke, and the two men still have a life because they have to help him without a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
