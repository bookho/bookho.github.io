			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real vision is not a unique talent. Well, my dear Richard, in your body, what really works now is the big lord. The heart. And your soul is the sum of hundreds of millions of subtle souls... Ah! This is really fascinating, it can be called a great thing! I am more convinced that you are qualified to go with me. Exploring the new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the New World?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon did not answer Richard's The question, but asked again: "Lee, you thought about it, what is the ultimate meaning of life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question that has no answer at all. Richard seriously thought about it, but he could not find an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More powerful? Longer life? Still more experience and experience? It doesn't seem to be, or more than that. Solomon smiled and said: "The ultimate goal of life is evolution. But our evolution has an end. Your current strength is already qualified and me." Exploring this issue. I think you have discovered that in this world, there is a limit to strength. How can we be talented, how to work hard, and we can't reach the limit and achieve perfection in the true sense. This is the rule limit of the world. For people like us, the rules of the world are not the power that can be used, but the shackles of ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei has to admit that Solomon That's true. Richard did not discover this until he began to control the underlying rules of the world. In this sense, Solomon did indeed walk in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon opened his arms and said, "This world does not welcome us like this. She is even committed to destroying us! When I came to the world, I stole it." After the Reaper privilege, I finally verified my constant conjecture.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Reaper, the world’s rule for all the final dinners that are ready for the peak race.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any plane, any race, when they begin to control the rules of the bottom of the world, is actually a death knell for themselves! Whenever a peak race is cleared, It is the end of an era. You and I are from Noland, who is currently in the seventh era. Before us, when the ancient star family still existed, it was the sixth era. When the star family reached its peak, it attracted The real reaper of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then your purpose is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to explore the world's ultimate with the dark side of the world! Finally, I want to break The embarrassment of the whole world, at that time, was the beginning of a new life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently, momentarily said: "Faro's reaper seems to It’s not hard to deal with. Are they really as powerful as you said?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon laughed and said, “Faro’s reaper is sent by me to play with you. You see, I strictly abide by the rules of the game and only send a mother ship in accordance with the level of that plane. Of course, if you can destroy the mother ship, it is beyond my expectation. Because of this, I confirmed. You have the strength and qualifications attached to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you admit that the reaper of Faro is what you sent!" Breath, the hand shines a little dazzling blue light again. That is the sign that the flame of the Star of Destruction is advanced again, and it is also a precursor to the release of the deep blue sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! You...what are you doing...no!!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the screams that Solomon once again became less elegant, the sigh of dark blue has been shot on Solomon's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, almost everything is dyed with a layer of blue, then crystallized, broken down into countless crystal sand, rolling and falling. In the twinkling of an eye, there is an empty space in the hall, leaving only a pile of crystal sand on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of deep blue sigh is too great, but everything that is affected by it, except for the top artifacts, will be crystallized and turned into crystal sand . However, it is still not as good as the light of annihilation. The light of annihilation is to truly wipe the material directly into nothingness. The great power of the light of annihilation lies in the horror energy that is released from the turn of matter to nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all over... Richard sighs in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scholar's mage, very difficult to be found before being traced, but in the frontal battle, it is often vulnerable. This is the choice of the road, and there is no high score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the rule of control, from the world of exploration, to the evolution of life, Solomon is far behind Richard. Two people look at the world's perspective, not at the same level. Perhaps Richard has indeed reached the level of invincibility in this world, but compared with Solomon, it is like a beast that only knows muscles and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, everything is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Richard will also follow the same path as Solomon, but that is the future. Even if he finally agreed with Solomon's idea, at this moment, Richard would also destroy everything and kill him. This is not only the hatred of Richard himself, but also the desire of Faro billion souls. They shared their power with Richard, and Richard took responsibility accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, is it really over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s mind suddenly moved and instinctively felt like he was missing something. The scholars' methods are different and they think they are dead, but they actually escape in some way. This is not the first time. Richard immediately turned on the real vision and scanned the ruins, but he found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, if the real field of vision can not see the traces of Solomon escape, as normal, he is dead. However, in Richard's heart, there is always a little anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a move, the huge regular tetrahedron reappeared again, this time the three faces representing the end of destruction did not appear, but on the surface there were hundreds of millions eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes, and the faces behind them, are souls, souls redeemed by Isaac’s real name. Now, Richard once again uses Isaac's real name to fully extract the free souls around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard finally determined that Solomon had escaped in some way. If his soul is destroyed, unless there is a light of annihilation, there will always be some residual soul fluctuations. Any fluctuation can't escape the perception of real name redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightest move in Richard’s mind puts this matter down. Since he was able to destroy Solomon's brain once, he could be destroyed for the second time. As time goes by, Richard’s strength will only grow stronger and stronger. There are still many secrets in the floating world that have not been discovered, and the reapers have some core rules that are not in control. Solomon's hiding in the dark side of the world, although advantageous, has the same drawback, that is, his study of one of the rules of light will become extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still very young, and the road ahead is still very long. There are a lot of first-class graces in the Eternal and Time Dragons. There are also Pinot in the world. Rand is a more powerful plane. All of this, to be explored, will be part of Richard's future power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, always standing on the side of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long years of the future, as long as Solomon and his scholars and wizards reveal clues, Richard can use the thunder to extinguish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at this metal fortress, although it was broken, but still of great value. He was preparing to explore it in the fort, and suddenly saw the shadows flowing not far away, and a beautiful and cold woman emerged from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she looks like a human being, her body is completely composed of shadows in Richard’s true vision. This is a special and powerful shadow creature. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow beauty with super strength is perhaps the peak of power that shadow life can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes fell on her right hand, holding a small light group in her palm, which was actually the soul of Solomon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpected surprise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know what kind of hatred the shadow creature had with Solomon and the Reaper, but could capture the soul of Solomon, but let Richard avoid the day. Big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This beautiful His Royal Highness, can I know your name? Also, can you give me the soul of Solomon in your hand?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman composed of shadows is tall, beautiful, nearly ten meters high, and has a strong and cold atmosphere throughout her body. This is the nature of the shadow creature. How strong she is is also a shadow life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed to a bullet and bounced the light ball of Solomon’s soul to Richard, saying, “This soul will of course be given to you. Only you have The means to completely annihilate him. As for me, you can call me A Lucia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly surprised: "A Lucia! You are Under the Temple of the Moon?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lucia showed a bitter smile and said: "The moon god has fallen. Now I am the shadow queen Ai Lucia. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
