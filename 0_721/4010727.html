			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven days are fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dead inside the altar, and Richard stood on a platform that stretched out of the mountain wall, looking down at the blood pool of the altar below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky over the throne of the cold iron is overcast, and the color of the lead is crushed, but there is no horror in the return of the high Germans on the same day, Noland is The plane of the plane has been leading the Faro for more than a thousand years, and the call of the Axiris transformation is naturally not as big as the original array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood pool is already boiling, and more and more black space ripples begin to appear above the altar. When the black ripples are interwoven to a certain extent, the two faint figures Jumping out of the space ripples and appearing above the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came out, the blood pool was completely boiling, and even picked up a few meters high blood waves, the two figures did not rush into the blood pool, but looked Look around and talk a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This return is exceptionally smooth, Rios, I never thought the coordinates would be so clear."<br /><br />&nbsp "Yes, Hill, don't you think it's a bit strange? The strength of our descendants should gradually decline. How can we send such clear coordinates?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill doesn’t care to say: "We haven’t been back for a few hundred years. It’s been a long time for a few geniuses to be normal. For us, It should be a good thing, and dissatisfaction will only be the waste of the Kingdom of God. I just don’t know what happened to this war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rios Silence for a while, said: "I hope so, this time the enemy looks very troublesome, Gao De Ori has no news, the descendants have issued a rescue signal, always makes me feel very worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill sneered a few times and said, "We will not be able to cope with the enemies who are in trouble. Since we both When you come back, you have to pay enough for the people who are in trouble. You say, how about destroying their country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rios said: "Be able to hit the cold iron throne, most of them have some shadows behind the gods, we find out who is intervening, and then wipe them out between the descendants of the world and the church."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill smiled and said: "This may be a few million lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rios said quietly: "Since we are enemies of our descendants So how many lives are just numbers, I will let the intruders taste the burning of hot iron in the internal organs, and the descendants should evacuate the core members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, let's go into the body and talk about it. As long as the blood is still there, there will always be ants. I hope that the body prepared by the descendants will not be too bad. Let us stay for a few more days, Rios, I just I have seen it, there should be no problem below."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rios nodded and sank into the blood pool with Hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boiling blood pool suddenly calmed down, and then the blood surface quickly fell, revealing two young people who looked at their physical condition and felt very satisfied. Then he floated up and wanted to fly out of the blood pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as they just emerged from the top of the altar, countless black runes suddenly emerged from the void, like a big net, covering Hill and Rios They are firmly branded on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two suddenly screamed with anger, and the body was branded with a black deity, and they couldn’t help but float and fell into the blood pool. Numerous black deities have been chased into the blood pool like a bee colony, and continue to be branded to Hill and Rios. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very strong silver brilliance in the blood pool, and one was converging. At this moment, the subsequent dense charms were all washed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Hill rose into the sky, violently glanced around and yelled: "Who is it? Give me out, come out, you guys just dare to hide The ants in the shadows, the dirty garbage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rios also slowly lifted off, said: "Hill, calm down, I think, this time we have met the guests whose power is not under us. For the real strong, we need to give enough respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard reached out and opened the space barrier in front of him, while letting go of the atmosphere that had been converging. At that moment, the eyes of Hill and Rios fell on Richard, and both Hill and Rios flashed. After doubts, the face became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill, who was originally in anger, suddenly calmed down and said, "Who are you descendants, call out your ancestors, I think, we have no reason not to know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill has already seen that Richard is not a legendary powerhouse, but he is already standing outside the legendary gate, and that Richard is so young, there must be a formidable powerhouse behind him, and a huge force. Such a person, even if the gods are counted, the entire history of Faro is countless, so Hill said that there is no reason not to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard said faintly: "This is my decision, it has nothing to do with my ancestors, and you can't know them, now, two I still think about my situation. You are now insinuated by crime. You can’t do without Faro.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillton has silver Light, a silver thread oozes from the body surface, waving constantly, and Rios re-enters the altar, hands fall, the whole altar hall immediately vibrates, and the sound of the sound of the metal is roaring from the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bulge on the ground, and soon a few steel-cast giants broke out. The hard granite floor of the altar became loose like a mud, showing its head. The steel shovel opened their eyes one by one, struggling to climb out of the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only for the first time, Rios summoned more than ten steel shackles, which is still in his sin, and his power is impaired. In the case, it seems that the Cold Iron Throne is indeed very suitable for Rios to exert its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hill’s silver line only extends beyond ten meters and no longer grows. According to his original strength, the silver line can be easily spread over the entire altar space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha met, smiled slightly, and as expected, this is the result of the power conflict between the Friends of Silver and the King of Iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two powerhouses are on different paths, but their strength is based on metal rules. In a limited space, the power of rules that can be mobilized is limited. Rios wants to exert the greatest power, and Hill must give in, and vice versa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let them leave the altar space, then the restriction nature does not exist, but now, the power of the two powerful players can not be played, and they are under each other. The result may not be as good as the strength of Rios when he was in full bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar itself is not only built in the mountainside, but also under the imperial palace, it is also located at an important node of the cold iron vein, so the surrounding space not only uses a solid and barrier-like material, but also adds an ancient magic effect. This is to protect the core secrets of the empire. At this time, the two kings could not break the altar space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is condescending and smiles and says, "I have a gift for you here, I hope you can be satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard reached out and sketched a few times in the air, and immediately formed a portal to create it out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill swept over and immediately sneered and said: "The shadow summons, a level 8 magic wants to give us a surprise, even if you summon The ability to summon three or four shadow warriors can be called, and not hundreds of thousands of cockroaches, no, hell!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill one When the words of ridicule have not been finished, they suddenly widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him, the newly formed shadow summoning portal quickly changed, expanding and consolidating, and instantly became a giant nearly ten meters high. The door, the door frame and the ordinary magic door are all different in light and shadow, solemn and majestic, each side is surrounded by a shadow snake, and the top is encircled with countless shadow warriors, guarding a huge gem that emits faint green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant door is dark black, emitting a metallic light, just like the essence, it is not a magical creation at all, the door is engraved with mysterious runes and The magical array, its complexity has far exceeded Hill's perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slowly opened, just opened a gap, and the innumerable shadow warriors sprayed out from the cracks in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of shadow warriors, which is simply a shadow frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Hill, even Rios also changed his face, the King of Iron immediately tried to tear the space to prepare to escape, but there are countless crimes in the body at the same time It is like a rope that tightly binds the spirit of Rios, so that it cannot be separated from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard has laid a light curtain of isolation in front of himself, quietly retreating from the space barrier that has already been set up. Behind him, it is a tsunami The sound of energy explosions, as well as the sound of Hill and Rios. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
