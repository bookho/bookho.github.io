			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of parsing these rules is not too high, it is equivalent to the general rules of Noland. But this is based on perceived recovery, with precise and clear space and time coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in the pub, with their chaotic perception and thinking ability, it is no easier to resolve the distortion rules than to analyze the underlying rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Richard immediately became stunned. The dark area is obviously a strong and strong world. In this place, the difference in strength will only be magnified dozens of times instead of shrinking. Richard has seen with his own eyes how ** powerful lizard people have been teased, killed, and even dismembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Richard has roughly cleared out what needs to be done. First of all, it is natural to analyze the rules and have the minimum self-protection power. Then explore the wasteland, identify the region of the gods here, and find the way to the dawn. The last is to find the sand, ignite the lighthouse, and put this area under the arm of the old dragon, in exchange for the opportunity to return to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Noland, Richard will plan a second abyss expedition. Just in front of him, there is an almost insurmountable obstacle, the peak, and the man on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the memory is distorted again, Richard clearly remembers the unbeatable sword! How to turn the entire Abyss deep into a sword of strength, how to deal with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now only vaguely feels that the sword is unlikely to really have the power of the entire Abyss. If that's the case, you don't have to fight anymore. Any master plane can't stand the man's cuts. But as far as Richard knows, this kind of thing is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like people can imagine that Laozi’s sword can cut down countless planes, but the real situation is that even a wolf can’t die. If the whole world wants to exist, it must have rules to maintain its existence. If the man really has such power, the existing world has long since collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Richard obviously has no ability to solve this problem, only to wait until after returning to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With physical strength and magic, Richard found that by consuming them, the ability to intelligently increase talents can be greatly improved, and the speed of analysis can be greatly accelerated. Now is not the time to cherish energy, so Richard directly activates the wisdom talent to the highest state, and the physical strength and magic immediately begin to slowly decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days unconsciously passed, with the soul of a strong man and a bloody tooth as the basis, Richard also resolved a rule of perceptual hierarchy. Now he has parsed a whole seven rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha picked up a stone, pulled out the moonlight, and made a stone carving. The stone carving is the statue of Su Hailun. It is very rare to be hand-made in Noland. It can already be included in the ranks of art. However, if you look closely, there are still some embarrassment in the engraving work, and there is not much magical color, which is far from the peak work of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this engraving has shown that Richard has recovered half the level of perception and control of his body. However, looking at this stone sculpture, Richard has a hunch that he may bring trouble to himself in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha counted the time and crushed the stone, and left the hut and walked to the pub. As for Su Hailun, he has already lived in his heart and has no need to rely on these external souvenirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the pub, someone called out: "Hey! Look, that kid is coming again! When he killed his teeth ten days ago, I can just look around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After someone immediately argued: "It is a matter of nine days ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least 11 days ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people quarreled over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li’s eyes swept away, he saw an old man sitting in the seat of the window, the one who took him into the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went over and sat down opposite the old man and asked, "Old Bar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for taking care of me!" said Li Cheng sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Barr smiled and said: "I don't just care for you. My eyes are not blurred to the point where I can't see clearly. If you let those guys attack you, I am afraid you can take the whole town. The people in the room are killing. In addition, I am taking you into the town, because there is one thing that may ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it. "Li did not immediately agree to it." As for the old Barr, he was able to kill the people in the town. He did not admit it and did not deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar took a deep look at Richard and said: "A long time ago, there was a man who came here. He is very strong, very strong, than us. All people must be strong, except...you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not speak, just continued to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man brought news of a distant city. It is a big city, it is said that there are thousands of people living. So many people can support The order of the light curtain is far more than our town, and the scope is even greater. I think that is where you are going, even your goal may not stop there. I will give you the coordinates of the city. And what I hope is that when you have the ability in the future, you can come back again and find ways to establish a relationship between the town and the city. Only then can we survive."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned and said, "Why don't you move over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar smiled and said: "You also saw it. The strength of these people is not strong. After leaving the curtain of order, it will not take long for most of them to die halfway. Even if I am, I am not sure that I can walk to the city alive."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise you. But I have to see how the order light curtain is born. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar finished the soup and stood up and said, "Come with me! This is not a secret. All people know this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the old Barr to the second floor and went to a small room without a window. There is a brazier in the middle of the room, which is burning with a faint flame. The flame seems to be extinguished at any time, but every time it swings, it will give off the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was amazed because he had seen something similar. That is outside the transmission point of the eternal vortex, the time the brazier placed by the strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order to maintain the light curtain is the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the hut, Li immediately felt that the whole body was cold and he could not help but have a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar obviously knew the strangeness in the room, wrapped in the clothes before coming in and said: "This room is not empty. Many souls of the deceased refused Dissipate, just here, I don’t know how many years. The time around the lights, for these souls who have nowhere to go, is the best place to stay. So they have been crammed in this room, more and more. Now I can't even remember how many souls there are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Licha is very moving, and most of the people who can come to the dark area are legendary powerhouses. Almost all of their soul fragments can be made into magical souls. After Richard’s real name of salvation, he has been able to directly enroll rules from the soul and form a magical soul, but he no longer has to tear the rule fragments from the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint radiance in his eyes, and in fact, in the real field of vision, one light after another emerged, even as many as hundreds! So many souls gathered together, naturally let this small room chill. If the person who is almost in the body stays here for a long time, going back will be a serious illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These souls have been stranded here. I don’t know how long, only the most primitive instinct is left. They want to be close to the fire of time, but they dare not approach too much. As a result, a soul accidentally caught a little bit of time, and immediately gave a sharp scream, burning and turning into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls were suddenly frightened and hid in the corners. After a long time, they gradually recovered their vitality and began to try to get close to the fire of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Bar also heard the screams, just sighed and said: "It’s another unlucky guy. But it’s always a relief. It’s stronger than being stuck in this small room.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I can help them," Richard said. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he will hand over the virtual press at the time of the fire, he said quietly: <br /> <br / "In my name, to give salvation." >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
