Only the man was left, and Richard sighed and sat back in his chair, staring out the window, the man walking toward the window, and when he was leaving, he looked back at Richard, suddenly Say: "If you really have the determination to go to the dark areas, then it is best to raise your title in the Eternal and Time Dragon several times, and at least get the time Lord, it is possible to come back alive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The title." Richard glimpsed, then his eyes narrowed and asked: "My current title is time lord, there are several levels."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are now a rambler, and then the world explorer, space master, then the time lord, not much, only three levels." The man smiled low, then said "This is just my personal advice. You can listen or not."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo, the servant of Vatican’s eternal servant." After that, the man jumped out the window. And then disappeared out of thin air, Richard did not see how he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has left his name, and Richard quickly searches for his memory. After a while, he remembers where he heard the name Lios. The Knights have a head that rarely appears, and it is this name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Leo left, Richard sat quietly, meditating, sitting all night, and before the dawn came, Richard finally stood up. Come to the window and look out to the floating island. At this moment, it is the darkest time, but the floating world is still full of glory, the streets are brightly lit, and people everywhere want to play to the dawn, this is prosperous, however It is also illusory, and Richard only feels that everything he sees is quite far away from him. He is like standing in another time and space, looking at the flashy scene in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Richard’s hand was getting tighter and tighter, and the window frame was screaming. He suddenly turned back and rang the call. After a few moments, several wizards were pulled from the bed and hurried to the magic hall on the underground of the castle. Richard was already standing in front of the ultra-remote communication magical array, thinking about what these wizards dare not delay. Immediately, the spirit was set up, and the communication magic array was reset according to the parameters given by Richard. After successfully starting, he exited the magic hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge magical array. The scope of communication can cover the entire Holy Alliance. After Richard took over the floating island, the first thing is to expand the communication and transmit the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited quietly for a moment, and the light on the magical array flashed, and then the image of Ellie was sketched out. She apparently just woken up. There is still tiredness on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich, what is so urgent, can't let me sleep more?" In private, Ellie is getting a little bit of a woman's taste. But that is only in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "It is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice stunned I looked at it and said, "I listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice, I want war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li's slightly indulged, the momentum of the chest has once again emerged, resolutely said: "I will give you war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha's eyes narrowed and said: "Okay, be prepared, wait for me to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Licha arrived at the floating island where the royal family was. When Richard arrived, the genius just started to shine, and Philip’s breakfast. It has been twenty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Richard’s briefing, he saw Philip in the breakfast room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodthirsty Philippe is now famous in Noland. It has already begun to compare him with the founding emperor Charles. No one laughs at his body. There are still many people who suspect Philip's injury in private, but no one dares to test temptations. The thick emperor is extremely terrible when combined with the same thick dragonslayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of the rising sun has stabilized. After several unsuccessful attacks, the heavy-duty Dakso Das people defaulted to the ownership of the Legion Fortress. Lord, now the Holy Alliance manages the rising sun on its own, and the management power of the day and night is one third out, for the other two human empire to share, but in the dusk, the Holy Alliance The power has already crushed the sacred dynasty and the millennial empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard sat down at the table, he saw that the emperor was almost exactly the same as the last time he met. The eating also looked a bit vulgar. Ten fingers were glued with oil and sometimes licked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Gordon once said, Philip is the biggest upstart of the Holy Alliance, but his outbreak is too great, in the mouth of the nobility The vulgarity becomes a true nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the arrival of Richard, Philip called out: "Come, sit down, eat first, we eat and say, these things are cold, no It’s delicious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not move the knife and fork, but sincerely said: "Your Majesty, this time in Calendo, I still have to thank You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp waved his hand and said, "What are you thankful for, you are my royal builder, no matter what you are." What did you do in Calando? It’s not just yours, it’s not yours, it’s about the face of our entire Holy Alliance. To be honest, I’m actually ready to go to the behemoth. I originally thought that you would die in the Snow Mountain Temple, so in this matter, if you don’t go to the beast to slay a few barbarian legends, let my face go where to go, say, or you are in the Eternal Dragon. The little girl in the temple had the most force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, Richard’s face immediately darkened and said: ...she has gone to the dark area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips was not surprised, nodded: "Soon sooner or later, this is the dragon of all time." The fate of the protagonist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has heard the hidden grief from the slight change of Philip's tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two apparently did not want to go deep into this matter, so they changed the subject. Richard said: "Your Majesty, this time I came here to You thank, in addition, I am preparing for the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe said while eating: "Want to play with the Holy Tree Dynasty, your goal is What."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"St. Louis Cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s action paused, if Thinking and saying: "That is the largest church on the northeastern border of the Holy Tree Dynasty. This is not the scope of the regional war, and it involves the belief...how much are you prepared to do."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was prepared and said: "Put it down, all the resistance of the sorcerers will be killed, surrendered and returned. After the war, I can return the church. I can even consider returning the arrested priests, as long as The Holy Tree Dynasty came up with enough sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you saw the sacred dynasty in the Snow Mountain Temple this time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only is it so simple, I also killed one of their six emperors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Pu Xiaoxiao was shocked and said: "Ury, he actually died in your hands. This is one of the seven angels of the Holy Tree Dynasty. Of course, they have only five angels left now." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was killed in a fair decisive battle, and the Snow Mountain Presbyterian Church and the Holy Temple can be proved." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A prince, only killing, killing, there is nothing big, but I heard that his strength is still sloppy, and is the user of the armed forces of heaven. Actually, this is also in your hands. It seems that you are very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Philip’s compliment, Richard smiled and said: "I am desperate, and he wants to fight, and it is normal to lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips sinks and says, "Your war Very adventurous, be careful, and pay attention to two things. One is that you can't marry St. Louis Cathedral. Also, those clergy can kill, but it's also not the same. This is the bottom line. If you don't cross the bottom line, then holy. If the tree dynasty wants to expand the scale of the war, then we will have a good fight with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is very sincere, and Philip can say that he has solved the biggest worries for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor continued: "I don’t care why you are so anxious about war, but since you want to fight, you must hurt the enemy and let them I don’t dare to provoke us easily.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li’s eyes, he said, “I think so too.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor waved his hand and said: "War is the thing of tomorrow, eat it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, outside the edge of the world, some don’t know The place, the three travelers are walking alone, they are wrapped in thick cloaks, can not see the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who walked in the forefront slowed down slightly, looked up at the sky and the surroundings, and said, "This place is really bad, but it is better than us." The place is still better, this is the dark area, I can't wait to meet the fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last traveler said: "Ige You are always so impatient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foremost traveller showed a handsome face, it was a fighting sergeant Io, he snorted disdainfully Said: "This shows that I am a normal person, who is like your monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing is Naiyou, the middle of the nature is the sand The sand was smashed up and looked around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a barren land, full of rocks and gravel, and there are several solitary tall stone pillars in the distance, which constitute the only scenery here, the earth is black rock There is no sun in the sky, it is thick gray, and I don’t know where it comes from, it is weak enough to barely illuminate the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the endless dark wasteland, there are only three lives. Compared with this vast world, they are like three gravels in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to go." Flowing sand said faintly, and walked with two guardians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world of despair and death, no life, no water, even light, and they don’t know where they are, destination Where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel slightly delayed, and in parallel with Naiyou, whispered: "His Royal Sands now seems less sad."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nai nodded and said: "Yeah, some strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
