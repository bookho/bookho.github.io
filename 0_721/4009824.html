			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee spread the map on the table and pointed to a small map The town said, "This is the town of Jovan, and it is also the target we have to capture this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Osfa, the town of Jovan is large Much more and more prosperous. It is the junction of many villages and baron castles in the mountains. The mountain wood, minerals, hides and other specialties must pass through the covenant, and the adventurers who are ready to enter the forest area will choose Jovan instead of Osfa as a recharge place. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than 500 households, more than 2,000 people with a large number of shops, adventurers can find a variety of supplies here, from the blacksmith shop Go to the alchemy workshop and have everything. The only important building that is not here is the temple. The god of courage only built a temple in the baron's collar city. It was a magnificent building and a proof of the piety of the Baron of Fossa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of building and maintaining the temple matches its macro size, so even Fossa cannot support the construction of a second shrine in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorfan Town is the territory of the High York Jazz. The Jazz built a large-scale manor outside the town, where he usually lives. Near the manor is the jazz knight battalion, and more than 30 elite private soldiers belonging to the high-level self are usually stationed in the knight's camp. However, now, the Cavaliers are empty and there are only a few young ones who live in it. All the elite warriors have been escorting the singular invaders with the high jazz, and they have never returned. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in recent days, there have been flustered people everywhere in the High Jazz manor, as well as the unprecedented guards. These guards have only received superficial training, even the regular soldiers are not counted, but now the power of the town of Jovan has been swept away, and they have to call them out of the field, temporarily on top of the guard position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad that fled back a few days ago has brought back the news of the defeat. The bad news is like the fire in the dry season of the grassland, and it burns the entire baron collar in a blink of an eye. Both Lian Mintai and Sir Hu Bo were killed on the spot, so the high-ranking Jazz as the starting force was obviously fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows when the ectopic demon will appear, so some of the relatives in the manor’s side of the jazz have already begun to pack their bags and are ready to flee. . Their actions have even more panic. However, most people are still calm and not eager to escape. It is not far from the Baron of the Visa, the Baron has a strong army, and the Temple of Courage does not sit and watch the actions of the invaders. And behind the Baron of Fossa, there is also the Earl of Galleon, one of the three great counts of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then people in the town of Jovan ushered in another night in panic and uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Jovan is about forty-nine kilometers from the mountains, due to the frequent presence of adventurers and mercenaries, and the resistance of the World of Warcraft that occasionally rushes out of the forest. In the tide, the town of Jovan built the city wall, and there are also defensive high walls and arrow towers around the main building of the high jazz manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has just arrived, a smart figure appeared outside the town of Jovan, he whispered around the town and then turned over the wall In. Another wandering in the town like a ghost, once again over the wall. The three-meter-high wall in the town was not an obstacle for him. A moment later, he appeared again in the high-lying manor, and also walked around to see the terrain and defensive power. He perfectly used the cover of the night, and the fresh rookies in the tower did not find his trace at all. After reviewing all the important places, he quietly left by the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour later, a small team quietly appeared outside the town of Jovan. Richard looked far and wide, and through the night, he could faintly see the outline of the town of Jovan. He waited patiently. After a while, the elf Olal emerged from the night and whispered: "Master, about 50 people in the town of Jovan are armed and powerful. But the trouble is now the town. There are quite a few adventurers and a small team of mercenaries. There are about 50 people in total. Their individual strength is much stronger than the militia. I feel that there are a few guys with six or more levels. Close to reconnaissance. There are many people defending Gao’s manor, but the strength is not strong enough. They are all militia. However, the knight camp of Gao’s is not far from the manor, there are about 30 squatters, and the same number of servants. At the time, they can be armed and become a force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wars?" This is the main concern of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war horses are mainly concentrated in the manor and the knight battalion. There are about forty horses in the upper ranks, and half in each of the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very satisfied with the information. He took out the map and finally confirmed it. He said, "They have a good road and give them some weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-prongedly took the bundled weapons and shields from the back and distributed them to the five formerly captured soldiers. Everyone got a steel knife and a small round shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five warriors were originally civilians, and their loyalty to the lord was limited. In the face of real death threats, they could only choose to survive. Under the guidance of the familiar captives, Richard was able to go deep into the baron's collar and appear outside the town of Jovan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard took three stepping knights, and their equipment was a big shield. The remaining four stepping knights stayed in the base to guard the prisoners who refused to surrender. Everyone else followed Richard to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the high estate of the first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of Richard, this The team, through the cover of the night, rushed to the manor of Gao. In the shadows of different sizes, there are also horror silhouettes of three alien beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of Gao’s manor are closed, and several burning torches illuminate a small area in front of the door. There is an archer in each of the two sentry towers behind the gate. At this moment, they are hiding behind the tower and occasionally sweeping into the darkness. Although it is early summer, but the cool outside of the style tonight, the high tower, the wind is particularly large, so that the two sentinels have a very hard time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentinel has become a group, the old leather armor is as cold as a piece of steel plate soaked in water. He whispered a few words of the weather, just wanted to move, and suddenly heard a very subtle voice in his ear. The sentinel immediately alerted, slammed up, and the probe looked out of the wall. As a result, Richard jumped into the tower like a ghost, grabbed his mouth with one hand, and slammed it into his heart with a dagger! The sentinel struggled for a long time before he slowly moved. In another sentry tower, the Elf Oral is like a shadow, and a post on the back of the sentinel, the sentinel immediately fell down softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Oral solve the guard of another sentry tower, Richard cast a zero-level magical flame hand. In the deep night, this blaze is particularly eye-catching. Then one by one murderous figure rushed out of the darkness and rushed to the manor. While seeing the fire, the Elf Oral jumped into the manor from the tower, and the guide of the eternal sleep with water cut off the chains on the manor door, and then slowly opened the heavy door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
