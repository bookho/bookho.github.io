The rooms here are located in the Outer Fort. Subsequently, the two young maids brought new clothes and accessories and filled the barrels of the bathroom with hot water. The Marquis of Gordon arranged to meet with Richard at dinner, before he had to bathe and change, and take a rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bathing dressing is coming to an end soon, and Richard is lying on the bed, and he has an hour to rest. Although the fatigue of the long journey is still there, but now he can not let the noisy head subsided a little. When the two maids were present in the bath, Xiao Li did not even move a finger and completed the whole process. In fact, he tried to refuse and struggle, but was easily suppressed by the maid. Their posture is weak, but their strength is even larger than that of the village chief. They are suppressed and have no resistance. They are from head to toe, and they are washed clean from the roots to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room where Richard is located is not large, but it is as high as five meters. There is a high and narrow window in the position of three meters high. . The walls are made of black slate and have not been specially polished to maintain the original appearance when they were mined. The rough wall is decorated with tapestries and knife shields. The tapestry is dark red. How does Li think it feels like red blood. The room is very dark, and if it is not illuminated by a torch, even the midday line of sight will be a bit fuzzy. Lying in bed, Richard only felt that the scent of breath continued to emanate from the ground, the walls, and every corner. There was a fire in his blood vessels, which was the fire that was provoked by the two maids. They were still secretly laughing at the time. Clever Richard, I feel that they are intentional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold and the fire are intertwined, making Richard's head more chaotic. From the moment you left Rutherland Village, no, as early as the beginning of the enlightenment ceremony, everything is like a dream, the world is extremely unreal. Just in the chaos, the door knocked and the dinner time was up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination is the evening restaurant in Neburg, a long distance from the room. Behind the maid who led the way, Richard’s impression was only big and dark. All the buildings are so tall that the long and tortuous passages, though illuminated, cannot cover every corner, leaving large shadows, swaying shadows, and even darkness that the eyes can’t penetrate. As for the past. In the outdoor part, the light and shadow of the dense plant branches and leaves are disturbing the line of sight, and the nerves of the people are involuntarily tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle seems to be filled with a faint scent everywhere, lingering in front of him, entangled in every step he took. Let him feel the rejection and discomfort from the soul, but can not be expressed in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening restaurant is not the largest restaurant in the Black Rose Fortress, but the scale is absolutely up to the Duke level, the 15 meter high hall is extremely high and dark, although the wall is It was full of torches, but it was difficult to illuminate the murals of the dome. The table is 20 meters long. Richard is dressed in a noble boy's costume. He sits at the end of the table and is far away from his father through a table where 30 people can eat at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a man with a strange charm, with a smile on his face, a meticulously combed hair and a thick short beard. . The years have left a little trace of invisible on his face, and the corners of his eyes have climbed up a few fine lines. The dark green eyes are clear and pure, but the people who look in are almost topless. He sat freely, skillfully cutting the grilled lamb chops in the dish, eating quickly, and occasionally taking a sip of red wine. There is a strange rhythm in his movements. In fact, even the most discerning ceremonial presence is unable to find any omissions in his manners. Of course, he ate too fast and too much. However, his elegance is hard to notice. Just a few breaths, a few kilograms of lamb chops have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very elegant and attractive man, and Richard has to admit it, even though he wants to throw out the silver plate in his hand and lie on the man's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, he will have a deeper understanding of the number of people who want to put things on the face of the Marquis of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Little Richard has held back, not for himself, but for his mother. Until now he still does not understand the meaning of his mother's wish, but perseverance, patience and wisdom let him know that in the near future will understand the meaning of this deep meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to sit upright and squat, and dealt with food with clumsy movements. The food in front of you is very rich, and the kitchen of the Black Rose Castle is famous for its cuisine, with the best red meat cooks and pastry chefs throughout the peninsula. But Richard didn't know what it was like to send something in his mouth. Richard never trained etiquette, and the knife and fork grips were known to come out of the country at a glance. They did not know the rules of the nobility. However, Xiao Li, who had changed his clothes, was very beautiful. The temperament of depression and melancholy was similar to that of Gotton. Many of the maids who came in and out of the water were secretly aiming at Xiao Licha. Richard is now a teenager, and in a year or two, there should be a man’s charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant and magical elimination of more than twenty kilograms of lamb chops, the Marquis of Gordon wiped his mouth with a white cloth, smiled. His mouth is very big, and when he smiles, he reveals a row of white teeth, which is a bit dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are called Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just nodded and didn't say anything. He can hear that Gordon used a narrative tone, which does not need to be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smiled and said, "You are very lucky, because your name is Archimonde; you are also unfortunate, also because of the name of Archimonde. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then raised his head and met Gordon’s gaze. He said, "My name is Richard."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s eyes are clear, but few people can look at him. However, Richard has raised his head and never retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smiled first, then sighed and said: "The character is very similar to your mother! But she did not say that your name is Richard. Moon song." Although it is a question, it is still a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Li hesitated and finally said: "No." Now, he has some understanding of some mothers' minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you are still named Archimonde, whether you accept it or not," Gotton said. At this time, he had finished the meal of all the main dishes, waved his hand, and the ten maids walked up in the water, packed up the used meals, and then replaced them with new tableware and served up to seven meals. After dessert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon solved the dessert in the same elegant and quick way, saying: "It’s useless. Even the most senior aristocrats can’t pick me up. In the manner of etiquette, but the old aristocrats still think that I am a nouveau riche. And another big man, we call him ' bloodthirsty Philip', the favorite dish is the raw World of Warcraft meat, the request is It should not be cut from the living body for more than an hour. If it is a rare species, the time limit can be relaxed to one day, and the noble adult likes to personally tear the meat entrance by hand. But the nobles still admit that he has a true aristocratic style. Do you know why this is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and he knew nothing about the world of the nobility. All the knowledge is from Mordred, and the knight is obviously not a qualified teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this bloodthirsty Philippe is the greatest emperor of our Holy Alliance empire! His power is too strong and moody, so the old aristocrats are not willing to anger him. If there is such a big man in his own circle, there will be many real interests. These interests are so large that they can’t be rejected.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded this time and understood a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, since your surname is Archimonde, then it is unfortunate that you must become stronger and become more powerful! With strength, the world is right You are heaven, and no power is hell! At that time, you don't need to worry about whether you grew up in the mountains, or you are born in the most magnificent and magnificent castle, and you don't have to pretend like I am now. These are illusory. You don’t have any meaning for you now, you just need to be strong! Because your name is Archimonde, the blood of Archimonde is flowing in your blood vessels! As long as you have this surname, people will It will be full of expectations, and it will be extremely high. If you are only stronger than ordinary people, it will disappoint everyone." Gordon’s voice is getting louder and louder, and later it’s like a sound in the ear. The thunder of the sound, the shock of the little Licha dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the knife and fork in his hand and couldn’t take care of the piece of food that fell into the plate from the tip of the fork without any etiquette. The posture remained incomparably elegant, but there was a deafening man who did not match it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon suddenly converges on the thunderous voice and reveals the charming smile, saying: "As long as you have enough power, you can do whatever you want, no matter what." That makes sense, or something completely ridiculous, like this.” Speaking, Gordon recruited a maid, reached for the tears in her chest, and the whole piece was torn in half. Let her be completely red-naked in an instant. The maid instinctively screamed, but immediately swallowed the follow-up screams, hands on both sides of the body, no slightest to reveal the intention of bare breasts - room and lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the butler and several servants, there are several guards and ten knights in the restaurant. They stand quietly against the wall and live like a statue. Modred, who took Richard from Rutherland, was among them. At this time the statues all came alive, of course, they still maintained the standard standing position, but the sights fell unscrupulously on the maid's **. Her appearance is not very beautiful, but her youth is full of vitality and temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stunned, and the impact of this scene on him was too intense. He was only a 10-year-old child. The resilience of the small temper has played a role. He pinched the knife and fork and did not drop them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon waved his hand, and the maid dared to pick up his clothes, but he did not dare to cover his body, keep the same posture in peace, and bowed his knees. Then I left the restaurant after facing the host, and I dared to turn around in the corridor. She is afraid that if she runs out of school, she is likely to have a more tragic situation. Sure enough, behind her came the voice of Gordon: "Licha, I still want to kill the individual to show you, but some time ago, I was in a bad mood, and all the killers were killed. Speaking, other nobles are here. The eyeliner is really quite a lot! Unfortunately, I didn’t control my temper at the time, but now no one can kill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little face of Richard is pale, How can killing such things be said in such an understatement? But everyone in the restaurant, from the servant to the knight, looks as usual. It seems that the owner only said something like prey and food. Until then, Richard was faintly aware of the faint breath in the castle. It seems to be the bloody suffocation that has accumulated over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
