She is still the iceberg-like expression, but the pride and sarcasm in her eyes are gone, replaced by pale and dark gray. Minnie’s lips smirked with a mocking smile, but this time it was given to herself. She landed on both feet, so she stood next to Stevenson and looked out the window with him. He said, "I really don't have capital pride, and I can't really give up everything. So I will choose with you. Stand together, you treat me as a woman, a partner and a friend, even if it is a subordinate, but I don't play things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Devenson didn't answer, just squinting his eyes and staring at the harsh winter scene outside the window with dangerous eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini sighed and continued: "Don't you think this is a bit strange? Richard didn't even learn how to draw a complete magic pattern before. You have the guidance of Santa Cruz, using the most advanced materials, and it took about half a month to complete a 40% completion of the magic pattern, Lee How can I directly make available building plug-ins?......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini's words let Stevenson calm down and start thinking: "What do you mean? Is that magical structure not made by Richard? No, it is impossible! Master Phil will not lie, because that is meaningless, and he does not need to be biased between Soram and Archimonde. The texture is definitely made by Richard himself. But you are right, the whole thing is very strange. Richard’s curriculum has already been obtained. According to the curriculum design, this kid will be the fastest one year later. I started to learn about the construction and manufacturing. There must be a crucial factor behind the scenes, so that Richard can break through countless times. The obstacles that people can't break through in their lifetime have made a leap. Now what we need to know is what this key is. Even if I can't use it, it will be inspiring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie frowned and said: "This is very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very difficult. Richard has few friends and rarely interacts with unrelated people. The most contact with him is the magician who taught the class, and these old guys are almost all inhuman. This is dark blue, I can't track Richard and see who he is dealing with. Even if he can buy his whereabouts, the movement is too big.” Stevenson frowned involuntarily, and Randolph’s former car was especially in front of him, showing direct maliciousness to the students who were also His Royal Highness. The teacher is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene! We should probably ask her to ask, maybe I can get the answer!" Minnie suggested. "After all, she is the only woman who has been so close to Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson shook his head and said, "Irene? What can she do?" I originally thought that she was a woman that Richard liked. Otherwise, why did the law enforcement mage group specifically ban her, and she was not allowed to go to bed with Richard? I took the lead and she wanted to let Richard be angry or It’s completely decadent. If you can stimulate him to use some fierce means for me, it’s even better. But you also saw that there is no result at all. Richard’s study and life rules have not changed a bit, even emotional reactions. I can't see it. This is also called like? And time has passed so long, Richard must have lost interest in her. Such an important secret, how could he tell a woman who can't help at all? Now and then there is The difference, if I and Irene let Richard know, maybe it will only be counterproductive. After all, now the old guys are obviously on his side! Don't think that the old guys are confused!" Br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie doesn't think so: "Trying there is no harm. And you don't understand the woman's mind. I can see that at least Irene is a little careful, so she will never tell Lee what happened between you. Inspect, at least not tell him the details. But she must have known that there is no future for Richard and Richard. After you have used it, it is even clearer. Since there is no hope, why not use the past feelings to change one? A lot of money, as long as the amount of money can exceed her psychological expectations. Women in the fringe area are actually the same, if she really persists, it will not make you so easy to get."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson hesitated and finally nodded. However, he immediately sighed again and said with a slight sigh: "Even if you know the secret behind it, the gap that has been created is difficult to make up. Although the overall evaluation of this guy is only excellent, it is far less than me. But evaluation is not everything. At least the talent he showed now is no worse than me. What's more...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson smiled a bit and then said: "Now he The resources that can be used in cultivation are far more than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that Richard’s monthly income is not too much a secret, as long as someone with a status status wants to know. Richard’s total income is actually not too high, but the expenditure is far lower than Stevenson. Most of Stevenson’s bills are used to pay him and Minnie’s rent and tuition, as well as the mixed expenses. After deducting this part, the money that can be used in course study, magical experimental materials, and recovery medicine is less than half of that of Richard. These are the expenses that directly affect the progress of magic practice. And the production of the primary power magic grain structure hollowed out almost all his reserve resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson has poured a large amount of spirits down, letting the burning liquid flow from the throat to the chest, he has already vaguely felt himself The effort after entering Deep Blue has a directional bias. He once thought that he used the conspiracy and conspiracy perfectly, and used Irene to attack the opponent mentally, to draw all the useful people to isolate the opponent, and to exhaust all resources to show his talent and strength as a builder. But the result gave him almost a devastating blow, and Richard won the war without a declaration of war with more than two major levels of progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson couldn’t help but reflect, did he do too much extra action, if he put all his energy and resources directly into the builder’s In terms of learning, will the results be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue is different from the outside world. There is no need for a fig leaf of public opinion. It does not require the name of justice. It only needs the joy of Su Helun and the absolute strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini looked at the ambitious man around her, showing a frustrated and frustrated expression, and suddenly felt the red/naked body chilling, and the heart began to tighten together. . The finger gently rubbed through her smooth and tender skin. At this time, she felt not humiliation, but a strong chill. If Stevenson gave up, he also had the blood of the Dragon Warlock and a strong mother, and she What can be left? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie hesitated for a long time and said slowly: "Perhaps there is a shortcut in the end, although the possibility is not too big."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the solution?" Stevenson rushed to ask, as if the drowning person suddenly saw the driftwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to approach the teacher and get her good feelings. I recently instinctively, the teacher's mood is becoming more and more unstable, this is a good time. Although the teacher is a legendary mage, she is also a woman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
