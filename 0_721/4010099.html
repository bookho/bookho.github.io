			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him immediately said: "There are three kinds of abilities that have been known, one It is 'adult' and it is said that at an unspecified stage, the blood-wounded person will enter the stage of slumber, and during this period the strength will be greatly enhanced, at least to the extent of the 16th-level sanctuary. The second is 'War talent', the ability to awaken, can greatly improve the combat power in the battle, and occasionally there will be a demon magic effect in the attack. The last one is the 'natural field', which can improve the magical speed of the magician and enhance the natural magic. Power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and down at Heim, and asked with some play: "The ability of your awakening... Is it 'adult"?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! But I still don't know when I will sleep." Heim was proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and patted his head with his hand. It is no wonder that the blood of the holy unicorn can be juxtaposed with the blood of the dragon, and the ability is really against the sky. In particular, this ‘adult’, no matter who it is, just needs to sleep a night to become a sanctuary, and it’s no wonder that this Him is doing nothing all day. He doesn't need to work hard at all, just eat and sleep, wake up to play, and play tired and eat. It is also reasonable for the Sequoia Kingdom to attach importance to the blood of the unicorn. As long as the ability to awaken the blood, it is possible to directly harvest a future sanctuary strong. Who would not pay attention to such a good thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I think of myself from the moment I left Rutherland Village, I didn’t have a longer rest, and I didn’t even dare to sleep more. To the level of the 12th-level magician, and as long as he can sleep a level, he can far exceed himself, and Richard finally lost his balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real darling of fate... Richard stared at the white face of Him, thinking with sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end, Richard couldn’t help but say a little bit: "As you are, it’s just sleeping as a sanctuary, and only It is the weakest of the Sanctuary's strong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himehehe smiled, but he was not ashamed to say: "Nothing! When I am too big, I only pick ten." One or two levels of play will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a big headache, interrupted Shim’s words and said, "Okay! I understand. Now We should talk about remuneration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remuneration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For your shield Remuneration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him wailed: "Are we not already talking about remuneration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I just changed my mind! Now I think it's better to return you to the Countess Ekaterina!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Hem screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard reached an agreement with Him. The results of the extra blackmail include that Him's family provides a large amount of fine-grade equipment for Richard's parity, and supplies a sufficient amount of rare minerals to Richard. In the scope of supply given by Viscount Heim, Richard found that there are three varieties that can sell high prices in Noland, which is an unexpected gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, he still couldn’t understand why Richard suddenly raised the price. But he finally got the two most important things, the supply of enchanting equipment and structures, and the escape from the life of the Countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away Shim, Richard suddenly felt a lot of comfort. Now, he can finally say that he has gained a firm foothold in the Faro plane, and he can already gain income from the plane war. In absolute terms, Richard’s income is even higher than that of Gotham’s long-running Shulan. However, the essential difference is mainly from the identity of the analysts and the support of the eternal dragon temple represented by the quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the richness of Faro is by no means comparable to Hughland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next period of time is to wait for the aristocrats who participated in the cross-line plan to send the army. This process will be very long, and it will take half a month to assemble the forwards. It takes a month for all the troops to assemble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare one-month free, Richard is determined to devote his time to the production of the structure, and spare time is all used to meditation to improve the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of personal strength has now become a serious injury to Richard. From the sacrifice, Richard learned that the ability to raise the spirit of the spirit of the spirit, it is possible to greatly enhance the effect of the dark blue series of meditation. This is the only known way to speed up the magic. The starbursts captured by Dark Blue Fantasy have the effect of enhancing blood flow, but they can not be used to increase the power of the blood. This is a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this night of meditation, Richard merged into the body with two points of capture, and barely manipulated their direction, guiding them to the magical star The backbone of the plant. However, the ability of Xingmang to divert is very limited, only one is finally integrated into the magic star, and the other is finally integrated with Richard's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main star of the Magic Star is still the first time to get a starburst supplement. After blending into the starburst, it seems to have some luster, but it seems to have no change. Fortunately, Richard has a real talent that can be digitized, or else it is really difficult to detect such subtle changes. In the second hour, Richard did not have such good luck. He only captured a starburst for an entire hour, and did not melt into the trunk of the magic star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night, Richard finally captured 26 stars and successfully integrated 10 into the magic star trunk. By the end of the meditation, the original vague star of the magic star finally showed a touch of green. That is the color of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a little change, Richard’s confidence increased. So in the next month, Richard always sent the captured starburst to the magic star trunk as much as possible. Until the night before the completion of the assembly of the line, the 300th star was integrated into the main star of the magic star, and the trunk of the dead wood suddenly shook, and slowly appeared on the top branch. leaf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the Elven Blood Star has finally recovered! Richard almost jumped up and cheered! The ability to successfully activate the magic star has seen the power of dark blue fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it is not far from the dawn, and Richard continues to meditate according to his excitement. Soon after entering the meditation, the new leaves at the top of the main star of the magic star in Richard began to tremble gently. After a while, there were seven or eight stars at the same time around Richard! And there is one that is especially huge, double the size of a common star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge surprise almost made Richard directly out of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activation of the magic star blood, Richard's meditation efficiency has increased by a third. The bottleneck is no longer that we can't find a star, but Richard can't capture so many stars. Fortunately, the emergence of a particularly large guy in the emerging star, it became the first choice of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after another hour of meditation, Richard’s state of mind was finally difficult to calm down, so he withdrew from the state of meditation. The harvest is huge today, and proper indulgence is also necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out the window, about half an hour from dawn, it is the darkest time. So Richard slid out of the house and patrolled the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now most of the aristocratic forces are in place, and they have camped outside the blue water oasis, forming a dozen or so camps of all sizes. The camp of Viscount Heim is next to the station of Richard’s troops. Looking away, the quiet and shining magic torch in the Viscount camp, I saw a team of patrol soldiers tidying up and down, in addition, there is no other messy figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, the military ranks of other nobles’ private camps are much worse. The best is the vassal army of the Duke of the Wolf, but there are always scattered soldiers walking around. The camps of some aristocratic private soldiers were simply empty, and it was obvious that they collectively went to Oasis City to have fun. The other aristocratic camp was brightly lit, and the sound of the blasphemy was far away, still in the carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these troops, Richard could not help but shook his head. However, he did not intend to rely on this rogue private army. And even if there is no fighting force in the private army, Richard confidence can also let them play some role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the darkness, suddenly there is a little more light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t have to look at it, I know that the guy who always makes himself so brilliant at any time and place must be Io. Speaking of it, he did not see Io in a month. Occasionally seeing the sand, there is no Iowian figure around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, after the pain of the Iraqi-Russian, Richard was consciously broad-minded. However, if the fighting sergeant is still so open-minded, Richard does not mind to open his heart. Anyway, the facts have proved that the great magician's mind has great potential to dig, and compared with the kind of mind that can seem to be inclusive of the world, at least it is not comparable now. But when necessary, Gordon can also make his mind small enough to not be a grain of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light around them is getting brighter and brighter. Io-Russian has stood side by side with Richard and looks at the colorful private military camps in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Great Sorcerer, shouldn't you be meditating at this time?" Io asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but said: "If you are so radiant when you fight, it will become the target of the enemy shooter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Don't you know that the battle priests of the Eternal Dragon Hall are not afraid of the shooter?" Io said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not afraid of the shooter, does not mean that you are not afraid of the killer. Otherwise, it will not be stunned by me." Richard said leisurely. Now in front of Iowa, he is confident enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't take long, I will be level 14." Io tried to change the angle against Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For a while, I will still be twelve." Richard said. Indifferent words have strong self-confidence, so that Iraq and Russia continue to frown. The last melee, it can be said that Iowa did not expect Richard to be so desperate, and the body is so strong, it can be said that Richard's luck is good enough. But when Io was raised to the 14th level, he did not believe that Richard had any chance to win. Sometimes the difference in power level can't be compensated by skill alone, not to mention the defending skills of the heavenly guards will be promoted with the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard added: "Do you dare to fight with people who are lower than your own level? When I was in the Faro, I was faced with a much higher level of enemies."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel is not moved by Richard’s words: “Grade is the real advantage! Then, Lord Magi, I heard that you have a very powerful teacher. In less than a year, I was able to hold two highest-level sacrifices. It’s hard to imagine!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said: "I have a good teacher and a good family. As for my parents, I have given me good blood. But if you and I have it all together, you will definitely be stepped on by me now. Lao Tzu is working hard, trying to study the structure, and even when he feels reluctant to sleep, what are you doing?? So, don’t take these things and have the ability to take me down!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russ also laughed and said, "Don't think that you are only working diligently! Let's walk, anyway, anyway It’s still growing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Continue to blow!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle priest is finally furious, he The military camp in the distance pointed out and said with a sneer: "Are you going to rely on these rabble to penetrate the blood-stained land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my hand, a sheep will become a lion! I want to get through the blood of the land, still rely on me!" Io said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said, "Under my hand, a group of sheep will become wolves! When you don't show this thing, is it old? Isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel for a moment, said: “Mr. 12, the great magician, then I will see, in your hands. What kind of miracle can be created!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a big arrogance, and at the same time he was in a hurry. Anyway, no one left or right, he simply opened his pants. I started to put water on the grass and said, "I will let you see! But if you don't listen to my command, then leave me here, I don't need a guy who can't move, even if that guy is a fight. God official. Speaking badly, this war is really a lot of you, not a lot of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian snorted Suddenly, he opened his trousers and put water on his side. He bit his teeth: "You are as shameless as Lao Tzu? Cheating is only for you nobles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, in Lebanon The night before, a great magician and a battle Priest, facing the same bush began fighting alternative, the results were evenly divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day was the day when Richard first reviewed the aristocratic army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All private forces were taken to the same venue in turn, and Richard was reviewed with representatives of the nobility. This comparison, the quality of the private army is high, and it is clear at a glance. Most of the vassals of the Duke of the Wolf are militants, and the military is not necessary to say. However, the most elite is the army of Viscount Heim, which surprised everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee already knows the reason, because the army of Viscount Heim is actually the father of his deer, and the Duke of Glasgow, who is fine-tuned. And his mother also transferred some elite warriors from her family. Therefore, the family has made a bloody for the re-emergence of Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
