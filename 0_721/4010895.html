			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year, Richard personally planted the Golden World Tree here, and Because of this, the will of the Golden World Tree regards Richard as the closest life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the will of the Golden World Tree has just awakened, and like a little baby who doesn’t understand anything, only simple emotional changes have not yet opened up wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but some instinctive abilities have begun to awaken, for example, the brilliance from the canopy will be of great benefit to the growth of the spirit, and After discovering that Green Sun has no sun, the Golden World Tree adjusts its own light according to the changes of the night, thus forming a day and night change that is almost consistent with Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The springs in the moon wells that are developed by Yongji Jīngling are mostly used to water the golden world tree, and a small part is kept to prepare for the illness or injury of the family. use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuejing Spring Water also has a considerable role in promoting the wisdom and growth of the tree of life and the world tree. In this way, the world tree and the higher spirits are interdependent and support each other. This will be a warm and splendid operation of this small world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just less than a hundred kilometers away from the Golden World Tree is the nest of the mother's nest. This distance seems to be far away, but it is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Golden World tree is fully grown, its radius of the canopy may exceed one hundred kilometers, which means that the mother's nest actually lives in The door of the Golden World Tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came to the nest of his mother's nest, a strange and innocent voice sounded in consciousness: "Welcome to your arrival, master." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master." Richard felt a little unexpected about this title. "The soul of your body has been dúlì, it calls my master, I think more is a It’s a habit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nest’s avatar rang again: “The body is the body, and I am me, for me, take me to Greenson. And you who give me the opportunity to grow up will always be my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer made Richard even more surprised. He flew to the nest of his mother's nest and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, it is a huge open space of tens of kilometers. All the trees here have been cleaned up and replaced with the familiar nest forest. From afar, there are nearly a hundred giant worm nests standing tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene surprised Richard, even in the turbulent land where the mother's nest is located, there is not such a large number of nests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Nest and the Nest Forest, low-level combat units can be produced endlessly, and high-level combat units do not have to worry about food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is doubt in Richard’s mind, and the Brood Warfare unit has a very strong digestive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the humanoid knight seems to eat and drink like a human warrior, but when necessary, they can live the same with the banyan tree, and the combat power is not reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the environment like Lin Hai, it is simply food for the mother nest creation, and there is a need to consider so many supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew around the nest and finally came to the top of the nest and slowly descended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is in the nest of the zhōng yāng, although it is only eight steps, but the size is huge, the length has exceeded 900 meters, and the body is almost the same size . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is eating, countless worker bees swarming, sprinkle a pale yellow sèr sputum into a small lake, and then hurried away, this small lake It is composed entirely of the yellow sèr sputum, and the nest is crouched on the edge of the lake, constantly sucking the r sputum in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha waved a trick, and a group of r sputum flew into the palm of his hand. After hesitated, he still tasted a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r The sputum has some sour taste, which is obviously not in line with human taste, but it is rich in nutrients and energy, almost no impurities, and can be almost completely absorbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R sputum like this, as long as a small mouth is enough to meet the needs of a warrior throughout the day, and in the r sputum, Richard also noticed a strong The energy of life, after he tasted a little, there were temporary activations in many organs of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatar's avatar and body look almost exactly the same, but Richard sees the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell on the top of the avatar, and the fingertips ignited a light blue sè flame, and he poked down. The insects were softer than the one expected by Richard. It can't resist Richard's attack, and the thickness of the insect is less than two meters. Compared with the huge body, it is just a thin shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frown said: "Your defense is too bad, don't say legend, that is, a strong person in the sanctuary can be seriously injured, even kill you, you The ontology is much more powerful, and it is now fully capable of fighting against the legendary powerhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother nest said: "Master, Greenson can not threaten My existence, I am very safe here, why waste energy in the impossible to appear in danger, and now every bit of energy waste will affect the future development."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother nest continues to state in a calm and unwavering manner: "As a mother's nest, creating a combat unit is our innate mission, and this cycle of creation is calculated in days, so if time After a year of growth, the energy that is wasted now will be magnified to a very large number. If you look longer, the number will increase and it will be too intolerable. This process is like what humans say. Snowballing, the final snowball will roll more and more, harvest so, damage The same is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is very surprised, but does not fully agree with its point of view: "You look like this, equal to no self-protection ability, Any risk can completely destroy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, if you don't go to extremes, my development will not be so fast."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the record of the past generation’s past and found it difficult to understand: “What is the use of so many low-end combat forces?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the quantity is more than a certain degree, it will become an irresistible force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is not without reason. But contrary to Richard's usual thinking, he has always created the top battle unit of the mother's nest, and then used the powerful wisdom talent to command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also because the mother nest body is accompanied by the growth of Richard, and before the wisdom talent grew up, the number of Richard’s ability to command at the same time was very limited. The army that is not jīng will affect the combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest sensation perceives what Richard thinks and says, "Master, you have thought about it. If we want to destroy a plane, what should it be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy a plane, Richard began to think seriously, and then some understand the meaning of the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the growth path of the nest, when they grow to fifteenth order, the low-end combat units that can be created are endless, as long as the food and energy are sufficient, Every day, tens of thousands of low-end fighters will walk out of the nest and head to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meaning of the mother's nest, the low end refers to the tenth grade, and this grade can already become a sharp in any known human society. Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endless massive warriors can sweep any human empire, then the mother nest can create tens of millions of worker bees and start to feed the entire plane . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in the ideal situation, the fifteenth-order mother's nest can flatten the entire plane, but if according to Richard's assumption, the fifteenth-order mother The nest can create up to 20 levels of jīng English units. The number of 20th grades is very limited, and they can't reach the level of the source of the battle as the combat energy, and it will not destroy the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this perspective, the natural instinct of the nest is to create a massive war weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has his own considerations, his vision is not limited to Greenson or Faro, just like the mother’s nest is separated from gold. The world tree is a neighbor, so giving up its own defense, the changes in the environment will affect the content of the decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard is not prepared to let the mother’s nest voluntarily act, and it seems that this Nriris did not constrain it, it was What kind of arms are provided, and what Nyris uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Richard immediately said: "Stop the creation of all existing combat units, first create 30,000 worker bees, assemble and stand by, and in terms of combat units You should have information about the crows, what is the resolution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"175%, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 175% resolution means that the crow's ability to create the crows is still above the original coffin crows, and it will be more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the 30,000 worker bees have finished, you will start to make the wood crows. Oh, don't make the landline version as it is, the level is around ten. Well, it’s called a wood war beast. How to design it, you can do it yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is somewhat uncomprehensible, asks: “Why? Make a wooden war beast, master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Because when they are large enough, they will be the main force in destroying the world tree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard chatted with his mother’s nest for a while, and he had long discovered that his mother’s nest had a sense of dú lì, now When you come up, you will be less and less controlled by the ontology, and you will have your own opinions and ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why this happens, Richard’s guess may be due to the rich life of Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspected the Golden World Tree and the Brood, Richard returned to the forward base and began to sort out his own clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked quietly beside him until Richard checked his backpack and prepared to leave, she walked to Richard and whispered: "Yes Be careful, and come back alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she no longer hides her deep concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha haha ​​smiled and said: "I just want to get a tree of life, not to pull out the world tree, there is no danger, I Now it’s a legendary mage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Nyres sighed and stared at Richard’s eyes and said, “But I feel bad. I always feel that you will have some accidents when you go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The accident is normal, isn't it, how can it all go well?&quot;<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to Richard, Nyris no longer insisted, but only watched the figure of Richard go away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
