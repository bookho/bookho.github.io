			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the core issue that Richard carefully prepared, and heard the Duke ask However, Richard’s heart was rather settled. He also put down the teacup and smiled and said: "What you betray is only the face gods, not the Faro plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very unexpected for the Duke answer. Although he belongs to the ancestor worship in his faith, he is naturally hostile to the true god belief, but in essence he is on the same road. The ancestor worship, in the final analysis, is to let the ancestors or the strong people in the contemporary family embark on the road of the gods. When someone ignites the fire, it turns into the true god belief. Therefore, even the Duke of Bibi, from the bottom of his heart, recognizes the status of the gods, and he just does not want to give up his dignity and interests for the god without blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are above all else, this is almost the consensus of the Faro plane, and it is also the original position of all the gods who have the position and have not yet been involved in the plane war. Consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the Duke’s questioning, Li said: “The so-called gods are the priests who have achieved their own rules. The rules are attached to the plane. And belong to the plane of the plane. The gods born by the rules can be regarded as the locusts that are parasitic on the rules. They are just like the human beings. They are only the appendages of the plane, how can they be above the plane? Above, the gods only start from their own self-interest, and they will preach themselves above the plane. From another perspective, when the plane is destroyed, the gods attached to the plane will be destroyed, and when When the gods are destroyed, the plane can still exist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke knows a lot, as a very ambitious family helm, his knowledge Absolutely unexpected to most people, but Richard's insights have never been heard and never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Faro plane of the gods, any public question of the status of the true God will be the reason for being sent to the fire. Although the Duke’s position is hostile to the gods, it can actually be regarded as an internal struggle in the same camp. The depths of the Duke’s heart also recognize that the gods should be high above, even above the entire Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after careful consideration, the Duke discovered that Richard’s words had an irrefutable truth. In the teachings of the gods, there is a common treatment for such irrefutable words. That is, no matter whether Richard is right or wrong, sending him directly to the firearm is simply not giving him a chance. I will not engage in any debate with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke tapped the coffee table and finally looked up: "This is a very difficult decision anyway. Maybe before you make a decision, you need to be in the balance again. Add a small weight. Come, come with me, I will take you to see someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cas and Oral are stayed at the meeting In the living room, only Richard and the quicksand were allowed to leave with the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke walked with them along the maze-like passage, and there were always guards who walked out from the hidden posts and saluted the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deep Rock Castle is also the residence of the Dukes, but the interior is not comfortable at all, but the whole fortress is completely. There is only a separate courtyard on the upper level of the castle. There is a five-storey building in the house, which is home to the family of the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal times, the Duke’s people are more willing to spend time in the beautiful scenery and the beautiful countryside, rather than staying in the castle like a fortress. . Only the Duke lived in the castle for many years, and only a short time in a year would accompany his family to the mountains to hunt and take the opportunity to participate in some necessary social activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
