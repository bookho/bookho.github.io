But because the hand was shaking too much, I couldn't have a sword, and I had to grind my teeth and then waved the second and third swords. A bunch of flesh and blood was lost on the ground. Cocoa whispered and fell backwards, already fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody scene makes Winnington and Winika look pale and some signs of vomiting. It’s much better, but the little face has changed. Faschi frowned and didn't say anything. The three knights of Gordon are as calm as they are, as if they were only watching the killing of chickens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee waved his hand and let the guards pull the cocoa and Irvine down, and then let the blood of the study be cleaned up. At the desk, pick up the second one you prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi finally couldn’t help but ask: "Lee, why not directly destroy the family? Isn’t it much simpler? It’s the most killing in front of him. He can also make him suffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "Miss Fassi, the family is just a weakness of Irvine, but It is by no means the biggest weakness. He is the only person who thinks about it at the crucial moment. He is obedient, just to live. If he really considers his family, he will not betray. From the soldiers of the branch family. Even in the most chaotic time, only one-third of the real looting robbery is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi sighed and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information in the handle of the hand was given to the three knights, which is a list of the soldiers and stepping knights who participated in the riots and robberies. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the first evils, they need to be executed. But now the situation is not stable, it has to be done neatly, and the people who wait and see have no chance to move, so only Can you please three of them," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris quickly browsed the list and said, "Fifty-six people, um, take five minutes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "Well, I am waiting here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three knights push the door, after a while, one The long screams echoed over the floating island. Then there is the second and third sounds. Some are just two syllables in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s nearing dusk, the sunset is like blood, and it’s covered with more than half of the sky. The murderousness and blood of the floating islands are constantly emerging, faintly intertwined with the evening glow of the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood finally washed away the chaos on the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, along with the orbit, from the floating island of the Joseph family, you can see the floating island of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of the castle, the Duke of Old Joseph and Raymond sit together and look down on the floating island of the volcano. In their eyes, it seems that a column of blood is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Joseph said helplessly: "I didn't expect Gotton to leave, but Richard is back. This little guy is decisive, and the means are hot, no more than How much is the difference between the songs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the room was pleasant, and Raymond was sitting in a large armchair with a thick blanket under his knees and no blood on his face. He stared at Archimonde's floating island and sighed after a moment, saying: "Lee is much harder to deal with than I expected. He is now a royal architect, and he wants to make a family with him later. There will be a lot. And I don't know what method he used. He can actually let the Eternal Dragon Temple shelter. Although it is only one year, it is long enough. Now in Faust, we have no way to deal with him directly."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph said slowly: "But this civil strife still caused the Akmon family to be badly hurt. There are many sacrifices from the floating island. It’s in our hands. Now the family’s sacrifices are enough for three low-level sacrifices, and I’m going to use them all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where?" Raymond asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Joseph sighed heavily and said, "Use it in the family plane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This has already given up on the sacrifice to confront Richard. The struggle since then has become hard and long, and it is full of unpredictable changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s face passed a strange fainting sigh and said: “I really hope to play with the guy in Richard’s plane war. Field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be opportunities!" said Old Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they all know that the opportunity is really embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, Emperor Philip’s afternoon tea is just coming to an end. In another half hour, I went to dinner again. As the emperor emperor, Philip's time is very tight, early, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, supper, plus meals, these projects crowded the timetable, people really sigh, eating is also very Hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of food are filled with a long table of five meters, and Niris is sitting opposite to eat. He was chatting with his father while eating, and he has already played his talents in this area. But Philip's belly seemed to have a bottomless space, and large pieces of food were thrown directly into the throat and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris sweeps the speed of food, the fastest is one-third of Phillips. If Richard is on the side, he will understand why Niris can talk while he is not delaying eating. It is really a poor living environment to exercise. Even so, in front of Philip, Nyris can't grab much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Emperor’s meal, eating less is a must, but even more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe looked out of the window, and Archon’s 7-2 floating island was slowly sliding from below. The volcanic features on the floating island are too obvious and are essentially different from other floating islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The little guy in Richard has already started? The temper is still a little anxious!" said Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris said: "He is anxious to return to the Faro plane, where there is still a graceful grace. I heard that the time flow rate is Nolan. "One tenth of Germany."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are too anxious, you will often overlook some important things around you." Phillips said something meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris thought about the meaning of Philip's words, but there was no result. He still felt that wasting time was a waste of God's grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Niris and Philip talked about the treatment of the Royal Royal Builder. When talking about the exchange ratio of each set of materials exchanged with Richard for a set of suits, he couldn’t help but be a little excited. He said, "Hey, Luno’s guy has become more and more disappointing these years. Now there are Richard, the cost of adding a knight is the same as that of the other two empires. However, if this exchange ratio is maintained, Richard seems to have suffered a loss. Father, do you mean to train Richard as soon as possible? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lose?" Philippe snorted twice and swallowed a large piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris frowned, why didn’t he understand what he said wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Phillips said: "I heard that there was a rebellion in the Greenson plane that Akmon had just occupied. Before Richard returned to the Faro plane Most of the time, I have to deal with this matter first. If you can, you can go to the Greenson plane with him, and fight and see for a long time. Young people, go to the eccentric plane and walk around." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." Nyris always used tribute to Philip when he accepted the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what preparations did Richard make before returning to the Faro plane?" Philip asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris quickly sorted out the information in his head and said: "He brought back the enchanted cloud iron ingot worth one million gold coins, all for the eternal The Dragon Hall deducted the grace of the gods. In addition, the six pieces were brought back and all the promises were transferred to the royal family. However, except for a small amount of rare magic materials, the rest of the money was required to be paid in standard standard enchanted weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called boutique, that is, attached two enchanting effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Niris’s words, Philip thought for a moment and said, “It seems that Faro is rich in resources, but the magical civilization is far behind Nolan. De. This kid is very clever. He knows that the most fundamental way to strengthen his strength through the plane is not war, but trade. War is only a means of guaranteeing transactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The afternoon tea time is over, and another ten minutes is dinner time. Philip waved and let Nyris leave and said, "Go and prepare. When you go to the Greenson plane, remember to call Agamemnon. You may become friends after three."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floating island of 7-2, the three knights were killed like thunder. It took them only four minutes to complete the first task that they received from Richard. Most of the time was spent on the road. It was only a matter of moments to kill. An extra minute is used to review whether or not the guy on the list is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bloody hurricane on the floating island, Richard sat in the study and gently rubbed his forehead. His headache is very powerful. This is the sequela of overuse of the brain. Even with the support of wisdom and talent, it is not easy to find a clue in a complicated situation. In the days of Noland, Richard's brain remained at high speed almost all the time. A seemingly simple decision has been repeatedly pondered and reconsidered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still young and has insufficient experience. Any important decision needs to be rethought and multi-angled to make the impact of both front and back clear. Only then can a formal decision be made. Each of his decisions will involve a wide range of influences, or affect the life and death of a group of people, or involve the entry and exit of millions of gold coins. A wrong decision often requires several times the effort to make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
