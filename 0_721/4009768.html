Take a few sacrifices to the Eternal Dragon Hall. Also, don't think that you can beat Amyron and Shaf, and you can deal with other Archimonde! The two wastes are totally the shame of Archimonde. To be honest, I really regret that the distance between our territories is more than 3,000 kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled and said: "I am also very sorry! Our two territories can be linked together, and maybe there will be a Marquis collar! However, the real battlefield is in the infinite plane. I look forward to knowing the day of your exclusive plane coordinates."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice also smiled and said, "I have the same expectation. However, today's things may not be so easy to end. You have already angered Gotton, this guy Even I am a little scared. Take care of your little baron collar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, Ellie He stood up, walked outside the box. When she reached the door, she suddenly turned back and scanned all the people in the house. She said faintly: "If I were you, I would definitely go home a few times in the near future to see if something happened."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, almost all of the faces have changed except Raymond and Feren. They all understood the threat of nakedness in the words of Alice, and Fokker actually opened a very bad head. The struggle between the two giants will no longer follow the ancient aristocratic tradition. Start unscrupulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Alice walked for a long time, Raymond woke up from her meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the box is very depressed, and everyone’s face is not particularly good looking. The Joseph family has a long history. As a strongman attached to Joseph, each of them is actually equal to a small aristocrat, with more or less private industry, and even Feren and Nasimi are themselves hereditary barons. So the threat of Ellie is direct and effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of Fok’s failure is obvious. All the giants are not fools, they will be stupid enough to not see the conspiracy behind the whole thing. Don't wait until tomorrow, later today, the process of this conflict will spread to other families, including some details outside the scene, time is too hasty, they can not erase all traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, by convention, it’s the revenge of the Archimonde family. Fokker’s disability is part of the price, but it’s still not enough. He did not die, and there were reasons for Goliath to avoid trouble, and to retain further vengeance and even to play a role. This is a disguised manifestation of the aristocratic traditional revenge custom. To return a tooth, return blood to blood, until you get the equivalent price or compensation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Archimonde targets the revenge and the cost of the price to the core strength of their non-Joseph family members, that is another matter. The Duke of Joseph would have liked to see such an ending, because apart from Nasabi and Feren, no one else had followed the experience of the Joseph family for generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a viper, he is only temporarily accepting a strong man hired by the Joseph family. It is estimated that even if he died, he always thought that the core of the incident was the two deaf children. The battle between the two did not know the inside story of the whole incident. He is dead, but only let the Joseph family take out some gold coins. In the eyes of the big family, the gold coins are the least worth cherishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, these powers can be measured in a similar way for the Joseph family. Although their individual strength is called a strong person, the most important thing for the Archimonde family is the individual strong. If Archimonde is fully committed to them, none of the people present can be spared. The Joseph family is not a strong man who can compete with Goliath or even Gordon and Modred. But the problem is that they will not be dispatched for these small people outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
