The price of the magical armed forces has not yet been finalized. However, it is certain that it will also appear in the point redemption system, which is about 5,000 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who do not participate in the redemption of points, they can also get magical arms. Richard will hold an auction in the near future to publicly auction a fifth-order magical arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two are heavy news, and many of the lords immediately whispered to the assistants around them, so that they immediately wanted to get the latest set of points redemption system and items. The list comes. After the dinner is over, they have to study it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can get Midrand, even if this system is idiotic, it is also valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party ended smoothly, and some of the big lords wanted to talk to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are too many people, Richard can only arrange twenty minutes for each family. Even so, when he sends the last duke, he already The sky will be clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler has been waiting, waiting for Richard to finally be free, before handing a report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a report from Kingsley that she had all the information that Richard wanted to know and was ready to take the time to end the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked awkward and asked, "Is the cocoa awake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler said "Already awake, I am with my child. Her condition is very good. It is no different from normal. It is just that Miss Frey seems to have a weak feeling for her, and even some resist her hug." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a few days, I will bring Frey to the second round, and let her play it in a few days. Right, how much more she wants to eat?" How much to give, no need to control. In addition, I am going to see this prisoner now, you are going to call cocoa too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, Richard appeared in the dungeon. He sat facelessly on a high-backed chair, looking at the crouching prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingsley stood beside Richard and his body was even worse. She is not tired, but charming. Whenever she sees Richard, she laughs like an old dog who only sees the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the prisoner who was lying on the ground, the cocoa who just stepped into the door was shocked and lost his voice: "How... how could it be her?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This squatter is the personal maid who Coco brought from the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids have not appeared these days, but replaced by two young female mage. The argument given by Richard is that these days are very crucial and must be seen by the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, cocoa is naturally gentle and obedient. I just didn't think that the maid was actually caught in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, can't it be her?" Cocoa asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked frowning, and Kingsley said in a nightingale voice: "Miss Coco, I have never made a mistake in this regard." She can deceive me, but her soul can't deceive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the voice of Kingsley, the maid suddenly trembled and was obviously scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Coco and sighed and said, "She was you looking for it? In the past month, she sold out to the family." The intelligence has already earned 3,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco suddenly stunned and said: "This...this is impossible.... ..""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand gold coins are by no means a small amount, even her own, after getting the official status of her partner, the monthly income is only a few hundred gold coins. Other things are given by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa is not stupid, selling information can get a huge sum of three thousand gold coins, can imagine what she has sold out. And the source of intelligence, naturally, needless to say, most of it is cocoa itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa has been helping Richard to sort out documents in many cases. In this position, she can't make any decisions, but she can see most of Richard's decisions. She got along very well with this maid, and in the casual chat she said a lot of things that should not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I...sorry..." Cocoa really didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginsure laughed a few times and asked, "His Royal Highness, what do you do with the family that buys intelligence? And what about this woman?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and said, "There is always something like this. There is no need to be too serious. But you can't let them be so rampant. They must let them converge. Well, Kingsley, you filter the list of her joints, not particularly important people, let them naturally 'disappear'. As for this woman, give it to you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsley stretched out his scarlet tongue and licked his lower lip. Yīn smiled and said, "Thank you, Your Highness! This is an important reason for me to die for you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which other reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your powerful, irresistible powerful!" When saying this, The voice of Kingsley was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "It seems that you can sense the thing in my body. This is good, I know what you want." Well, you will get what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Kingsley is now sincerely grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time the maid had already understood her final destiny and was immediately scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she finally returned to God, jumped up and screamed: "His Royal Highness, no, don't do this! Forgive me, how do you beat me?" All right, don't give me to her. Cocoa sister, help me, beg you to save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa can't bear it, but eventually sigh With a sigh of relief, he said softly: "I'm sorry, this... I have a mistake, I can't help you, it's all decided by my Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid stared at the cocoa and suddenly broke out and shouted: "I just took a little bit of money, and this is what I should take. Can't you help me? Ha! You actually say this now! In order to come here, I am again. How much did you pay, you know? Your father, your brother has slept me! Now you can't help me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid Suddenly leaping to the cocoa, but she suddenly fell from the air, and then violently tumbling, the screaming call of the whole dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginsure looked at Richard and raised his hand to the maid, the voice of the maid disappeared immediately, but the pain in her did not ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco looked at Richard and seemed to want to ask for a waitress, but never dared to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a document and said, "Cocoa, I just extended the territory to your father, and there have been two successive incidents in the new territory. The incident of killing the people. It is said that the reason is that you are disrespectful to your brother, and there are many cases where you have to go to the caravan, conflict with the neighboring regional lords, etc. In addition, your father is also planning to set up in the territory. The checkpoints are taxed to the caravans. There is a main road leading to the Black Rose Castle. They think that I have given too little money and territory, so I plan to bring taxes to my head?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is impossible..." Coco suddenly felt that his whole body had lost his strength, and his legs were soft and he sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and lifted her to the seat and said, "You said, what does this kind of thing do for me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa sobbed in a low voice and couldn’t speak. After she was determined to be pregnant, her father, her brother, and a large variety of relatives came to the door and asked for money to demand the title. Especially those relatives, there are many cocoa and have never seen each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother is also very dissatisfied with Richard, often saying that cocoa has to have children, and how should Richard give him an earl, and the result is now Just gave the coco's father a jazz. Outside, her brother did a lot of things in the name of Cocoa and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa has been worried that if these things are known to Richard, I don’t know what the consequences will be. However, now Richard not only knows, but her brother has also made more outrageous things. He killed the people, just to disrespect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are different from the slaves. The general lord has no good reason and will never arbitrarily kill the people. Moreover, it is the father of cocoa, nor the lord of complete dú lì. Without trial, he did not have the right to kill the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard walked back and forth in the room, and the old man next to him also lowered his head. These things should have been reported by him, but he was forced to press down. As a result, I did not expect that there would be incidents of killing the people and blackmailing the caravan. After the big trouble, I passed it to other places from other sources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has gone through dozens of laps, which may be tricky for him than conquering the entire plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally made up his mind and said, "Cocoa, they are your family, I will take care of it. So, recruit your brother into the army." Go to the Golden Valley. As for your father, the title and territory are still reserved, but the taxation rights are turned over and the funds are subsidized from me. Just like this, in addition, there will be similar incidents in the future, I don’t want them. Will be deducted in the middle of the road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa finally breathed a sigh of relief. This punishment is much more relaxed than it should be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler came over and sent the cocoa out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cocoa leaves, Kingsley just eats and laughs and says, "Your Highness, you are still too kind."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro, the initial place, the silence and tranquility here have been broken, and a team of fighters are marching into the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian tribes along the way are either annihilated or conquered and moved outside the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not destroy the circle that extracted the power of the plane, so the barbarians on the ancestral highlands still had the invisible shackles. Richard has already seen that if there is no such shackle, the barbarian will easily rise to the 13th and 4th grades, which can be regarded as a high-ranking warrior even in Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breaking through the ancestral highlands, Richard became the enemy of all barbarians. He does not want to let his potential enemies break through the limits of the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, a few giant cornices are slowly moving, they are loaded with some supplies, but mainly carrying worker bees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
