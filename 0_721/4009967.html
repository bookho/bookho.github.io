			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard slid a piece of oil on the wall, The middle-aged aristocrats of unknown origin finally couldn’t help but talk: "It’s a young man! You are not afraid of war, can other people be afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李笑笑Laugh, said: "You finally said what you meant. Let me guess, who wants to give me a war... If I have not guessed wrong, should the owner behind you be the highland unicorn visor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged aristocrat’s face changed and he snorted and stopped talking. He is also a wise man, the main battlefield is not here, and now angering Richard has no benefit to him personally. And he is also desperately trying to figure out which part of the link has been leaked, so that Richard can think of the highland unicorn viscount so quickly. If the Duke of the Wolf receives the wind before killing Richard, things will become very tricky. Pulling on a vassal of the Lord and then attacking another vassal, this is not something that can be put on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the highland unicorn viscount is a special existence. If Richard is a dead person, the situation will be completely different. The justice of war is always the winner. To write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the game ends here. My time is precious, bring my people out! Otherwise, my mood will get worse. Licha said indifferently, while raising his hand and making a stroke, a loud bang, and a crack in the center of the oil painting worth thousands of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baron uncle glared at Richard, and then ordered the guard to bring the person up immediately. After a few minutes, Pierce, who was hurt, was dragged up, and he couldn’t walk on his own. Richard learned the art of the dark world and saw that Pierce was detained for a few days and was very tortured. Pierce’s two followers were tormented even more embarrassed, and if there were no sands, they were likely to leave some disability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards have brought Pierce as soon as possible, but in just a few minutes, nearly 10,000 gold coins have disappeared into the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Pierce, Richard is completely silent, just telling Oral to ask people to carry them out of the castle. Then Richard stood up and said goodbye to the little baron and his uncle. From the beginning to the end, Richard was not angry, not surprised, and said nothing, even the obvious injuries on Pierce did not ask. The more this is the case, the more chilled the uncle of the baron, the idea that he wanted to bully and insult Richard through Pierce has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard is leaving, he can't help but stand up and want to pull the bell. But when I saw the ‘elderly’ guards in the living room, he finally recognized the reality and did not do anything stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the living room, Richard stopped and said a little: "It is impossible to get out of the Duke's sequence without paying the price." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the dusk castle, Olal gathered around Richard and asked: "Adult, the family of the little baron treats you like this, you are not angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Angry? Why are you angry?” Richard always has a faint smile and says, “It’s useless to get angry. We just kill them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the camp, Richard immediately prepared for the army. Since the Viscount Heim wants to give Richard a war, he will certainly not wait for Richard to fix the castle. In fact, the action of the Viscount was much faster than that predicted by Richard. It seems that the Viscount has a few abilities in addition to his madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce is one of the only two left-handed knights. Fortunately, after the treatment of quicksand, the injuries that may leave hidden dangers are eradicated. In the next few days, Marvin and Kas will treat him. Although the two fallen priests are not good at treatment, the priest ranks enough and the treatment is still used. Richard is now squatting in the middle and lower ranks of officers, they are the mainstay of an army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took out the equipment purchased from the Duke and armed more than a hundred Shamin Knights. After the leather armor was replaced by a lock, and the ordinary sabre was replaced by a long-handed machete forged by steel, the combat power of the Shamin cavalry went straight to a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage to the Sequoia Kingdom was blocked by Baron Xiaofang Dan. Richard was unable to get supplies and urgently needed soldiers from the Sequoia Kingdom. Of course, Send a message to Deep Rock City. However, Richard did not intend to ask for help from the Duke of the Wolf at this stage. The Lord of the Moon, who had to wait for half a month in the defense of the Baron of the Dandan to wait for the recruitment of the recruits, seemed to have withdrawn in advance, and was actually received by the Baron. For the sake of blindness, there are still other reasons. Richard is not thinking about it at present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing at the moment is to win the next war that is imminent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the camp in Richard’s camp has been rising steadily. Every three days, a group of nine throwing soldiers will join the team of Richard. After destroying almost all of the magic crystals of Richard, the mother's nest can now create three throwing soldiers or six ordinary wind teeth every day, or four heads with poisonous teeth. From the perspective of war, the role of throwing soldiers is more than that of the wind, so Richard began to make the nest's endless supply of throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mother's nest upgraded its feeding ability, the energy reserve suddenly became extremely abundant, and almost no consumption of more than half occurred. This made Richard somewhat curious, and what was eaten in the nest that wandered alone in the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mother's nest, time is on the side of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the number of the viscounts of Heim is indeed fast enough, and Richard has not waited for another batch of nine-throwing squadrons, and an army of more than a thousand people borrowed The land of blood and blood, appeared in less than fifty kilometers from the territory of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wind tooth that swam in the blood-stained area, and Richard quickly figured out the composition of this unprecedentedly large army. The troops included fifty riding elite heavy cavalry and one hundred and fifty riding light cavalry, as well as nearly one hundred archers. In addition, they were all infantry. This is a well-constructed army. So far, the most complete team that Richard has ever encountered, if the commanding general is experienced, then it is very difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for equipment, the army of the highland unicorn Viscount will never lack equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s current army is less than two hundred people. The only certain advantage is that Richard’s strongman will definitely overwhelm his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of this size can try to occupy a baron collar. This shows that in the encounter with the blood-stained land, how much shadow Richard has left on him, so that the viscount suddenly used the army, knowing that the more people are dispatched, the more the aftercare work Not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that day, Richard had investigated the Viscount of Hem, and got more detailed information from the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland Unicorn Viscount Heim does have a arrogant qualification, and Richard guessed well that day, most of the value of the Viscount is concentrated in His Majesty. Root something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
