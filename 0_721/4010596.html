			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After processing all the things in the life tree, the tree of life is again The tree opens a passage and sends Richard into the heart of the tree. Richard has just learned a lot of plane rules, and it takes time to consolidate digestion. But Richard, who has sixth-order wisdom, absorbs rules more quickly than other strong ones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last promotion, Richard could only stay outside the heart of the tree. I didn’t expect this tree to mature in the late stage. In the heart of the tree, there is a room that can accommodate one person. The room is filled with a rich and pure natural atmosphere. At the bottom, there is a half-meter deep water, which is actually a tree-hearted slurry. At this moment, the tree of life has just completed the golden stage, and the evolution of the tree heart. Not completely finished, the milky white walls breathe the natural energy just like breathing. Now the heart of the tree can see crystals embedded with many fingers. It is actually the natural power that has been crystallized. The more the number of crystals, the more life. The power of the tree is stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Richard was that there was still a lot of unrecognized potential energy in the tree, so this opportunity could not be wasted, so he directly soaked Beginning to meditate in the pulp of the heart, and soon enter the space of consciousness of deep blue meditation. After a moment, Richard perceives the natural radiance around the stars, which is the superior energy for nurturing the blood of the silver moon elves, but now Li Chaka did not come for them. He directly upgraded the level of deep blue meditation, and his mental vision immediately expanded by dozens of times. The energy scanned was more advanced. In the space of consciousness, the natural radiance gradually dimmed, only the strongest The light is still shining stubbornly, but there is a new, suffocating feeling that is slowly coming to the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie suppresses the excitement in his heart and constantly enhances his spiritual strength. He is manifested in the space of consciousness, that is, he is constantly rising to the sky, and his vision has changed. It is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a huge green planet jumped out of the darkness, occupying almost all of Richard’s vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart beats violently, and then almost stagnates. This is the original strength of the Greenson plane, but it’s too big, huge Let the heart of Richard even swallowed, and the power of such a large plane is not to be swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei knows how difficult it is to absorb the power of the plane. He successfully absorbed a piece of surface power in the dusk, but at dusk The status has long since died, not far from complete destruction. The strength of the planes there is also riddled with holes, which is less than one percent of the complete period. This can be absorbed by Richard, even if it is a broken source of power, after absorption. Also formed a blood-colored broken planet around the blood, can only grind the energy inside, and now hit the full green energy source, Richard finally found that the source of strength is beyond his current ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jade planet in the field of vision is slowly getting bigger, and Richard is shocked. He finds that he is not pulling his own strength, but that the source is pulling him. If it is really colliding with this huge planet, Richard is not Determine what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly controlled his consciousness and prepared to lower the level of perceived energy. At this moment, Richard suddenly discovered that there were several stones like jade. It is slowly spinning around the planet, and one just floats in front of Richard. If it is proportional, this rock is a hill, but it is like a stone compared with the green planet, but this rock is Just within the limits of Richard's grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took the initiative and countless golden bands of light extended out, placed on the rock, slowly changing its trajectory, flying to Richard, Richard nervous At the very end, the trajectory of the giant rock is constantly calculated until the moment when it will come, and the dark blue meditation is suddenly raised to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space of consciousness suddenly expanded, and the huge rock like a hill became the size of a fist, and was swallowed by Richard. The next moment, the pain hit Li. The soul of the inspection directly blasted him out of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the tree, Li snorted and two nosebleeds flowed out. He slowly opened his eyes and took a long breath. Just now Far beyond the limit of Richard's tolerance, the result is not light, but fortunately successfully captured this source of energy, the future will be quite large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei relaxes, let the heart pulp begin to infiltrate his body, repairing the damage everywhere, the tree of the life tree is more effective than the tree of life It is much stronger, not only can cure **, but also can make up for the damage of the spirit and the soul. Richard knows that this is the deliberate appreciation of the tree of life. After all, the pulp of the heart is very precious to the tree of life, equivalent to human beings. The heart is bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a break, Richard entered the space of meditation again. This time, he saw a lot of extravagance in his own blood. The emerald-like energy crystallization is also flying around the bloodline along its own trajectory. It always releases a natural force and integrates into the blood. But what surprised Richard is that the natural power released by crystallization is Spirituality, actually will take the initiative to avoid the capture of Akmon's blood, mostly absorbed by the five bloody life trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a moment, Richard has understood that the smallest unit of Greenson’s plane strength should be as big as that planet, but only a large number of life trees The power of the source has shredded many of its original strengths. This is cheaper for Richard. It is precisely because the power of the source has been broken that a strong group of people can take the opportunity to touch and understand the rules of the plane. Otherwise, it is less than the legendary realm. It is impossible to get such a huge source of power, which is why the legendary strong can touch the rules of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard finally gave birth to the realization that the legend does not pose a big obstacle to himself. This is because the real talent gives Richard a pair of eyes that can see the illusory world and insight into the source. Richard can see the flow of energy at the bottom. It is possible to parse the rules until this time, the real talents begin to show its true power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this insight, Richard began to observe the newly acquired source power. From the perspective of releasing energy, this source of power crystallizes more than the other two planets. More, Richard silently calculated that he would be promoted to the 19th level in about a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 18th to the 20th, there is no new magic to learn, no new ability, more is the magic savings, as the impact of the legendary realm Preparation, between each level, the required magic span is getting bigger and bigger, and the promotion is more and more difficult. Now Richard is not eager to improve the magic, he is promoted too fast, so that there is still a lot of ability without perfection. For example, the real powerful magic of the eighth grade or above, Richard has not had time to conduct in-depth analysis, the magic power of the master is still in the original stage, and his blood ability needs to be improved, but the blood boost needs to compete with the magic for meditation energy. There is always a need to give up between the two. In the end, Richard also scored a lot of time on the construction. This is his fundamental, but also needs to pay off debts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sound of the tree of life sounded: "Master, you end the meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded and said: "Well, the harvest is not small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more thing that needs you to decide." The tree of life says, just in the tree The walls of the ventricle suddenly release a large amount of original energy, and a lot of emerald essence puree is dripped from the top of the room, and these original energy are integrated into one, and finally turned into a translucent jade ball, floating in Richard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the extra source energy I collected when I was promoted. I could only use it to condense the essence of Wanmu, but after the promotion I mastered it. There are a lot of plane rules that have control over it. Now there are several options that you can choose based on your will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next green The ball of light is constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop-shaped emerald gem is the essence of Wanmu, which can open the soul power. This is the last time that Richard used it. If the tree of life does not say, Li It was almost forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
