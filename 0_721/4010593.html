			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the root of the resentment of the four emperors is still in strength, when Nyris When Agamemnon was in front of the sanctuary, the strength of the two men was basically the same. If it was a battle, because of the flexible and varied style, Nyres’s face was bigger, and then Agamemnon was in the field. The battlefield was promoted to the sanctuary, and Nyris was born for more than half a year. It was a place where he was proud of the smashing of the sanctuary. However, the problem was that Agamemnon’s strength has been growing rapidly since entering the sanctuary. When Nyris also entered the sanctuary, Agamemnon, who took the first step, had already opened the gap with Nyris in power. Nyris’s Thunder Destroyer was very arrogant, and he believed that he would defeat Aga under the same strength. The chances of the doorman are always bigger, but now Agamemnon is not the same strength as him, but he is deeper than him, so that Nyris is losing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Richard...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon agree that Richard has It is a metamorphosis that cannot be measured by rank. Although it has not really been played, they all feel that there will be no pleasant ending in confrontation with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Nyris still has some unsuccessful feelings, but once Richard has been running for a battle, there is really no time to cut it with him. Second, Agamemnon He also told Niris that Richard’s strength in the late battlefield was stronger than he is now. At that time, Richard was not a big magician. The meaning of Agamemnon’s words is that you are now I can't even beat it, I still want to go to Richard to single out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just a small episode. In the past years, Richard has rushed all the way, and Nyris and Agamemnon are not idle, except In the investment of the Greenson plane, Nyris got a private plane from the royal family. He also bought a newly discovered plane with Agamemnon. Now they have successfully opened the situation in the new plane. The base has been built, and the roots have been firmly established. With the support of the stratified resources, Nyres or Agamemnon now has a decent army. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current tens of thousands of people, there are more than 2,000 private troops belonging to Nyris and Agamemnon, belonging to the royal family and the Duke of Iron There are more than a thousand people, and the rest are Richard’s troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is low, and the camp is full of fire, the burning flame not only heats the meal, but also expels the damp, provides heating, even in the cold and wet forest The soldiers under Richard’s can also sleep in warm and dry bedding. This kind of rock-wood fuel needs only a small piece to burn all night. A soldier can carry it with a month of rock fuel. If you can eat well and sleep well, then even if you continue to march and fight for a month, there will be no decline in the strength of the army. If you are in a difficult environment or lack of supplies, you can overcome these difficulties with a strong will, but always It will have a significant impact on the combat effectiveness of the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of inspections, Richard found that the role of rock-wood fuel was much larger than expected. This seems to be a small improvement, but it has greatly improved the environment in which the soldiers are located. This time, the road was opened in the forest. The experience also allowed Richard to re-examine the use of gunpowder and think about whether it could be used in other aspects. After Richard decided to return to Noland, he immediately tried to increase the production of dwarf gunpowder and rock wood combustion agent, but in the short term How can Richard find a way, and there will be no substantial increase in production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Nyris and Agamemnon also saw the benefits of rock wood fuel, each ordered dozens of tons from Richard, no need More is not because they can't afford it, but because there is so much production. Most of the current reserves have been transported to Greensun by Richard, and they are consumed in these marches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the army returned to the base city, and after a simple rest, it began to slash and expand the road that was opened during the march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, the Golden World Tree has grown a second new leaf. When the second new leaf grows, the entire Greenson plane vibrates again. A new leaf represents the birth of the golden world tree, and the second new leaf means that the field of the golden world tree is initially formed. In the core field of the golden world tree, all natural forces will be manipulated by it if it does not Agree that even the tree of life can't grow, even though the golden world tree at this time is just a small sapling with two leaves growing, outside the core field, it is the secondary field. In the secondary field, the golden world tree can Applying a certain influence, as it grows, the area of ​​the secondary field will not only expand, but the impact that can be exerted will become stronger and stronger. In the future, when the golden world tree continues to grow, it will be outside the secondary field. A derivative field has emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core area of ​​the Golden World Tree now has a radius of one kilometer, while the limit of the secondary field is a radius of one hundred kilometers. When Richard knows this data, Can not help but sigh the natural power of the Golden World tree, in the era of the Elven Empire, the Golden World tree can be used as the seat of Wang Ting, not comparable to the ordinary world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sphere of the world tree of the Golden World tree, the influence of the forest will is weakened to the extreme, in fact there is another forest will in the field, that is The will of the golden world tree, as long as it is in the field, the suppression of the will of the golden world tree is even more powerful than the forest will, and the forest will is obviously weakened in the vicinity of the field. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of bird-eaters from the nest of the hens are now nearly fully developed, and the number of worker bees manufactured by the nest is more than 2,500. Richard felt that the time was ripe, and it was time for the tree of life to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Li Chazhi is sure to win. He not only mobilized three hundred knights, but also screened out two thousand elite and loyal warriors, and went to the location of the tree of life. On the strong side, Richard not only left all the Followers and Nolan's great priests also temporarily transferred Summa and Oral to Greenson. Although the elf poet is still stuck in the sanctuary, he can't play in this battlefield, but the role played on this battlefield is not much smaller than the combat priest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is ready, Richard finally let the tree of life formally begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the soldiers have built simple but solid fortifications around the tree of life, and sprinkled rock powder burning powder in the outer trenches, the knight They are concentrated in the tree of life, they will be responsible for dealing with the most dangerous and urgent situation. The guardian tribe originally brought by the tree of life has been withdrawn from the tree, leaving only the most elite shooters and Druid, Yongye tribe The surviving Druids and hunters were also transferred and were responsible for the canopy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worker bees who were separated from their nests rushed into the soil and began a three-day dormancy, leaving only one hundred worker bees to continue collecting food, when the sleeping worker bees When waking up, the tree of life will also complete the preparations in the early stage and formally enter the middle stage of the mature period. Within about half a day or one day, various natural enemies will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the time of the tree of life is coming, the giant wood is constantly shaking and begins to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye. The whole growth process will last for several days. During this time, the tree of life will become very fragile, and the natural enemies will come from the source. For the tree of life, each step is a test of life and death. In the past, it is a new stage of life. If it passes, it will turn into gray. Mud, it will take a long time for a new tree of life to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of bird-eater spiders are ready, they are densely covered with trunks and branches, although many of the guardian tribes have seen the bird before Spiders, but this time the number is really too much, still let them shudder, the tree of life is big, but after climbing tens of thousands of bird-eaters, there is not much space left, whether the guardian elves or the eternal Night elves, inevitably encounter and even step on the bird-eater spider when walking through, the character of the bird-eater spider is unexpectedly tamed, even if it is stepped on, there is no reaction, but even then, the elves will still have a cold sweat, especially This is especially true for the hunters of the Eternal Night Elf. They have never seen a bird-eater spider, and secondly, they intuitively know how dangerous these giant spiders are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the half-day of the life tree began to emerge, the first natural enemies finally appeared in the distant sky: the wood crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
