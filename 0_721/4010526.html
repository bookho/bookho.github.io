Asked the Duke of Soram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke at the moment stood up and looked down on the generals and advisers who were thinking hard. This tall and remote war room also has a history of nearly a thousand years. The generation of Soram is here to expand the family's territory, and the title has also been promoted from the Viscount to the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This generation of Duke himself is a legendary strongman, invisibly raising the family’s prestige again, if not a few years ago, Stevenson was rushed from the dark blue When I come back, the family’s reputation may be even higher. Another embarrassment is that the Duke of Soram did not really win once in a direct and indirect war with Alice, a few victories, because it was Ai. Lily took the initiative to retreat, and it is hard to say that it is a real victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the stain on the reputation of the Soram family has been associated with Archimonde in the past decade, and now, Richard actually came again. So, the face of Soram can't help but be gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bearded general got up and said: "In my opinion, Richard wants to sneak into the area, bypassing the area where we are heavily stationed, and inserting The key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another older magician said something yin and yang: "What are the key points that Richard wants to raid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was a stagnation, and some of them could not answer. Richard’s strength had long been detailed, and everyone had a copy in front of him. The numbers inside can be quickly recited. So few troops are all elite. Of course, they want to run lightly. The question is where is Richard's goal, the city, the Duke Castle, or the mine port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So careful, this general found it difficult to judge where Richard’s squadron was, but under the gaze of the Duke’s gaze, he could not Do not answer, so hard to scalp: "I think the Isoria magic crystal vein is the target of Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician sneered a few times Slowly said: "A great magister, a big builder, will lack the magic crystal, what does he do in the mine, can he still hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you said what Richard wants to do." The general was degraded and immediately roared like a red-eyed bullfight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician said for a long time, but did not fall on the focus, and finally the Duke had to interrupt his long story, and then others published Insights, basically speaking the important areas of the Duke, and many people think that Richard is staring at Soram’s costume knight, and intends to reinvent the Duke’s Knights. This view has been won by many people. I agree, even Soram also secretly nodded, and my heart is calculating that the opponent should be slightly. After all, the Knights of the Front are now known as the knights of the knights. Their fame is rising, and the limelight is even more powerful than the powerful Maple Oak Knights and the Knights of the White Knights. Be taller, after all, the high-ranking knights in the two Knights will not be able to squint at the sight of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic discussion soon has a new direction, a general said: "We must put all the knights together to form one The elite, but larger-sized troops, after determining the whereabouts of Richard, no matter where Richard attacked, the defenders there will hold him, so that we can attack with all our strength and fight with him on the battlefield. Always the most crucial factor, since he came up with the limelight, let us teach him a sly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Soram nodded and looked on the map. Moving back and forth on each strategic point, Shen Shen said: "The defenders want to drag Richard, the number is too small, but you can see how many scales are appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The generals of the generals have talked a lot, and finally felt that relying on the guards of several cities, then 10,000 troops are enough. These cities have defensive facilities. The knights can jump directly on the high walls of tens of meters. The Cavaliers can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle plan was negotiated, and the Duke immediately issued an order to allow the newly reorganized troops to be stationed in different locations, while he himself and the followers were in the town, the Duke Mobilized a full five thousand elite cavalry, 10,000 elite infantry, and one hundred and fifty riding knights, formed an elite force, waiting for the moment of decisive battle with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Solam never understood what Richard wanted to do. He suddenly launched the war. Is this young man fighting for war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soram learned about Richard from Stevenson, knowing that he was very calm and rigorous from a very young age, such a person is sure It won't be impulsive, then what is he for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke revisited the map. When his eyes passed over the Great St. Louis Temple, his heart suddenly moved, but then he threw the idea aside. A temple, everything in the eyes of believers, but for others, what? neither. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Duke was meditating, there was a sudden footstep outside, and a guard rushed into the war room at full speed, adding a blood-stained An urgent letter was sent to the Duke's hand. Soram quickly opened the envelope. After reading it for a while, his face suddenly changed. He whispered: "Licha has already arrived in Cork Town."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cork Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a small town, still a short distance from the Duke of Soram, which is the cover of the Viscount Angang, not very important, but already holy The official territory of the tree dynasty, and Richard's normal should be there two days later, and as a result, Richard turned the five-day march into three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general said with a sigh: "He is crazy, the horses will run to death, even if they are all good breeds, they will become exhausted."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Richard, will you fight?" A staff member’s words just exported, you know that it’s wrong, Richard will certainly fight, very, and Definitely more than he will play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke heard the noisy voice of everyone, his heart suddenly rushed into a irritating, and said: "Enough, give me a quiet."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode to the map and looked carefully, and suddenly he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, one of the generals at the same time also thought of it, lost the voice: "The 3rd Infantry Regiment is going to pass behind the town of Cork, they are in Richard On the way forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke’s face was very gloomy, and a light infantry regiment with less than 10,000 people met Richard’s elite like a wolf The knight is completely swallowed by a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the time and said in a low voice: "I’m telling them that it’s too late, I hope that the reloaded infantry of the Viscount Angang can be as powerful as he’s bragging. Well, everyone, now we need to re-plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reloaded infantry of Viscount Angang is indeed proud. They are uniformed in blue and white armor and well equipped. Well-trained, looking at the aristocratic private army, there is really not much such an elite force in the Viscount. However, when the prince Angang pulled the unit out of the military camp and placed it in front of Richard, he did not think of a The very real problem is that the number of heavy infantry is only five hundred, which is in the same order of magnitude as that of Richard’s knight. The reintegrated infantry can’t stop the impact of the knight’s, especially these. The Cavaliers also ran a five-meter-old ogre lord in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, "Ten Tons" played its power in Noland. With a single blow, more than a dozen heavy infantrymen were flying. The squadron of the heavily loaded infantry, which was carefully crafted by the Viscounts, was directly dispersed. Thousands of light-duty private troops were even more unbearable. After being trampled back and forth by the knight, the knight was completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha rides on the unicorn and does not participate in the battle, but looks at the battle at the side, and by his side, there are also 500 knights Many followers did not participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and asked, "That person is the Viscount of Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the direction of his fingers, a gorgeous middle-aged aristocrat is roaring and attacking the ogre. His body is shining, only one step away from the sanctuary. The sword and courage are equally outstanding, but unfortunately, under despair The Viscount chose the wrong target. Tiramisu is already a twentieth-level ogres lord. The "ten tons" is not his enchanting sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu slaps the viscount from the horseback to the ground, then swings the hammer and blasts the viscount’s guards like a fly. Then he picked up the Viscount and came to Richard's horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, this kid looks like the lord here, and we will win it," Tiramisu asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Of course, I won, I will bring the Viscount and let him go with us. There is still some time on the road. He can write a letter." Letter to the family and confirm the ransom that should be paid to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ransom, I like ransom, head." The ogres have both heads open. Smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the knight who was still chasing the crash, raising his voice: "All returning to the team, taking half an hour, starting half an hour later, ready to fight." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, there are enemies." The ogre was very excited, and the battle just did not even warm up for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One...small fish." Richard examined the message from the consciousness and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre scratched his head and looked at the Viscount Angang next to him, muttering and said: "Small fish is a small fish, always better than this Fish is strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
