			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the desire for many years has been possible, even the powerful Thunder Hammer Some people couldn’t wait any longer. When he listened to the attached small condition, he immediately said: "In the bloody stone forest in the west of the Bloodstone Camp, there is a powerful beast named Xu Ying, which is a mutant wolf. It’s terrible. My two most powerful sons have died under his claws, and I, Thunder Hammer, is only as powerful as it is, and can’t kill it at all! I need more powerful power to Kill it completely! And I am now at the peak of my life. After another year or two, my combat power will begin to drop, and then I will kill it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refers to the half-orc warriors on both sides, Richard said: "You have many warriors, why not form an army to kill it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder Hammer sighed and said: "Xun Ying is very embarrassed, its wisdom is not worse than ours. If I am alone , then it will accept my challenge. But if I go with the warriors of the tribe, then it will hide, even the rogue who is best at tracking the trail can not find, and the terrain of Shilin is very suitable for it to fight, it will In the most unexpected time, and launched an attack, the most elite warriors of our Bloodstone tribe can't stop its full blow. Over the years, whether we organize our own coffers or rewards from outsiders, we can't get rid of them. It, but it treats it as its own granary, and when it is dry or severe winter, it comes to the camp to hunt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called elite warriors of the Bloodstone tribe are all fighters with a level of 10, which means that they are similar to those of Richard. Of course, fighting really is another matter. The difference between Noland and the secondary plane is omnidirectional, and the combat skills and training methods exceed the two major levels of the secondary plane. Richard's team is well-matched, most of them are professionals with strong special ability. If there is a battle with a bloodstone tribe warrior composed solely of the same rank of comrades, then even a pair of two can win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the difference in physical strength between the two sides is not so obvious, and they can strike a shadow of a bloodstone tribal elite warrior, and also have a blow to kill Richard. Ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been indulging for a moment and said: "If I only upgrade to the equivalent of fifteenth-level combat power, and it is a state of fighting excitement, maybe I can help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder hammer eyes brightened and said loudly: "Even if it is only temporarily activated! As long as the effect lasts for ten minutes, no, five minutes will be fine! What do you need, sir? Hey, not just the magic material for making equipment, anything! The deal, what do you need to complete this transaction!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lie leaned on the back of the chair and looked very relaxed. He said: "I need a lot of things, including a large number of fighters, slaves, horses, all kinds of basic equipment, magic materials, special minerals, from the ancestors. The special materials of the source highland, as well as the map of the blood-stained land and the map of the various forces, the more detailed the better. These are the purpose of my blood-stained land. How much can you come up with the transaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder hammer meditation moment Solemnly said: "We have some magic materials accumulated, including ore, but because no one knows how to use it, so always put it there, you can choose freely. As for the warrior, I can lend you 20 powerful fighters. Maps I also have detailed maps of the surrounding areas of the Bloodstone Camp. The farther places are not so fine. However, can I listen to your thoughts and prepare to improve my combat power? Magic armor, or a powerful scroll?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
