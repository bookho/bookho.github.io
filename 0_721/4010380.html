Io is extremely angry about Nai's remarks, almost It’s low: “But the grace of those sacrifices has gone beyond the need for the returning sands to return the debts, but now let you say that it’s impossible for the quicksands to owe them, let alone you and me. "I want to upgrade the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nei sighed and said, "You think, even if I don't say, the Sands adults will use these sacrifices." Do you want her to use these sacrifices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... but also." Io also sighed, not for himself. But for the sake of sand, he took a moment and smiled bitterly: "What about our upgrade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie faintly said: "This plane The sacrifices are very rich, let's grab it ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it yourself." Io, a glimpse, this is something he never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, dare not go, if you dare not go, then stay here to raise, I go." Naiyou said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel stunned for a while, suddenly biting his teeth: "Go, why not go, big deal, go back to that place."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nairy shrugged and said, "That's good, but we can't just go, I will go and see Tiramisuken refuse to go with us."<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I changed." Naiyou smiled and asked, her facial features are actually very beautiful, when I laughed, the strange atmosphere is much thinner, still very very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Io is very certain that he knows how terrible Nye is in that place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie Yu suddenly pointed to the outside and said with a smile: "Look, how good the sun is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she did not wait for the answer from Iraq and Russia, and she stretched out her hand to open the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle sergeant who was left in the same place, said in a foggy way: "How good the sun is, how good the sun is."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has forgotten that place is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upstairs, the sand has closed the door, huddled freely on the sofa, fell asleep, she has not really fell asleep for several days, today Finally, she can sleep. At this time, she didn't know what dreams she had. When she fell asleep, her mouth was filled with laughter, but there were two crystal drops of water sliding down her cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard has appeared in the dusk, and it is still a very complicated tunnel, but after the last experience, Richard knows that it is already No longer safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully around, the backhand shot on the knife on his back, a slamming sound, the short blade of the barbaric slaughter fell into his hands Richard took the short knife and distinguished the direction. He walked along the underground passage. The passage was still the same. There was no change, but Richard now knows that even after this has undergone earth-shaking changes, the passage Time will still turn into what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the source of the plane to repair itself, but the source of the plane is dead, it does not know what should be repaired now, what can be laissez-faire, but by instinct Restoring everything that can be repaired, but like the residual candle in the wind, the more blazing it burns, the faster it will run out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked forward and held the five fingers of the knife and continued to relax and adjust the posture of the knife. He suddenly realized that the original knife had the same The big knowledge is, then, magic, is there more room to play, hundreds of super magic effects, and he learned how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint glow in the channel, and Richard’s footsteps are constantly echoing. His gaps are the same every step, and the echo is getting bigger and bigger. This is a deterrent, but also a challenge. The real enemy should be able to distinguish from the footsteps that Richard is good or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has noticed that something is not quite right in the front channel, but he only sees nothing and continues to move forward at a constant pace. Going, when Richard walked through the place, the passage suddenly burst into a stench, and a rat leaped silently from the shadows, rushing behind Richard, two rows of teeth that were enough to cut the metal.狠狠 cut to Richard's back neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it only plunged in half, and it was in the air. The minions danced a few times and hanged softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look back, but he stabbed the heart of the mouse devil with a backhand. He picked the mouse to the front and began to break down the recycled materials. However, before harvesting the material, Richard opened the mouse's chest and carefully observed the wound caused by the knife. Gradually, the light smile on his face disappeared and replaced with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Cha still remembers that the white night killing the mouse is like cutting vegetables. She usually only uses one knife. Richard now only uses one knife, but the white night goes down, the mouse The devil is basically a knife, but the one that Li has killed is still struggling for several times. It seems that the gap is not big, but Richard knows how far the distance is, and Richard’s knife is indeed The nucleus is stabbed, but the wound is not in the most important place, and the wound is slender outside, but the inside is sharply popped, turning into a group of fuzzy flesh and blood, which can really improve the lethality, but Richard clearly remembers, white night The wound left is very small, very thin, and the inside and the outside is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows wrinkled, thinking for a long time, only to raise the barbaric slaughter short knife, imagining a knife in the air, this knife seems to be unremarkable, However, he pulled out a few afterimages, and with a faint whistling, a knife smashed out, and Richard’s breathing was a bit heavy. He tried to mix it evenly, and then he stabbed a knife forward. This knife also whistled, but Richard still shook his head. The two knives, the blade has been shaking violently, but it is not aimless shaking, but every vibration is equivalent to a knife, even if Richard has four life-threatening bonuses, The two knives were shot and I felt quite unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the effect of these two knives is difficult to satisfy Richard, the blade is still shaking, and the vibration is not small, and the white night is not so much life. A knife down, plain, faint, almost unbelievable, but can not see the afterimage, she is extremely accurate, extremely fast, and extremely hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the moment of the white night, and slowly re-stabbed a knife. This knife is truly unremarkable, without any ability, Li Just want to let the blade advance to the expected location along the expected trajectory and expected speed, but when the knife is at the end, the real talent has already told Richard that the knife is still biased, although the deviation is almost negligible, even Drawing a third-order configuration will allow such deviations. However, when Richard drives life to a smash, and tens of knives are superimposed into one knife, a little deviation will be superimposed, eventually weakening the lethality to a very significant degree. In other words, if Richard can do dozens of knives, there will be no deviation, then the power of this knife will be incredible, and it will never be a level of a small wound on the illusory face. At the very least, I will cut off most of the imaginary face at least, and I will not be able to keep my arm at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is easy to do this. Richard now has a deviation from the simplest one, but in fact, the white night is far from the real perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is not in a hurry. He came to the field of extremism in order to sharpen his will, combat skills and improve his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard harvested the material from the mouse, and collected the most precious part of it, then cut the rat meat and put it on the waist with a wire. between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next period of time, he may be continually pursued, and perhaps he will not see a Dakso Das in a few days, if In the latter case, these pieces of rat meat will be the only source of food for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up the scene, Richard re-entered the journey, and after walking for a long time in the tunnel on the mountain side, Richard found another hole to the outside world. The hole was only a few hundred meters away from the ground, so Richard landed smoothly. He suddenly remembered something. Looking back, he saw the cliff standing on the top of the wall. There were many holes in the rock wall. Richard can't remember which hole he came out from in the front two times, and he didn't know where it will come from next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a general understanding of the direction, and has cast a small spell that everyone in the field can use even the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of magic condenses into a compass in front of Richard, the compass is colored, with ten hands on it, three of which are golden and seven are black Gray, different pointers represent different regiment fortresses, and the color of the pointer marks the camp of both sides. The golden color refers to Noland, and the dark gray is naturally Dakso Das. With such a spell, No strong person will lose his way in the twilight, and he will always be able to retrieve the enemy's fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a look at the direction and quickly found the position of the sun-drenched capital from the magic compass, just as he was preparing to go to the sun. When I was in the hair, I suddenly felt that the whole earth was slightly trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indescribable feeling suddenly rushed into Richard’s heart. This feeling is unclear. It seems to be a great crisis, but it is not very direct. Even Richard could not find its source. However, Richard instinctively produced deep awe, which was awe of the unknown existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
