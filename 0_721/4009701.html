			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Richard has been sleeping for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dreamless night, and the deepest sleep makes him slowly recover from the overdraft. Powerful magic and energy recovery agents condense this process several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old saying in the gray dwarf tribe: time is gold. But that refers to the time of ordinary people or secondary planes. For example, the time of people like Richard and even Su Hailun can no longer be measured by gold coins, especially their main plane time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he had taken the most important step, so he slept very quietly. It seems that the accumulation of Yu in the past few days has also been vented in the wolf-ridden conflict of the Iron Armor. However, he was still not fully aware of the extent to which his magical structure brought to others, even the entire dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s living area is larger than Richard’s and the floor is three stories high. In the eyes of outsiders, this not only indicates the love and attention of His Royal Highness, but also the symbol of the prominent status of the children of the great aristocratic family. Only Stevenson himself knows how much it costs to maintain this decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residential area of ​​Richard is completely free, and Stevenson needs to pay the full rent for a larger, more functional residential area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the case of Stevenson, who has the full support of the Soram family, the monthly rent of nearly 300,000 imperial gold coins is a very heavy burden. . And he still has to pay twice the tuition fee, although the Duke of Soram has paid his tuition in the next few years, but the cost of his coming to study in dark blue is not calculated this way, even if it is not professional. Amortized on a monthly basis, the interest that this huge sum should have generated is also a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources of this huge family of Soram can of course not only be invested in Stevenson alone. And the reason why he can impress the family council is that the family is eager to have a big builder with his own blood. This is the desire of any slightly ambitious family on the mainland. Randolph was originally the candidate, but his stupidity made him fail before he started. Stevenson seized the opportunity to persuade the family council. He is not only a dragon warlock, but also has the potential of a builder. His own resources are more than Randolph. In recent years, he has begun to participate in family affairs and has shown extraordinary performance. Talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, family investment needs to see a return. Especially after the Randolph incident, the family's patience has become more limited. The Duke of Soram has been promoted to the legend, and it will take a long time to expand the realm after two or three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Stevenson also bears the tuition of Minnie. Because after the marriage contract was established, Marquis of Nio could not wait to stop paying all the expenses of his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontline war is indeed tight, the financial situation of Marquis of Nio is on the verge of collapse, and because the war is mainly burning in the Marquis, the Marquis can support it until the end of next year. A big question mark. In the final analysis, it is because the Marquis’s men are too incompetent. Of course, in the mind of Stevenson, the uncle’s sequence also includes the uncle who led the Soram reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of Neo and Soram has an absolute advantage in the force, and is fighting on the familiar terrain, but has long lost the battle for Ellie. Don't say that it is about encircling or defeating her small army. Even if it is a positive defeat, it has never really happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman's sense of smell on the battlefield is extremely sharp, and the soldiers are erratic. Once they find the weak link of the opponent and launch an attack, they are stunned and sizzling. She used less than one-third of her opponent's strength to fight on a terrain that was not too complex and complicated, but dragged the team of Neo and Soram to exhaustion. Moreover, she ruined the fields, mines, forests and towns in Neo, all of which were looted, and those that could not be removed were destroyed on the spot. So every time she went to the place, she made the heart of the Marquis unable to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo's one-sided weakness also made the surrounding aristocrats rushing around, and Soram's strong intervention also paid a corresponding price. As the battlefield fell into a stalemate, Soram’s gains from the Marquis of Nio had been largely ruined, and then Alice’s troubles were quickly turned into losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest news from Stevenson is that the Soram family has decided that if the woman cannot be resolved within a week, then she will talk to her. As for the issue of war compensation, let Nio have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than half a year, Stevenson had already decorated his residential area quite tastefully. But now, from his bedroom area, the sound of various kinds of utensils is constantly being heard. One piece of exquisite and elegant art is smashed on the wall and the ground by Stevenson. The fragments are splashed around, and some are even passed. Stevenson’s face left a few faint bloodstains. The heavy burden of tangible or invisible pressure makes him almost breathless, and things can be vented a little, but only for a moment. But now he only asks for venting, otherwise he will be mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it is Archimonde! And Archimonde! They are all a group of madmen! Devil! The guy who is going to hell! Why are they coming? Blocking my way!!" Stevenson snarled and cursed insanely, but this was not enough to vent his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with the bedroom, only the old vase made of fine gold inlaid crystal is intact. This is the most cherished collection of an emperor in the ectopic plane. It is worthy of the art and time value that cannot be measured. The pure gold and the best magic amethyst are cut and sold, and there are more than one million gold coins. Stefanson himself couldn't afford this top art treasure. In fact, it is one of the private collections of the Duke of Soram, which is used here to support Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s wrath is also temperate, and thousands of pieces of ornaments are smashed. This thing is that Richard’s stepping on the public His face, he did not dare to touch it with a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini stood quietly in the corner, alone and beautiful. She is the age of the flower's first release, and the growing body and the arrogant temperament are more vivid and youthful. Only a few thin red lines on her face and arms, and the anger of Stevenson also reached her. The fragments of the splash are unrecognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Minnie, Stevenson suddenly angered again. At this moment in his eyes, Minnie is not a beautiful girl, a genius mage, but a huge gold coin black hole. Minnie’s tuition is only one-fifth of his tuition, but the absolute number is also quite large. Although her living area is not as big as Stevenson and Richard, it is not smaller than an ordinary magician, so the rent paid for her residential area even exceeds her tuition. Of these two, she did not include the cost of her practice of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Soram family, it is not difficult to support a Minnie. But when Stevenson's own expenses have reached an astonishing number, plus Minnie's part, it is particularly breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a ship that will sink, even if the weight of a small piece of stone is added, it will make people on the boat feel suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is very clear that after using the huge investment of the Duke of Soram, he has no room for failure. The life of the legendary characters will be greatly extended. In the long life of the Duke of Soram, there will be no shortage of sons and daughters, and there will be no shortage of talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s enlightenment teacher has long told him that genius is nothing before becoming a true powerhouse. The genius born every year on the mainland does not know how many, only those geniuses who have enough resources to support can grow. Those who do not have access to resources can only have a seemingly brilliant empty title, and before adulthood. Because when they grow up, it is really nothing, even worse than ordinary people, the aura of the past will be the shadow of their future life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randolph is a recent example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is extremely eager for success, fearing failure to the same extent, because the road he has come through has been turned into an abyss of hell, even if only a small back The steps are all broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Dragon Warlock is not worthy of such a huge amount of funding. The reputation of the social circle is not worth so much gold coins. As for the management of family affairs, as a continuation The ancient family of more than EMI has countless managers. In fact, in order to get this opportunity to become the constructor of Su Hailun, in addition to the family and the personal resources of the Duke of Soram, he also invested a lot of human and material resources from the matriarchal. Once the family decides to give up, then his fate will not be much better than the mage who are busy and earning money outside the dark blue inner ring zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the wooden bridge leading to the framer, Richard’s figure has just grown, but like the “God of Heaven” Augusto Mountain Range Yokohama was in front of Stevenson, and he did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his self-proclaimed marriage contract with Minnie made the Duke of Soram pay a larger sum of bills. In fact, this can't be blamed on Stevenson. He just acted according to the rules of the aristocratic society. In the circumstances, he made a decision that was most beneficial to his future development. Because the father and the wife are extremely important in addition to the paternal family. Resources. But who can think of the shameless and unrequited love of the Marquis of Neo, directly to the best daughter to the Soram family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Stefanson is almost snarling on Minnie’s face: "You! You said, what do you want now? Except every month for you." In addition to paying a large tuition fee, what else can you help me with! Is it helping me to improve my skills in construction, or help me get the teacher's favor?! You said! Now that Richard is far away Far away, let me know what to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Minnie’s silence, Stevenson is more difficult to suppress his emotions, he sneered "I almost forgot that you are still a woman, at least for going to bed. Now, you strip me off and roll to bed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini did not argue, Without rebellion, he silently took off all the clothes, lay in bed, and separated his legs. When she did all this, her expression was calm. But after lying down, he put his face to the side, not letting people see the tears that could not stop flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini closed her eyes and did not wait for the violent collision in anticipation. After a while, still no movement, she could not help but open her eyes and saw that Stevenson was standing by the bed, holding a bottle of spirits bottleneck, and sipping a mouthful from time to time. His eyes crossed Minnie's body and stared at the ice floe bay outside the window. The harbor in the night is not completely dark. The ubiquitous ice reflects the wonderful gleam, without any signs of biological activity, and it is particularly chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
