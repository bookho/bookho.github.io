When he walked out of the family cemetery, Richard's heart passed over the list of all the enemies, so he decided that since he had awakened his real name, it was time to recover some interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out of the study and told the servant to pick up a new tight-fitting dress and then take a photo in front of the mirror. This dress was cut by the master's hand, almost no extra decoration, and the two pants, like a sword, lined out Richard's perfect body. Richard took an ivory comb from the servant's hand and carefully combed his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard hangs the long knife extinct at his waist and orders: "Let Faschi wait for me at the transfer array."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Faschi and Richard met, and when she saw Richard, she immediately felt that what seemed to happen to Richard, but she could not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" asked Faschi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the Bear Peter family to see." Richard's answer surprised Faschi. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard walked out of the fascinating shrine of Faust, the Neris and Agamemnon who received the news were waiting there. Behind them, there are a group of aristocratic young men and women who have made good friends with them. This group of people did not know for what reason they were called up. When they saw Richard, they immediately felt that something was about to happen, and they were all excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are young after all, and when they are young, they are afraid that the world will not be chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris saw the investigation and immediately came up and asked: "Lee! Is there anything good to find us so urgently?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Is it a good thing to go to the bear island family on the floating island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nyris eyes brightened, and immediately rubbed his head: "Looking for it? Great! I have long seen that they are not pleasing to the eye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nyris felt that something was wrong, so he quickly glanced at Agamemnon and saw Agamemnon nod his head, which gave him a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha put everything in his eyes, but only did not see anything, but smiled a little, to the transfer hall of the floating island 7-7 go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two Bear Peter family warriors standing at the entrance of the temple, which is quite chest-high and full of momentum. In this transmission hall, the Xiepide family has the lowest status, so the Shapirate family warriors will rely on the momentum and fierceness to make up for the lack of status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two warriors saw that this group of people came to this side, but they immediately stupid. Every bear Peter recognizes Richard and knows Gotton. Of course, they don't want to put Richard in the past, but the problem is that the group of people behind Richard also know most of the faces. They are all fascinating. The characters are young people. Of course they know that these second generations are sometimes not offended by their father's elders. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men looked at each other with a bitter face and took a hard step on the scalp, stopping Richard’s way and saying, “Stand up! The front is the Schumpeter family. Territory, without permission, cannot move on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard faintly said: "I just want to find the Duke of Peter Peter, let me go! I don't want to kill you guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, two 膘The fat and strong Xiong Peter Warrior was swept away by Li’s gaze. He was so cold that he could not help but retreat two steps and let the road leading to the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first to step into the transmission array, Nyris, Agamemnon and dozens of aristocratic young men and women who watched the excitement also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 7-7 floating island transmission flashed on the array, and dozens of figures appeared at one time, scaring the warriors who guarded the transmission array. They only saw the clothes and clothing of the coming people, and they did not dare to block them at random. They were pushed to the sides by the aristocratic youths. The youth flocked to the floating island square and then looked at Richard, looking forward to what would happen next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha faintly smiles, walks to the center of the square, looks around, and looks away from the faces of more than a dozen bear-Peters around the square, then Said: "I am Richard, Richard Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain tone of the word, under the influence of magical power, becomes vast The extreme sounds echoed over the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund...Acmemond...Arcmond...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The echo is long-lasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Bear Peter, who is tasting red wine in the small living room, trembled, the wine splattered from the cup, and left in front of his white shirt. A large piece of stains. The duke pushed away the panicked maid and refused to clean the stains on the clothes and rushed out of the living room to the castle's terrace to see what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a secret theater, a girl with black straight hair, like a pink doll, is waving a long whip, and the whip is constantly slamming A steel scorpion dummy five meters away, and a line of poems on his chest. The long whip is as flexible as her finger, but when the echo comes, her hand is also shaking, and the whiplash leaves a deep nick on the dummy's chest, which will complete more than half of the sonnet. damage. She immediately dropped the long whip and ran to the echo. Unlike the horror of the Duke of Peter Peter, her little face turned out to be a strange excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the floating island, several expensive old people are either in Otaru, or are using afternoon tea, or are enjoying antique vases, and one Let the beautiful maid pinch the back. No matter what they are doing, when the huge echo came, they were the first to start, and rushed to the position where they could see the outside, and wanted to see what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one, Peter and Peter were all alarmed by Richard’s greetings, and they put down their hands and flocked to Floating Island Plaza. In the sight of Richard, the number of bears and Peters is increasing rapidly. Twenty, forty, sixty... In the twinkling of an eye, even the windows of the adjacent building are crowded with people on the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very patient, and when he got enough, he floated a chilling smile and said, "All of you should be I recognize it, and I am very impressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence contains indescribable hegemony, self-confidence and arrogance, which makes Shapirs change color, but makes The aristocratic youth behind Richard are bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third sentence of Richard completely boasted the bears: "You, you should have been cleaned up from the floating island!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the same young and energetic Bear Peters screamed wildly, and wanted to tear Richard away. But without the orders of the elders, they did not dare to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xionpide is now in a subtle position, and he can continue to stay on the floating island without knowing how long it will last. Although the last time I retired the battle of the city outside the city, there are more emerging families in the eye. At the juncture of life and death, all Schumpeters know that they are acting in a low-key manner and cannot easily provoke trouble. God knows if what they are doing will not provoke the door to be unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is just a 14th-level magician. Surprisingly, all the elders of the Schumpeter family have collectively lost their voices. At this time, an old voice came from the top of the castle: "His Court of Nyres, Lord Agamemnon, are you also coming to us with our bears?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That is the Duke of Old Bear Peter, who appeared on the terrace, and a scarlet red wine stain on his shirt was very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris loudly said: "No! We are just visiting. If you want to do something, even if you do, leave me alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee ignored the dialogue between Nyris and the Duke of Peter Peter, pulled out the long knife from the back, reversed the blade, and put it on the floating island with a bang At the center of the square, then continue to say: "You should all recognize this knife. Yes, it is the treasure of the family of the Bear Peter family. The legendary knife is extinct! This knife was originally in the hands of Sinclair, I killed her, this The knife belongs to me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears and Peters are in vain, staring at Richard’s eyes and wishing to spurt the fire! The more angry they are, the more laughter Richard is. He caressed the extinct handle, as if he touched the face of Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Richard raised his left hand and pointed to all the bears, and said, "If you want to get this knife back, you will go to the green." I am here to find me! I heard that you still have a sanctuary, but I want to see if there are a few men in the battlefield on the battlefield!!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thunderous buzz and the most red/naked/naked challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a crisp and sweet voice rang out: "The Bear Peter woman can also defeat you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw a strange and beautiful girl, black hair, red sputum, white skin, such as the eyebrows and Sinclair are similar, but the temperament is very different . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha unknowingly threw a detective on her, then squinted at her figure, faintly said: "I advise you to change your personality, like You are like this, how many are sent in white."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrel is furious, his eyebrows are upside down, suddenly like a ghostly ghost, like a ghost I don’t know when I have a light knife in my hand, and I plugged it into Richard’s chest! Sosrel is already at the 16th level. This raid is fast and embarrassing. Although it is not directed at the heart of Richard, the chest is also seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is furious, if this is a duel, it is absolutely unfair for the comrades to take the first shot than the legal person. His hand was placed on the sabre, but he was held down by Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
