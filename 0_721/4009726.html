			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the hall, everyone finally has no need to restrain their hearts as if they are small The cat's claw-like curiosity has been discussed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock instantly spurts out like a real flame, which is clearly a sign of deep sanctuary. In the face of a 19th-level, and perhaps even 20th-level wild warrior, no one in the scene dared to say that there is a battle to win. As for the Stevenson side, the two soldiers specially sent by the Duke of Soram did not dare to look at the steel rock. They really had to throw them into the battlefield. They were not enough to make a few punches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of people’s discussion is not steel rock, but the identity of a girl. Su Hailun’s self-funded qualifications for auctioning thousands of gold coins in the Millennium Dynasty is no longer news. The top aristocrats on the mainland know that the ultimate winner of this qualification is the granddaughter of the 1000-year-old Garan Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Dynasty can be traced back to the era of the Elven Empire. There are many elves in the blood of the Emperor. Therefore, the Dynasty is also famous for its art, magic and superb martial arts. But no one expected that the granddaughter of the Garland Emperor would appear here, and it is clearly a barbarian girl, and the guards around him are mostly barbarians. This contrast is too strong. However, as soon as the identity of the girl was revealed, some people immediately discovered that the few human warriors in her team were the most elite court guards of the millennial dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing the identity of the girl, people’s eyes changed immediately. No matter whether it is dissatisfaction or mourning, the powers and demeanors all describe dignity and arrogance with just the right pride. It is a big aristocratic leader who often enters and exits the court. The royal family of the Millennium dynasty, the blood of the emperor, the grandson of the Garan emperor, this identity has been steadily regulated and poured all the people present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson’s mouth moved again, and there was a desire to say that he was also a self-funded impulse, but fortunately, there was no stupidity to tell it. Self-funded is a magical word, placed on a girl's momentum, it is a joke on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel rock is obviously still unfinished, and I want to say something more. Looking around and patrolling, the hands made a few gripping movements. Seeing his meaning is to find someone to fight, activities and muscles. However, the girl suddenly raised her hand and the steel rock immediately closed her mouth. For a moment, the entire hall was quiet because of the girl's movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl closes her eyes and looks up, her small, straight nose twitching, seemingly sniffing something in the air. The old man behind the girl who was sleepy at the moment also opened his eyes completely, glanced at the hall, and then resumed his dying appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took a shot of the arm of the steel rock and said, "Taste! Did you smell it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Steel rock also sucks hard, and picks up the sound of the wind, but when you look at the face, you know that he didn't smell anything. The girl closed her eyes again and began to follow the invisible smell of the air. More than a dozen barbarian warriors followed suit behind the girl, and there was no sound in the hands. The movements of the barbarian warriors all have the rhythm of tribal dance, but when several human warriors mixed in with them raise their legs and walk slowly, the whole team is very funny because of the strong contrast between height and body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But none of the people in the hall laughed and ridiculed a few 18-level court guards was never a wise thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl, like a detached person, walks through a group of nobles, throwing countless curiosity, expectation and lost eyes behind her. And the people in front of her have given way, slower movements, or not knowing the current affairs, just like the Stevens just finished. The girl always slams or shoots all obstacles that are consciously or unconsciously in front of her without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young girl's small body contains amazing power, almost a humanoid ancient bimon! When she slaps and slaps two 12-level fighters together with their lords to a few tens of meters away, no one is willing to stop in front of her, to try to see if she is smelling something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most inconspicuous corner of the hall, Richard is standing in front of a giant lizard, holding a pen and paper in his hand, constantly calculating what is being calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price of 120,000 gold coins of the giant lizard is quite good, can be used as a carrier of the initial order. However, it is obviously a bit large and the total price is too high. It is important to know that in a complete magical structure, the carrier matrix accounts for less than 10% of the total cost. If the substrate is to be 120,000, then Richard, who is not prepared to take even a gold coin from Gordon, cannot afford it. So he is calculating how to make the most of this skin, for example, using the rest of the material to make other magic items for sale in order to recover a portion of the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the giant lizard is irregular. The person who was originally collected is obviously not professional enough. Although the integrity of the leather is maintained, the edge of the split is concave and convex. There are also a few strange parts in the way of picking the skin is very strange, making the overall shape more and more weird. And the part that Richard intends to use to make the magic pattern is completely uniform, so the cutting distribution is also a very high problem, both to ensure that the construction body takes up the best part, and that it must not be too fragmented. Scraps are used to make magic items. Richard has been concentrating on calculating the plan to maximize the use of magical paper, which has been filled with dense numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the giant lizard is not enough in this exhibition hall, and it is not known how it was mixed into the legendary mage inventory. The gray dwarf once wanted to get rid of it, but based on the principle that the mosquito legs are also meat, it is still put in. Perhaps the dark blue auction can slightly increase its value! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the text description of the auction item, there is no such detailed product. In addition to its size and texture, there is only two words in the source column, which is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf’s suspicion is that this unlucky guy just ran into the magic range when he was hunting under the Highness, or it was not the prey of the legendary Master himself, but From what place to use for packaging, but the traceability of the source is not worth it, so the gray dwarf used a wave of "unknown" meaning endless words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Richard, whose hands are extremely limited in gold coins and materials, it is as good as snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once immersed in the digital world, Richard almost forgot the surroundings. Anyway, this is the corner of the lobby exhibition area near the warehouse, and no one is interested in such an ordinary thing, so he can always complete his calculations quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not know that he suddenly became the focus of attention in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched by thousands of gaze at the same time, in fact, it is similar to being stared at by the dragon. Richard suddenly burst into a cold sweat, awakened from the lengthy formula, instinctively looked up and looked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his vision, a girl with a strange costume is leaning her head, closing her eyes, using her nose to sniff in the air, and hurried to him. Come along. Behind the girl, there are more than a dozen singular barbarians, and a few warriors with magnificent armor. In his opinion, it seems to be a gesture of stealing and keeping behind the girl. However, Richard's true talent keenly warned him that the ridiculous strength behind the ridiculous movements, because even those samurai who were full of metal, did not make any noise in the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
