			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the soldiers in the camp have already eaten enough, and hurry up in the stream I took a shower in the lower stream and then went into the tent and went to sleep. They have become accustomed to taking advantage of all the rest, as long as they are not assigned to the whistle and vigil, they are falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Richard’s camp, someone had put a plate of barbecue for him, and a bowl of broth that was still hot. The delicious taste was known as the ogre's handwriting, so Richard took a quick meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is completely relaxed physically and psychologically, but he feels mentally awkward and does not hurry to sleep. So I took out the structure from the town bear knight and began to repair it. A small number of components will eventually be unusable, and most will continue to be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After overnight, Richard had five primary forces and one primary defense, and the growth rate ranged from 15% to 25%, compared to the original. The effect of the structure has been greatly reduced. However, compared with the take-away type that Richard is preparing to sell on this plane, they are artifacts. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard only left a 15% increase in the power of the assembly, and the other components were made into plug-ins, loaded into the pace of the knights Body. There are only five left-handed knights, and the only one-level knight of the 11th level has gained strength and defense, while the youngest one has nothing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now under the blessing of the construction, the combat power of these battle knights has generally improved, and it is completely stable at the level of the eleventh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team with strength again strengthened, walked for five days in the forest, and finally found the forward base of Sinclair under the guidance of quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a huge base like a small town. The towering time lighthouse is very eye-catching. The gate of the cave is engraved with the sign of the Mensa family. However, just like the forward base of Archimonde, this city-scale base is quiet, through the city gate, you can see that there is no one on the empty street, like a ghost field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base is located in the middle of the dense forest, located in an abrupt open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not directly enter the base, he thought of his situation when he first arrived at the Faro plane, so he stationed the troops in the distance and personally adapted In the direct battle of the mountain forest, they brought five heads and began to search for the area around the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This search is really effective. One kilometer from the base, Richard found a small military camp, where there are about 100 soldiers, including five. The Knights of the Temple and a young pastor. From the signs of the Knights of the Temple and the priests of the priests, they are the servants of the stable god Xerxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody land, Richard spent a lot of time learning the knowledge and teachings of this plane god. In a sense, they are the deadly enemies of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the other side, traces of the portal and battlefield remains were discovered. Although the battlefield has been cleaned up and cleaned, it is still possible to imagine the fierce battle of the day from some indelible traces. But all the bodies have disappeared, and it must have been moved by the people of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly returned to the camp until the night was quiet, only led the team to cover the camp where the temple troops were stationed by the cover of the night, and then waited until midnight. Point, most people in the camp were caught in a deep sleep before they launched a raid and captured the camp in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing the arduous battle of blood-staining land, this raid was easily shocking. The ordinary soldiers just climbed out of the bed and saw the sword that was handed to the front. The first reaction was to surrender. The Knights of the Temple are as high-spirited as ever, even if the bare butt gets up from the bed, they must also fight their fists and fight with the enemy. Although their fighting will be impeccable, but in the face of armed to the teeth, fierce and brutal enemies, the battle is not able to reverse the willpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Richard entered the camp where the young pastor lived alone, the other person had just sat up from the bed, sleepy, and had not figured out what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raid was a great victory, and even one of the people on the Richards did not even suffer minor injuries, while the opponents killed ten people and all the others surrendered, including The young pastor. Five of the Temple Knights died in battle, and the other two were stunned before they stopped fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this result, Richard shook his head helplessly. His men's men and women have been violently savage after a series of bloody battles, and they are extremely heavy and often unable to hold their hands. Therefore, in the battle, the opponents in the battle are far more dead than the injured. Richard asked the soldiers to clean up the battlefield and count the spoils. They sat in the barracks where the young pastor lived, and then asked the priest to come in and start the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who did not fight, of course, did not have any strong will, nor the idea of ​​devotion to Xerxes. He cooperated very quickly and quickly answered all the questions of Richard. As a cleric, his practice will definitely affect his beliefs, and even lower his grades in serious cases. But compared with life, the level reduction is not so serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastor's name is Kas, the true age is consistent with his young appearance, only 22 years old, and the pastor level is five. Within the system of the gods of the Faro plane, a powerful god such as Xerxes, the fifth level can be called a pastor, and is a level that can be responsible for a single transaction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Kas, on the day of the invasion of the invaders, a powerful god, Xerxes and the middle of the gods, the temple of the gods suffered a fiasco, fighting the priest The regiment and the Knights of the Temple were completely annihilated. This is almost all the strength that the four great temples can extract, so the two churches are so badly hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the temple of Xerxes joined the army of the local lords of the Iron Triangle Empire to launch a second expedition, but found a powerful alien invader I have not known where to go, only to find a base that does not know where to come from. At that time, the powerful team composed of the fighting priests, magicians, knights and senior officers of the local lords entered the base to investigate, but suddenly there was an accident. From time to time, some people suddenly lacked a certain part of the limbs, and some people suddenly became old and even died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, at the cost of nearly 30 lives, the team finally withdrew from the base. At this time, they discovered that in this seemingly calm forward base, there is a turbulent time and space force. Any ordinary corner may be filled with death traps. It is not manpower to fight. Even a strong sanctuary died in the aging effect caused by the accelerated passage of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God official announced that the base had lost its role and was banned due to the influence of time and space. He finally sent only one team of soldiers to stand next to the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The care of the forward base in the inaccessible mountains is undoubtedly a bitter, and few are exiled. Therefore, the young and handsome pastor Kas apparently had a bad relationship to a certain degree before he was assigned such a job. The reason why he set the camp a kilometer away was actually that the time and space power of the forward base was overflowing and spread to the camp. Regardless of time or space power, even if there is only one trace, as long as it hits Kas, the five-level priest will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
