			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three servants of the Akmon family were beaten in an instant. Their 5th and 6th level of combat power is a qualified adventurer on the mainland, but in the face of the combat power of the Joseph family servants 8 to 10, they have no ability to delay time. And Wolin was as mad as he was, and the nobles and the servants of Joseph’s family did not dare to take too much, so they made Wolin support for a while, but he had already smashed a lot of fists. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more dangerous the feeling of danger in Richard’s heart, the more sudden the conflict suddenly occurred. He just wanted to retreat. A servant had already rushed over and flew up to A strong side kick kicked to Richard's waist! This foot is fierce, clearly has used a bit of vindictiveness, can completely kick a poor magician rib! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, a flash of anger flashed into the air. He took a step back quietly, just let the servant's flying kick fall, then hugged his servant's boots with his hands, and suddenly he made a force, and the servant's ankle was completely deformed. However, at this moment, the sound of the roaring wind rang again on the side of Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small forest not far from here, Senma is sitting on a branch lazily, leaning on the trunk and drowsy. However, her faint eyes suddenly opened, and her face with a fascinating face immediately suffocated her murderousness. She snorted, carrying a fine-sword, jumping from the tree, and going in the direction of the fight. But only one step, all the actions of Senma suddenly stopped, as the time in this space has solidified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, behind the trunk, I don’t know when a thin, thin man appeared, wrapped in a dark gray hooded cloak, his hair is hay The color, a few clusters of cluttered from the edge of the hood. Although his face could not be seen clearly in the shadow of the hat, but the sinister eyes were particularly bright, and a large piece was raised in front of the cloak. I don’t know what weapon to use to point to the back of Senma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma did not move, slowly turned his head and said in a cold voice: "Viper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man made a burst of laughter and said: "Dear Senma, this is the third time we have met. They are old acquaintances, I will not talk nonsense, you better dismiss immediately to save people. The thought, as long as you are worried, it will be seriously injured by me immediately, save the adult not to say, maybe you have to leave your life here. So, now, your wise approach is to slowly turn around. Slow, slow One point, you can't reveal a little flaw. Otherwise, this broken armored arrow worth thousands of gold coins will open a hole in your lovely little waist. Do you want to try your beautiful and practical armor? Its power? Actually, I really want to shoot your ass, but I have to wait for this arrow to succeed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma really did not take another step forward It did start to turn at a slow and constant speed, but she was not angered by the venom of the serpent, cold Said: "Viper, your ability I know very well, waiting for me to turn over, you want to run is not so easy. Do not think that I do not dare to kill in the vagrants!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The venomous snake smiled and licked his lips, making a sigh of noise, saying: "In fact, we don't have to make it so intense, isn't it? Today, Master Fogg finally caught the opportunity, and must teach you. Wolin, who doesn't know how to be good. In fact, Wolin has no place in the Akmons. Why are you so serious? And you hurt me the most, but I can't kill me. I believe I can go to the temple, I don't. Believe that you dare to kill in the face of the temple guard. If you must do it, then even if I am dead, there is a blood saint to accompany the funeral, it is a big profit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Senma's face is getting colder and colder, and the cold said: "Wolin is no longer useful. It is also a member of Archimonde! It is not until you insult him. I will give you the last chance and will not disappear within three seconds. In the future, there will be no poisonous snakes in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Threats? Or bragging? I will help you count down!" The snake did not put the threat of Senma. In my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is deadlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the street has a moment to end, not surprisingly, the Joseph family's force is completely overwhelming advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four servants of the Archimonde family all fell to the ground and could not climb at all, and even those who wanted to report were intercepted. The aristocratic youths still surrounded them, kicking their feet from time to time, and screaming at the people. On the other hand, although Wolin was also knocked down to the ground and was held down by a servant, they did not dare to go through the same few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the nobles, when fighting, the combination of fists and feet is a battle, and it is an insult to use one after losing the force. Moreover, these aristocratic youths are members of the family in the lower part of the floating world, and the best is only the vassal of the Joseph family. Therefore, in the face of their class, Wolin and Fogg's status is quite equal. If they dare to go beyond the rules, Wolin may have no way to take Fokker after this incident, but it is more than enough to pack them, and the family will never shelter them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the old proverb is to see who its owner is before playing a dog, but a smart dog has to learn not to bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also fell to the ground, the difference is that two servants pressed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Richard, the other two servants of Joseph’s family fell to the ground, one holding the unnatural twisted right foot and the other holding the knee. It hurts pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them was the first one to fly to Richard, and the result was suddenly broken by Richard. The other was a knee-high collision, but was smashed by Richard with a piece of raw ore that he carried with him. After using the ability of the outbreak, Richard took advantage of his strength, and the skills of the dark world made him accurately hit the other side. But after all, he was a magician, not a senior warrior, so he couldn't flash the attack from behind. He was hit by the third servant, fell to the ground, and was held dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very stunned, and the intense pain made him black. If you don't get a good physique in the dark blue, only the servant's full punch will make Richard faint. And such a heavy blow in the vital parts is likely to have a potential impact on Richard's future magical career, resulting in injuries that only high-ranking priests can recover. In addition to the head, Richard's arms and body continue to have severe pain, and the shoulders are so painful that they seem to break from the body. His face was crushed on the cold rocky road, and only the right eye could see a narrow line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme shock and humiliation has filled the brain of Richard, all the blood is on the top of his head, he almost boiled! It was only two servants who pressed him in this completely insulting position, and they were so bold that they left no room at all. Every time I was pressed for a second, Richard felt as if he had been slap in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened so quickly, from the beginning of the conflict, to the Akmon family, everyone was knocked down, less than two minutes. Richard also lost his calmness for a moment, suddenly screamed like a beast, and tried his best to earn it, and the upper body actually lifted up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
