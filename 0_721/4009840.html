			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the night will fade, the mountain lakes are far away, the sand and Richard looked up almost at the same time and looked at the night sky in the northwest. Under the night, you can see a fireball that smashes the sky and falls to the earth. The meteor is extremely splendid, and it seems that the light of the endless galaxy is faint, and it is very eye-catching, and the trail is endless and long-lasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Liusha also felt a faint time and space turmoil in that direction. This feeling is very familiar, and when they come across the plane, it is like being in a river of figurative time, very similar to the present. With the falling of the meteor, the clear and cloudless night sky actually sounded thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the sky and felt a lot of sly and huge will from the thunder, it was their angry roar that led to nature. Wei, making the night thunder, let the mortal have a feeling of sorrow that the sky will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the wrath of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and Richard looked at each other, and then the sand said: "It seems that there are intruders coming to this plane. Just don't know what it is." People.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the whereabouts of distant meteors, Richard’s precise talent automatically calculates the drop and distance, while searching for regional maps in his mind. He heard a faint smile in the corner of his mouth: "Good thing! We can have at least more time now, and the eyes of the gods in this plane will not be all on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not necessarily the case, head, we still have to be careful!" Elf Oral said with some anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Don't worry. No matter what kind of team you come from from the ectopic plane, it is better to go to the lower level than ours." The team is much stronger, so the gods should worry about them more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are only high grades." The water is cold and blunt. In the death camp, the prey that she killed was almost two or three higher than herself, and she was four or five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's just a high level, isn't that better?" Richard laughed and said, "It won't take long, except for Noland. In addition, we can get a set of precious coordinates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is reminded at the side: "Generally only the main plane can open to the secondary position. The passage of the face. So what we get is probably the coordinate of the other main plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this set of coordinates more precious? Richard replied faintly. However, the deep meaning of his words, the people behind him are gradually boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the camp, the new hostages have been linked to the home of Mr. Gao. The number of troops descended was nearly 50, and several of them were sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the camp was very subtle. The only two stepping knights apparently did not fall asleep. Sitting on the side of the campfire, the weapons were in the most ruthless position. The two fast beasts were not patrolled in the woods, and they were quietly not far away. The camps of the soldiers were not lit, and they were silent. But as soon as Richard came back, the camp was opened up in small and small gaps, and apparently they did not fall asleep. However, it was quiet and tight at the top of the camp. It seemed that the atmosphere that would break at any time was completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the arrested three dying jazz family members, I heard that Richard attacked the port city, the Knights of the Temple of God, and burned the record of the Temple of Courage. Three of the captains finally decided to surrender. . In this way, at least Richard will not rob their territory for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard divided the descendants into three teams, each led by three stepping knights, each with a sealed knight, plus a few crossings. The killing of the soldiers as a backbone, supplemented by other descendants, constitutes a team. Such a grouping can guarantee the control of the troops, and at the same time, it can maximize the combat power of the stepping knight. This group of step-by-step knights is not only a small soldier who will be rushed to battle, and their experience in the command of the battle is equally rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days at the lakeside, it was estimated that when the Earl’s reinforcements were approaching the Baron’s territory, Richard made an unexpected decision to release all the hostages. He arranged for the two Knights who said that they would not surrender and escorted the ladies and the young masters back. As for the transportation, they were the two carriages. They were not enough. They could only walk on their own without sitting on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the hostages, Richard set off the camp and the team was divided into two. The three stepping knights led the troops and brought some horses. Heading west, trying to cross the mountains and find a secret road leading to the Duke of the Wolf. Richard took the rest of the people back to the forward base. There are still a lot of supplies to be replenished. In fact, the most precious of the entire forward base is the time lighthouse, but unfortunately it can not take away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s plan is to take a few more days in the base and crack Essien’s diary. Anyway, it should be safe at this stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon of the day, the road leading to the baron of the Baron of Fossa was soaring, a team of knights with bright armor and horses marched lightly. Bright silver armor and scarlet cloak make them look very powerful. Behind the knights, there are three times the number of cavalry. They are the servants of the service of the knights, and when they fight independently, they become brave light cavalry. After that, it was the infantry of the brigade. Most of these infantrymen wore armor or half-body armor, armed with various aggressive weapons, or huge tower shields. At the end of the team, there were hundreds of archers, and the longbow with the height of the person behind him was obviously an elite longbow shooter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army is small, only about 500 people, but well-equipped, personnel are powerful, only the momentum is far more than the Baron's army. More than a dozen red and gold flags flying in the wind are the symbols of the Earl of Galleon. These arrogant battle flags have been on the battlefield and have left countless enemies stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the guards informed the Baron Fossa, the baron boarded the watchtower of the castle, and looked at the end of the road with an alchemy telescope, so they saw the flying Battle flag. Baron Fossa’s gaze rested on the flag of the black-bottomed blood-stained axe, which remained for a long time, and the lips were tightly tied together, and the corners of the mouth continued to fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belles Baron! How could it be him?" Fossa muttered to himself. He suddenly felt that his head began to hurt again. The recent troubles were already enough, and Pelican’s accident came and added a big sum. And this trouble still doesn't know when to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Pelisa Gold is wearing the iconic deep black heavy armor, and the horse is walking in the center of the team. He is very tall and thin, with a yellowish face, and the carefully trimmed shorts do not add elegance, but instead make him a bit more sultry. His eyes are always half-closed and half-closed, as if he had just lost sleep last night, only sitting in a straight posture, even without unnecessary shaking, can only slightly see the grace of his strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
