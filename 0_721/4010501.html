			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ruin on the altar, followed by an old woman walking on a cane When she reached the center of the image, she glanced at it and laughed like a nightingale. She said, "Who I thought it was, it was a Vatican priest. You didn't preside over the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Alliance. Suddenly I remembered that I came, but unfortunately, now you are no longer a person who can walk freely. Even if you want to teach me, you can only think about it, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s face looked a bit ugly, snoring softly, without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old woman is named Jojan, the grand priest of the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Tree Dynasty, who presided over the priest in the eternal dragon hall of Noland, Jojan They are all mavericks. The great priests like young and beautiful are instinct. Time is condensed on them. Therefore, all the great priests are beautiful and beautiful, and they are the most dazzling moments in their lives, but they are the most dazzling moments in their lives. Jojan did not use this privilege, but allowed time to pass, and she became older and older. Of course she could not die. Before a new generation of priests took office, she would live forever. If no new priests appeared, Then she will live to the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy’s temper is as bad as her character, almost offending all the great priests, and she is particularly hated by Vatican because Vatican is a oracle In this generation of the great priests is unique, and before the official residence in the eternal dragon hall, Vatican is also the god of the gods, the glory of the mainland, glory, at a certain moment, Vatican suddenly disappeared, its Later, she appeared in the eternal dragon temple of the Holy Alliance, and officially took over the eternal dragon temple from the hands of the last great priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Liu Sha said: "Jorry, I want to ask you one thing. What activities did the Holy Tree Dynasty have on the mainland of Calando, especially It is related to the holy temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorry looked at the sand and sneered: "It’s another god, two successive gods appear in In the same Dragon Hall, it seems that the Holy Alliance is to be named in the annals of history, but even if there is anything in the Holy Tree Dynasty, why should I tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Flowing sand brows slightly wrinkled, cold road: "Jean, now every minute of the call will consume a lot of my grace, so I am not coming to listen to your cynicism, what are the conditions, although you open, but you only have One chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have encountered a major event, but why did you find me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline said: "No matter what, where happened, We can still know that this matter is related to the sacred dynasty, and they can't come to the eternal dragon temple to sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Zhen smiled again Get up: "The priest of the Eternal Dragon Hall can't easily interfere with the secular affairs. It's a heavy price. I don't know what kind of little white face can make the two gods so hearty. You won't share one, hehe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smack of anger on the face of the sand. Suddenly, the body was quite tall. Just in front of Vatican and Jojan, she suddenly grew taller and looks better. From the girl who has not grown up, she has become a beautiful and glamorous person. Now she is less than twenty, and she is the most prosperous. However, in addition to her stunning face, there is still majesty that cannot be overlooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe, take away your set." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Zhen’s face flashed a trace of panic, and there was also a bitter cheating, sneer and said: "Why should I listen to you, let your little white face die?" It’s not better in Calando, it will make me feel good, and you don’t want to talk to me like this. Otherwise, I will say hello, even arrange some people to deal with your little sweetheart, you think Let a dozen ugly slaves behave in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand suddenly closed his eyes, silent, one minute, two minutes... It’s ten minutes passed, every minute, it’s a huge amount of god’s consumption. The dazzling book of time is now dim, even Vatican’s face has changed slightly. At the other end, Jojan still looks tough. However, there is obviously uneasiness in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full fifteen minutes passed, and the sands opened his eyes and said faintly: "I understand, no matter what I do, I will eventually meet." Come to you, Jojan, you are just a stepping stone that forces me to take that step. When I choose the road, you are useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don’t know why, the story of quicksand suddenly made Jozhen panic, it was a cold from the heart, she cried hysterically: "Sand sand, although you are a god, but I also host a dragon temple The great priest, don't think that you are so great, I am not afraid of you, never."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha still said in a faint tone: "In front of God, all glory and status are illusory. The dragon of eternal and time has chosen you. You are the great priest. If you abandon you, you will not be anything. To be straightforward, it is an idiot, chosen by God, and can be a great priest. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you are so Arrogant." Jozhen was so angry that she could not speak, and the chill of her heart was getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jorry, do you want to be mad with me?" Liu sand suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorge was obviously shocked and said: "You are so young, how much grace you can have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowing the sand and smiling, said: "I am going to open up an eternal dragon temple in the dark area, you say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Zhen screams : "Dark territory, you are crazy,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sober." The sound of the sand is as calm as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Zhen’s face was extremely ugly, and he looked awkward in the eyes of the sand. He said, “The little...the young man, it’s right for you. Is it important.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsale refers to your own heart and smiles and says, “It’s all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, I admire you." The old woman sighed and said: "The Holy Tree Dynasty sent their six emperors and nine emperors, accompanied by the Chinese Archbishop, to Calando to participate in the Holy Scriptures, and Prepare to use the Heavenly Armed Forces 'Ulele' to exchange Midaren lost in Calando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this have to do with the Holy Scriptures of Calando. Asked the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the blood of the royal family of the Holy Tree can drive the armed forces of the heavens. The Six Emperors are the continuators of the original Ulle, and this time they sent him to The son of Calando gave birth to a child, so that the child would have the blood of the beast and the sacred royal family. On him, the saint totem and the kingdom of heaven can be perfectly combined, which will be Karan. Add a super strong, and his power will be unlimited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the sacred dynasty silly? What is the benefit to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorry said: "I just know about it, it is said to be seven. In the arms of the kingdom of heaven, Midarun, who lost in Calando, is also known as the king of angels. Once its power is fully awakened, it will far exceed the remaining six sets of heavenly arms, and repairing Midarun also requires the blood of the Son of God. Only in this way, after the repair of Midrand, it can be used for the sacred dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and the Vatican are silent, after a while, the sand is said: "I I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That needs me to do anything." Jojan asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try to remove their grace and tell the Holy Tree Dynasty not to accept the sacrifices of their people during this time. Let their radiant gods find a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it." After that, the sand drifted off the communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eternal dragon temple of the sacred tree dynasty, Jozhen looked at the ruins of the ruins that had lost their glory. For a long time, the cold sweat of the body had soaked the robes. How crazy and arrogant she is, she dared not to confront a gods who were determined to open up the dark field. Moreover, the decision of quicksand quietly touched a scar that had hidden in her heart for nearly a hundred years, and let her see a trace of her own. shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eternal dragon hall of the floating world, the sand and the Vatican are still standing still, silent, and finally the sand broke the silence, saying: "I saw it. Well, I really have no choice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s face is unbeatable and ugly, saying: “The barbarian guys actually did this kind of thing, they Isn't it always advertised its purity and tradition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is actually very calm: "There are no wise men in the barbarians, they must have seen the situation long ago. Change, the balance of power between Calando and Noland is losing balance. Before the crisis of survival, all principles and exercises are something that is dispensable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
