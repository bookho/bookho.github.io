			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When crossing the street, the sand suddenly stopped and then quickly opened In the hands of the book of time, a divine power spurted out of the pages of the book, turned into a magical 'treatment', and fell on Gangde, a dozen meters away. So Mintel’s roar and Gangde’s laughter sounded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked up. Oral appeared on the roof of the corner and pointed in one direction. So Richard immediately ran with the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody sealed knight appeared in the alley. He saw the back of Richard and the quicksand, so he smiled and strode down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the roof of the lane, the water splashed quietly, and then jumped silently behind the knight, like a ghost without life. Her **'s double is enough to move in a fine and extremely fast pace. It has been posted behind the knight, and the 'eternal sleeper' waved across the sky, so the knight's head flew high, but the headless body was still moving. Running ahead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sealed knight crashed down, the figure of the water flower had long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha seems to fly aimlessly in the base, but it can often appear in the most dangerous places in the battlefield, and the sand-splitting magic makes serious injuries. The pace of the knights recovered to the peak of the battle in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong and clear sense between the soul-connected splash and the nest and Richard, and Richard can know exactly where they are. The magic slavery contract also relies on the power of the soul, although the induction is very vague, but they also perceive their position in close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, it seems that the battle in the base is very chaotic, but the only chaos is the side of Sir Mintel. He himself was entangled in Gangde and could not issue effective instructions. Another Jazz Huber died at the beginning of the most powerful time of the sand. The rest should have been to search and encircle the warriors. They are all fighting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard can sneak control of the battle, he and the water and sand to form an erratic team, wandering around the battlefield, to fight in the crisis The Cavaliers supported the massacre of ordinary warriors with magic, and even used themselves as bait to lure the captains to chase and kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war was so slightly tilted and slowly eroded the ranks of Sir Mintel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest is one of the most worried about Richard, not only because of its weakness, but also because of the unclear feeling. In the hen's nest, Richard is really unable to predict what will happen. He can only convince himself with the reason that the eternal and the dragon of the time gives the believer at least not to his followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard saw the mother's nest, it quietly squatted beside the warrior who was knocked down, and also moved two wings to express himself. As soon as Richard’s eyes left, it immediately ate his head. The sand that appeared later was clearly seen in this scene, but nothing was said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very screaming voice that rang in the corner of the base and quickly weakened until it disappeared. Almost everyone had a chill, and Mint’s men, both warriors and marquis, were subconsciously unwilling to get close to the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the mother’s nest climbed out of the low house, and on the corner of the street not far away, there was no head of another sealed knight. The body, which immediately flew forward, grabbed the body with a blade and dragged it into a house next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it climbed out of the house again, the whole body was a big circle, and the abdomen bulged closer to a sphere. At this time, the short wing fins struggled to beat, and they could only hold the mother nest for a short time, and the height was less than one meter. At this time, a soldier just touched out from the corner, and suddenly saw a black pressed object almost drifting past his nose, scared out, almost immediately cut out. However, the compound eyes of the mother's nest have been eyeing the warrior. A spirit has been attacked in the past. The soldier has not even had time to lift it up. He has shed several blood lines from his nose and ears, and he immediately fell down. The nest fell to the ground, and some hard climbed over and dragged the soldiers into the house next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the location of the mother's nest, and the mother's nest knows his position. Whenever the mother nests eat, it is always a long way to leave Richard intently or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dropping a soldier again, Richard finally stopped breathing a few mouthfuls. Even with the dual support of the structure and the sand-sanding technique, his physical strength and magical power are close to dry. The battle has now reached the limit. The sand-flowing magic can heal the wound quickly, but it can't restore the strength without damage. The base has already not heard the screaming of Mintai, only his heavy gasping like a cow. Gangde has no extra strength to comment on the giant axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness, Richard issued orders to two points with vague feelings. That is the ogre brother, saying that it is an order, in fact, they can only vaguely feel the vibration in consciousness, but this is enough. This is the signal that causes them to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more than a dozen soldiers guarding the pastor and the seriously wounded outside the base. They suddenly felt that the ground under their feet began to tremble slightly, and the branches and leaves of the trees shook and shrouded. Sarah sounds. They looked around and suddenly saw two huge stones flying in the woods! The boulder smashed in the middle of the soldiers with a bad wind, bouncing and falling again. An unlucky guy was directly smashed into a patties, and three other soldiers were stabbed. Suddenly, everyone has not even responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, a fireball is flying out. This is the most pure fireball, with standard power, standard cast time and normal mana cost. Tiramisu proved himself to be an authentic magician. After the fire, the soldiers have fallen halfway. The young priest ran very fast this time. He was only thrown away by the edge of the fire, and suffered a slight injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremor on the ground is getting stronger and stronger, and the three-pointed and huge figure is coming out, and it is unmatched to attack the chaotic soldiers! He is no longer naked, but is covered with a thick layer of steel armor, with a helmet like a barbed steel ball on his head, boots with animal skin as the bottom, and the same thick nails. Steel sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-pronged steel armor does not have any enchantment, and the thick and solid steel plate can make the enemy desperate. This set of hundreds of kilograms of heavy armor can make them difficult to move, but it does not affect the three-pointed action. This is actually a more powerful ogre than the same kind of can still hold a hand hammer of the same hundred kilograms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Noland, the adult ogre is a monster that makes ordinary adventurers shun. In the secondary plane, they are unreasonably upgraded to terrible monsters, and only elite teams can try to challenge. And more terrible than the adult ogre, no doubt is the ogre wearing heavy armor and holding a heavy blunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-in-one is like a moving steel fortress, murderously rushing toward surviving warriors. Perhaps the fear of the soldiers is not deep enough. The three-pointed body constantly illuminates two magical lights. The second magic is to give him a layer of taupe from head to toe. The seriously injured Knights had already picked up their weapon shields and wanted to resist them. These two magics made them scream in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
