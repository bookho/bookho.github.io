It is also a place that Gordon will inevitably come to before the big battle. Before going to the Qiqi plane, Gordon once sat quietly here for a whole day, every time he sat. Here, Richard will involuntarily think about what the man will think when he sits here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice room is very empty, originally facing the outside of the floor-to-ceiling windows, it is like seeing the world, and after the last renovation, Richard made people The windows and the frame were all removed, so sitting on the edge, there was a lonely wall, and the feeling of hanging on the cliff seemed to be sitting in the arms of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a whole month, Richard was always meditating, but the environment was not quiet, because there was always a lion-like snoring in the ears, which did not disturb him, but made his mood more peaceful. His life is once again like a pendulum. He will be active once every seven days and receive reports from various ancillary planes. During this time, the planes are calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already calculated the fourth track, so these days are always trying to capture the fourth star, he found that the meditation effect of the lower plane is still not as good. Noland, and the rest of Noland's meditation is not as good as that of the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Faust, Richard always perceives many special forms of stars, while others are much less. For Richard, light is At this point, the advantages of fait is not comparable to other places, nor is it that other levels of power are lower than those of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, Richard will also ponder why Navito is so special, but can’t find the answer. Faust was not built by humans, as if human history began. Before this, the city of miracles had already existed. Until today, there are still many mysteries waiting for people to discover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month of meditation, Richard did not know how many times he failed, pushing the star into the calculated orbit, and it is very difficult to stabilize smoothly. There are too many variables, and the wisdom talents of Richards feel that they can't control. I don't know how many times, always the last distance, the stars are out of orbit and far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous failure for a month, Richard not only does not worry, but more and more quiet, the more difficult, Richard understands, it means the greater the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the twinkling of an eye, it is the thirty-first day of Richard’s meditation. This evening, I don’t know why Richard always feels restless, and many past events are involuntary. The ground was floating on the heart, most of which was the childhood of Rutherland Village. At this time, Richard was awakened. It has been so many years, but the former residence in the raging fire is still in sight, and it is just as true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so many years, Richard still failed to fulfill Ilanni’s wish, even though he is now the patriarch of Archimonde, the power is in the grip, the overall military has Formally surpassed the Gordon era, but Richard felt that there was a last obstacle between himself and the crater of Archimonde, that is, Gordon, until now, Richard still thought that he did not reach the height of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, Richard would retrieve Gordon’s body from the deepest part of the world, bury it on the top of the family cemetery, and set up Elani’s tombstone. In the heart of Richard, this is really completed. Mother's wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the past, Richard suddenly moved his mind and looked up. The unobstructed view was full of flowing blue, and I didn’t know when it happened. There was a huge blue star, but the smell of it made Richard very familiar. It was very similar to the monthly force of the fourth string of the blue moon. For a moment, Li was mistaken to think that it was not the power. The star, but the blue moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a state of meditation. Richard does not seem to think about whether it is real or illusory. The familiarity of the stars makes him feel like these days. Now, I tried to start pulling this blue star, but I didn't think it would succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t expect that the blue star would start moving toward Richard’s blood. This blue star is extremely huge, and it’s the track. Filled up, almost no amount left, but this time the capture was unexpectedly smooth, and the heart was stopped from the beginning to the end. All the unexpected changes were resolved, and the blue star was finally put into orbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blue star itself began to run on the track, Richard suddenly realized that it was not the star force, but the pure blue moon In the secret sword of the elves, Gordon only had the magic of the fourth string of the blue moon to be destroyed, because it was the sword that Ilani used to pierce the heart of Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart pain, so clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore this sword is also the strongest sword of Richard. In the power of the seven-stringed string, Richard uses the most monthly force of the blue moon. Skillful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of flying around the orbit, the star of the blue moon is released from the orbit, releasing a thick monthly force that flies to the core of Richard’s blood. The monthly strength of the stock has not been integrated into the monthly life tree. Anyway, thinking of the dark red sinking down, it is integrated with the blood of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard’s whole body was shocked. He only felt an indescribable coldness, loneliness and desolateness flowing through his heart. For a moment, he was so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard’s heart is neutral, it raises consciousness, and this is not another kind of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the real name of Dissmason emerged from the lava. After the destruction, the original darkness of the sky lit up a long real name, still destroying, more powerful and more complete destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are infinite in every divine symbol that allows Richard to recollect infinite things. Every new divine is like a statue in front of Richard. There is an infinite number of mysteries in the new world. In these worlds, the rules of the same kind or different types are put together, some are like light belts, some are foggy, seemingly chaotic, actually close It fits like a myriad of small parts of a precision machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every god represents a rule, a force, an element, on another level, they are the basic unit of the rules, and Those rules may once again form a new god. If it is a reciprocating, the whole world is like a spiral type of ladder. There is no end to the top and the bottom. If you explore it, you will use the known gods to spell out new ones. The rule, down, is to analyze the internal rules of the gods. No matter the up and down, you can master more new gods, and to some extent, it means breaking away from the bondage of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha, just happened to appear on a section of the spiral ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually understands that whether it is up or down, it is the same general rule, leading to the road of breaking through the world, even if it is just a small step, strength It will bring about earth-shaking changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change that destroys the real name is not over yet, a long string of divine symbols are gathering in one place, then swaying like water waves, beginning to merge with each other, in fusion In the process, the star body composed of the blue moon was released again, and once again sank into the blood of Archimonde, and then several gods in the real name suddenly became brighter. The original smooth process was very smooth. Some waves started and began to regroup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every god is a world, and the big world contains countless small worlds. When the gods fuse, the rules inside will be released. Then they are reunited under the traction of some mysterious power to build a new world together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that these gods are meant to reconstitute a new meaning of the gods, and Richard immediately understands that this is an unparalleled opportunity, even more than a tree of life. Through the process, you can see how the rules and the gods are structured and transformed. Therefore, Richard mobilized all the wisdom and real talents and began to record the whole process of evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
