			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is now in the forest not far from the base, the whole body The carapace slammed and began to grow again. The bulging abdomen has shrunk significantly, and it is clear that the stored food has been consumed. This growth makes it more than three meters in length, and the height of the back is almost the same as that of an adult man, but there is no significant change in the foot and the blade, as well as the head. It took a few steps forward and left three translucent eggs in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The egg is oval, and it stretches rapidly as soon as it falls. Through the egg wall, the creature inside is rapidly growing. Then the two blades slammed through the egg wall, three and a half meters long, and the worker bees, which had a similar shape to the nascent nest, climbed out of the egg chamber. The three worker bees took only about ten minutes from spawning to birth. After they broke their eggs, the first thing was to eat the egg shells cleanly, and then shake the body. After the shell hardened, the body shape became bigger and bigger, and it was nearly one meter long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three worker bees flew up and flew around the mother's nest and quickly flew deep into the forest. The mother's nest is quiet and in place, and the night is like a dark rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has come, and it is still sunny tonight, the starry sky is shining, although the moonlight is light, there is still a gauze-like brilliance scattered into the forest. The mother's nest suddenly moved, changed direction, and indented into the shadow of the trees. He heard the vague voice coming from afar and immediately alerted him. But then it smelled the familiar taste, so the open carapace slowly gathered again and regained quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred meters away, an open space in the woods was illuminated by the torches as bright as white. Ten captives have dug up a large pit and a small pit. At this moment, the body of a warrior is being removed from the cart and thrown into the pit. The two stepping knights were fully armed and monitored the prisoners. The bodies of the two jazz and the sealed knight were placed in a small pit, showing a different treatment. This is in line with this position and also fits the tradition of Noland. There is always a distinction between nobility and civilians, and even more so after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body was quickly buried, and the sand drifting concession knights took the captives back first, indicating that they still need to pray here. After the day's battle, Liusha has established an authority in this team that is second only to Richard. Almost everyone owes her half life. As long as there is flowing sand behind them, every soldier will feel very at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands stand quietly in the same place, and the knights and captives disappeared into the field of vision. She opened the book of time and turned to one of them. The book page depicts a beautiful illustration of the eternal and time-honored priests roaming around the continent, spreading doctrines, searching for and treating a story called a 'whitening weak' magical disease, but strange There is a small spot on the illustration. Looking at the position of the light spot, I will close the book of Time and walk deep into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snarl of the bear is faint in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worker bee flies to the front of the mother's nest, throws down the rabbit, and then returns to the depths of the woods. There was a creaking sound in the bushes, and another worker bee pulled a gray wolf and climbed out. The gray wolf is bigger than it is, so the worker bee can only drag it back to the nest to step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a roar of roaring screams from afar, a fat black bear suddenly rushed out of the woods. Not far from it, a worker bee flies in a hurry, always at the height of the black bear's claws, and it is very flexible, and it is always flashing through the black bears when it is not allowed. There was an obvious wound on the top of the black bear. It seemed that he was bitten by the worker bee. Seeing the black bear that was thrown, the mother nest that was quiet and quiet also stood up excitedly and climbed against the black bear. When the distance was close to ten meters, the mother’s nest was shocked and the black bear suddenly stood up. Then, in pain, I can't keep rolling on the ground, and I won't move after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flowing sand came out of the trees, it was seen that most of the black bears were eaten. The mother's nest stopped eating, and the sand was watched with vigilance. The mouthparts opened slightly and began to have thick acid droplets. Obviously, if the sand shows hostility or is too close, then the one that greets her will be an arrow-like acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands stopped and said, "You don't have to worry about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest First, I vibrated a few mouthparts. The back of the head suddenly opened a small piece, revealing a little film. As the film vibrates, it starts to talk like a human, but the sound looks a bit hoarse and weird: "Because you There is no soul contract with the owner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand smiled faintly and said: "The relationship between me and your master is more stable than the contract."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only believe in the contract." The mother's nest replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you have a spiritual link? So we can communicate through the spirit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest categorically refuses: "You have a strong power in your body. Before I enter the mature body, I will never be spiritually linked with you! In addition, my suggestion It is the book in your hand that puts it down. It makes me feel very uneasy. I can't help but want to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand raised the time The book, said: "Is this? No problem." Her movements let the mother's nest suddenly open the carapace, but when she saw that she really squatted and put the book of time on the ground, the mother The nest was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we can talk about it. My name is quicksand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call My mother's nest. Beautiful sand, what are you looking for?" asked the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted and asked with great interest: "Is it really beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The mother's nest replied with a unique honesty: "Yes, very beautiful. In my eyes, everything that is powerful, balanced, perfect is beautiful. You meet all the above criteria, especially on your forehead. The lines of the road contain unimaginable power, which makes me shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will really compliment." If the lazy sand is not beautiful, the holy mystery is like the ruins in the eternal dragon temple, as if the clear amber solidifies every vicissitudes of time, then the flowing sand that laughs, the time flowing, the countless planes and the space Magnificent and thrilling at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sand quickly picked up the smile, and said, "Your master, Richard, is not in a good position. He really needs your strength." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to grow, and you are bothering me to eat." The mother's nest replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is only a small black bear, and asks: "Can this food satisfy you? How far are you from maturity?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black bear is very good, it has power. In addition, now I can be regarded as having finished three-quarters of the young body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very powerful..." Flowing sand sharply captured the word and then asked: "What food do you need in the early stages of life, besides flesh and metal, need powerful creatures?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
