In front of Richard is a kilometer-high mountain, and the range of hundreds of meters from the ground up is like being cut by the giant with a sharp axe, and there are pieces of cutting surface that are patchwork. Each cutting surface has a ten-meter square, which is covered with various windows, entrances and vents, and is covered with boulder on the surface, decorated with carvings. In the upper part of the foothills, a dwarf avatar with a height of tens of meters is embossed. It is said that this is the great figure of the pioneering furnace kingdom, a statue of Doro the anvil that is close to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, the entire mountain is like a huge peak nest. From time to time, you can see dwarves coming in and out of each hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Richard is quite emotional. Dwarves, like worker bees or ants, are naturally interested in excavation, construction and forging. Although they are not particularly numerous, they have been digging for hundreds of years, but they have also created a miraculous sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the power of perseverance and time is combined, there will be miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two inconspicuous investigations, Richard and his entourage entered the furnace. Entering the gate of the Furnace Fort, there was a grand hall nearly 100 meters high. Standing in the hall of 500 meters, Richard immediately felt that he was extremely small. At the end of the hall is an iron gate up to ten meters high. The iron gate is tightly closed at this moment, and only four channels on both sides can enter and exit. These passages are the same as the passages that Richard has seen, and they are wide enough to make humans feel very embarrassed. Fighting in this type of terrain will play at most half of the combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw the opposite vertical wall covered with large and small windows. Near the top of the hall, there is a natural huge opening. If there is an invasion by foreign enemies, after entering the hall, as long as the dwarfs close the iron gate opposite, the intruder will immediately face the saturation blow from the top, bottom, left and right. If the dwarves are throwing out the warhammers in tens of meters of height, it is the human heavy shield warrior that can't resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard frowned slightly, and he did not expect that the dwarf would actually build this hard-to-reach castle. At least with the troops he brought, I don’t even want to take down the furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Faro plane, it is known that the dwarf is a very determined ancestor worship race. And there are many precedents for becoming gods among the ancestors of the dwarves. The Furnace Kingdom, a race that lasted for hundreds of years, is almost full of ancestral gods, and has the potential to become a demigod or a Holy Spirit. This is not the same as the statue of the beast god that was captured in the cracked stone camp. Richard estimates that the value of this thing may be comparable to the head of a big devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Richard has to temporarily put out the mind of the furnace. Moreover, if there is no grasp of the furnace, and even the grasp of the dwarf is not enough, then most of the transaction negotiations are not too much cheap. Fortunately, Richard has long been prepared to fully adjust his mindset and use the second plan as the bottom line. The main content of the second program is the normal trade between the two races. The first plan, natural and plundering is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the furnace, the fire must be out of the show, with a group of people walking around the melting pot deep in the castle. It can be seen that the magma continuously emerges from the ground cracks of several hundred meters deep, and is lifted to the ground through a special passage. It is divided into several lanes. After flowing under the feet of several dwarf statues, the violent violent firepower immediately becomes much more stable. The flow has also become smoother and faster. These fires flow most from under the melting furnace and continuously release the firepower to the furnace to melt the metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard saw the statues of the apparently special dwarfs, he moved his heart and asked the beards around him: "The statues of the dwarves are very special. I smelled the power and the metal on the top."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire must be very proud, saying: "They are the statues of some of the most outstanding smelting masters in the anvil's descendants, and there are the souls of those masters. They use the power of the spirits. Controlling the power of the magma, the source of the disaster becomes the source of the melting pot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"British?!" Richard was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! Several masters have the power of the Sanctuary before their death. Before they died, they voluntarily sealed their souls out of their love for ore and metal." The statue became the spirit of the kingdom of the furnace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked sideways at the sand, and saw the same enthusiasm and regret in her eyes. It is not very comfortable to see the precious sacrifices in front of you, but the feeling of being unable to take them away. These statues that sealed the spirits were enough for a low-level sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to ask the fire: "So how do these melts come from the cracks of a few hundred meters deep?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire must be a fanatic: "That is the power of the great Doro. The anvil! If it wasn't for him that constrained the power of the melt, there would be no today. Furnace Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked a few more questions, except that he knew that in the depths of the underground melt is the temple of Doro, he would never ask again. Something else is out. The fire must not go to the true temple of Too many. The high temperature there is that ordinary dwarves can't resist. Only the dwarves of the sanctuary can bring special protective equipment to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a tour in the Furnace Fort, Richard finally saw the Dwarf King, Barmoor, Steel Hammer, Doro. Anvil in the King's Hall. Twenty-two generations of grandchildren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King's Hall is equally magnificent, with a dome of up to 20 meters giving people a sense of awe. At the end of the king's hall, there is a high ladder. Barmoor. The steel hammer is sitting on the throne at the top of the ladder, overlooking the Licha and his entourage below. On the wall behind him is a mural of rock carvings depicting the scene when Doro's anvil was built into a melting pot. On both sides of the king's high platform, each has an arc-shaped platform, and four high-back iron chairs are placed on each side. The eight dwarves sitting on the high back iron chair are the eight elders of the furnace kingdom. After the introduction of the beard, Richard knew that half of the Presbyterians had the blood of the anvil, and the other half were the dwarves who excelled in other fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight benches of the elders are engraved with totems, which symbolize the eight fields of exploration, excavation, mining, smelting, forging, brewing, sacrificing and fighting. . From the field of the division of eight elders, we can see that dwarves pay more attention to ore and metallurgy. The brewing will actually set up an elder, but it is a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard’s rituals of Jinjian’s affair, the high dwarf king Baalmo said: “Human, your manners are very thoughtful, we saw you against the dwarves. Respect. Otherwise, you can't get here. In front of the Furnace Fortress, your 10,000 warriors are nothing at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agree: "Really, Furnace Fort is a fortress that will not be compromised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bammore proudly said in a thunderous voice: "Building from Furnace Fortress Since that day, it has never been framed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
