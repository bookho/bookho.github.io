			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the meditation room while finishing the equipment while continuing to release consciousness All kinds of orders, so the entire blood-stained land began to boil, a team of different sizes of soldiers of different arms began to advance toward the scheduled battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Camp is the goal of the Iron Triangle Imperial Frontier Corps, and Richard is ready to place the battlefield here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of the decisive battle, one party is the 30,000 elite of the Imperial Frontier Corps, and the other is the five thousand defenders placed in the camp and placed in the camp. Eight thousand troops outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky 10 kilometers away from the battlefield, the brain is floating, and the pictures of all the elite bats are returned together, and they are continuously sent to Li. Inspect, every minute, the brain will update the situation on the battlefield, which relieved Richard of the burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war, Richard did not have the same line as the battlefield outside the city, but stood on the head of the Blue Camp, which is even more The position of the command, the soldiers according to the arms division, every 100 people will be equipped with a hen nest elite knight or warrior, so in the consciousness of Richard, the entire force is broken down into about 140 basic combat units, while fine-tuning over hundreds of goals Command, or the first time since Richard Wisdom talent was promoted to the fourth order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army of the Imperial Frontier Defense Corps led the army into the battlefield, the eyelids suddenly jumped involuntarily, and he saw the Blue Camp. I saw the Richard on the head of the city, and I saw the eight thousand troops that Richard placed outside the camp. It made him feel the glare of the army of 8,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Richard’s strength is very clear. He does not intend to conceal in this respect, and the strength of the leader of the Imperial Army is double that of his opponent. If he still does not dare to fight. Then, he can be said to be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the eight thousand people who were placed outside the city were too neat, neatly arranged to the point where each knight’s lineup was almost the same, and one by one. The soldiers stood like a statue, and they didn't even see any subconscious little movements. Only some of the knights in the center of the military array looked a bit random, but they all had almost tangible murderousness, which means passing through the hundred. The strongest of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in his life, the head of the army lost confidence in the victory in the case of a dominant advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is still beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 8,000-armed regiment that was placed outside the city began to move forward, relying on the defense facilities of the Blue Camp, and directly slammed into the front line of the border guards, in Richard’s Under the command, it is like a huge grinding disc, carefully and patiently grinding the front of the emperor's regiment, and crushing the torn warriors, a whole 8,000 people, just like a whole, the army leader has never I have seen such an army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge grinding disc is spinning endlessly, the arms of the various units are seamless, and the border guards surrounding the grinding disc are constantly losing blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle took place all morning, and by noon, the border guards finally collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-eyed corps of the army gave a shocking arrogance, and flew from the army and went straight to Richard on the city. He knew There is no death, but the war situation has entered a desperate situation. Looking at the relaxed and calm of the city, he can't swallow this breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and stopped Zong Hu, who was ready to start, and said faintly: "You let it go, let him come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fierce army leader fell in front of Richard, watching Richard’s entourage retreat, leaving him a vacant lot, could not help but bow, holding a big knife, I don't know if it is going forward or backward. He has long seen that the commander of the other party is a magician. How dare he let him close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and hooked him, this is a gesture that everyone can understand, the head of the army’s steel-like beard roots upside down With anger and madness, he took a heavy step like a giant elephant and strode to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when a glare of knives was lit up, the head of the army understood why Richard dared to wait alone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood smog is still fading, but when it is still condensed, the squad's body that lost its vitality falls from the city, sinking heavily in the mud, blood has Dyeing the red robes, I don’t know how many wounds he had opened in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun moved slightly and the sun came from behind Richard, so the soldiers who were killed by the city looked up and saw only a silhouette of Richard's sickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early season of Faro, the main force of the Fifth Army of the Iron Triangle Imperial Frontiers was completely destroyed by the blood-stained land. He died in battle with seven holy areas, and Richard’s loss was unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war shook the entire Iron Triangle Empire and shocked all the restless people in the Sequoia Kingdom. It was the Fifth Army, the Imperial Team. The elites in the sequence also have their place in the battle of glory in the Eastern Expedition. It is by no means comparable to the aristocratic private army of Saranwell and the army of several defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the next day, the empire called for the semi-idle state of Salenwell to return to the emperor to discuss how to deal with Richard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guards sent the expedited message from the emperor with super-remote magic to the hand of Salenwell, he was sitting on a stream in the mountains. fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this season, the stream has just frozen, there is no fish, but without fishing, Saranwell has nothing to do, the trained recruits will be levied by other legions. Going, training and doing, and he is now not getting the military subsidy of the empire, relying only on the income of his own territory, even the most tens of thousands of troops are struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the magic message, Saranwell silently said nothing, after a long time, the letter was smashed into a ball, and he threw it into the stream, watching it flow downstream. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard was shocked, and Ai Ai said: "This...His Royal Highness, this is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What's wrong, now I want to drive Richard out of the bloody land, it's too late." Salenwell said faintly, fishing in the hands of the fishing rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Saranville fishing is the general of his last legion, this stout man would rather endure the treatment of more than half, and chose to stay By the side of Salenwell, there were five generals in the same family. He felt that loyalty was enough to entrust the descendants of the sons. As a result, when he really lost his power, there was only one person left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This general frowned: "His Royal Highness, there is no way to deal with Richard's kid, not killing him, I still can't swallow this breath. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell said with a smile: "What else do we kill him? He now has a group of sacred sects and a strong country, and there is a knight who is so elite that he can't think about the agenda, and we have more than one fight with him. He has the ability to use his troops. Under the same strength, who can beat him. The intelligence he just sent said that the troops that Richard can use are close to 30,000, and he only used less than 15,000 troops. It was all over the 30,000 main force of the Fifth Army. It is already late, unless the Empire is willing to attack, otherwise, no one can do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh." The general slammed on the rock with an angry fist and broke it into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, we may have the last chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What opportunity." General I am overjoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a big battle on the day, Richard pro-four thousand iron ride He marched straight and slammed into the nest of the border guards at lightning speed, and defeated the tens of thousands of defenders who stayed at the base in the night attack. Only a few hundred people escaped. Richard did not fight and took prisoners. Returned to the blood-stained land, and eventually extorted millions of ransoms from the Iron Triangle Empire with over 10,000 prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, Richard expects that there will be no more war on the human kingdom, so he waved the followers to the west of the blood-stained land. And the north, to explore the access to the ancestral highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a land of barbarians, which is not a barbarian warrior, but a harsh environment and barren land that hinders humanity from exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is always curious about the blood of the barbarian. From the soldiers he has left, the barbarian is absolutely elite, stronger than the dwarf, but from the mother. In terms of the analysis of the nest, the barbarians have little room for potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves often have fighters of the ranks of the strongest players in the town, but the barbarians can reach the 14th grade, but most of them are barbarian warriors. There are ten levels in nature. They don’t need special exercise at all. Once they reach adulthood, they can reach this level. According to what Richard has learned and seen, this is totally unreasonable. A race with an average of ten can appear. The possibility of a strong 18-level power is great, and when the population base is large enough, there may even be a strong 20-level power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
