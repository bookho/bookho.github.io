			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has observed these flesh-and-blood warriors in his images, and their combined combat power is around ten. This is a not too high number, but it is clear that the flesh-and-blood warrior is a mass capable of mass production, and the short-term production is even faster than the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the flesh-and-blood warrior is placed in the human army, even if it is according to the Norland standard, it is quite as good as the step-riding knight. Such a unit is obviously only a cannon-ash consumable in the reaper. Judging from this point alone, the reaper may be two levels higher than Noord, or even a three-level civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant Mex screamed, she did not expect the team reapers to come all toward themselves, and the reaper's speed is too fast. In shock, she hasn't reacted yet. Dozens of large and small fighters have already completed their aiming, and the light in the muzzle begins to flash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex was white as paper, and now what kind of defense is already late, the shadow of death is instantly in my heart. She is very aware of the power of the beams condensed in the muzzle, knowing that she can't stop it by armor and body. But now there are dozens of reapers' fighter planes, and there are four small fighters inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devastating beam of light is shining, and Meks’s vision is full of light, with a breath of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She desperately closed her eyes and waited for her death, but suddenly she heard the drink of Richard: "The cross sword defense!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex instinctively half-squatted, slashing the epee in front of him, arms around the head to protect the head. After doing this, through the gap between the arms, Mecks seems to know when there are more three-mirror shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror shields that are condensed by magic are extremely high in reflectivity, and the reaper's high-energy beam is incident on the mirror surface, and is instantly reflected and scattered by a small half. . Although the three-mirror shield was continuously blasted, the power of the beam that was directly shot on Mex was reduced to less than one-tenth of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex’s combat experience is also quite rich. After the first panic, the calm has been restored, and immediately, a low drink, vindictive, and the last high-energy beam It was down, and then one moved to a few tens of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go to heaven, fight on the ground. Go to those flesh-and-blood warriors, keep moving, don't let them have a chance to lock you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li pointed to Meek Then, his figure seems to move, and several images appear in the Reaper's fleet. I didn't see how Richard shot, and the reapers' fighters exploded immediately, but the wreckage was pulled by the invisible force field and sucked into one place, turning into a metal scrap ball of several meters in diameter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scrap ball is not safe, and many of the mechanical components are still changing, trying to unite with each other and reassembling into new war machines. But how could Richard give them this opportunity, and the blue fire immediately flew to the metal scrap ball and immediately burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the scrap ball is shrinking, and a large amount of black ash is smashed out, leaving only a finger-sized silver metal. But it is the blue fire that can't be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received the silver metal in the bottle, and then the figure flashed and disappeared in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Mex was in a hard fight. She cursed loudly, as if she could only vent her depression in her heart. She never understood, obviously that Richard is much stronger than herself, and did not use any special hidden means. How can the reaper find himself not to find him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a hundred flesh-and-blood warriors have surrounded Mex, and the inner flesh-and-blood warriors keep rushing to her, slamming with a double knife. The outer flesh-and-blood warriors shoot with high-energy beams when they find the gap. The legendary gold armor of Meeks has been damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper's attack is too intensive, she can't dodge the shooting lock of all flesh-and-blood warriors, can only keep moving at high speed, and constantly counterattack, killing flesh-and-blood warriors . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the target of the Flesh Warrior is small, but the metal skeleton is extremely hard, Mex is going to break their bones, and break the armor of the knight. The difficulty is almost the same. This also caused her vindictiveness to be quickly consumed, and soon her face was flushed with abnormal blushing. But the flesh-and-blood warriors who died under her sword were only twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex is very clear, if only on his own, then the remaining more than 90 flesh-and-blood warriors can definitely kill her, and there is a transport plane, she I can't escape even if I can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Mex’s heart was filled with bitterness. She knew that she was overconfident and too naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously just a squad of the Reaper, and it is part of the squad's relatively limited flesh and blood warrior. Just this part, you can kill yourself here. It is no wonder that there are so many wealthy people in the history of Noland. When they meet the reaper, they can only sigh unlucky, let the reapers drag the plane away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the transport plane, Mex suddenly raised an idea. If the transport plane is killed, can he not escape? Although the assault transporter has certain risks, it is better than being killed by a flesh-and-blood warrior. Now that there is some defensive power in the gold armor, she has the last chance to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex’s idea must have looked at the transporter hovering in the low air, suddenly leaping into the air and rushing to the transport plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she moved, she saw a bright red sword light as she walked through the middle of the transport plane. The transport plane was not opened, but was instantly shattered and split into hundreds of large and small fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Richard flashed again, appeared in front of another transport plane, and swung the sword with a plain and plain sweep, and the plane was cut flat. And then it was shattered into pieces with dozens of mechanical beetles carried on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also released the traction field and absorbed all the pieces into a metal ball. This time, Richard did not release the blue fire, but waved it and put it into the space bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he turned to Mex and said, "The idea is good, it is worth encouraging!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Richard reached out and pointed to Meeks and shouted in the language: "Bright wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of squares The mirror of light appeared around Mex, blocking all the high-energy beams from the flesh-and-blood warriors. The figure of Li is flashing again and has appeared among the flesh-and-blood warriors. As soon as he appeared, these flesh-and-blood warriors suddenly involuntarily floated in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of Richard King of Metals. The metal formula of the Reaper is extremely special. He is still in the process of analysis, deformation, fragility and rust. The ability can't work, but simple traction can still be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this ability, Richard directly floated these flesh-and-blood warriors in the air, and constantly manipulated their directions, so that the high-energy beams they shot were all lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex was stunned. Being able to manipulate nearly one hundred targets at the same time, and only Richard, who has the wisdom of talent, can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh-and-blood warriors quickly gathered together under the traction of Richard, and then Richard sang in a hoarse chaotic language: "Withered."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark yellow ball of light suddenly appeared in the sky. Under the light ball, the flesh and blood part of the flesh-and-blood warrior suddenly oozes blood and oily yellow liquid, and is then sucked into the light ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the liquid components of the flesh-and-blood warriors are all sucked out and merged into the deep yellow ball of light. The flesh-and-blood warriors immediately turned into metal racks with dried meat, which fell to the ground and lost their ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex looked at the deep yellow light ball in the air, his face was full of fear, and he shouted: "Flesh and blood is withered! This is the exclusive ability of the devil. You...you actually have this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the flesh and blood withered, but it is not the devil's exclusive ability." Richard faintly Say. He blamed the holy sword on his back and said to Meks: "Miss, you have enough feelings today, and the reapers you killed are not as much as you blow. Then can you help me?" , clean up the battlefield?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is really over, most of the reapers are killed by Richard alone, and if he has not repeatedly protected Mex was already dead under the reaper's high-energy beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex dragged his bruised body, grabbed a flesh-and-blood warrior, and endured nausea, according to the method of Richard, put them under the barrel The metal box is picked up, and the inside of the little finger is removed, and the faintly shiny metal is emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked in her hand, the metal is very soft, and a handprint will appear when it is pinched. And it's a bit hot, and there's a strange tingling sensation in his hand that makes Mex feel a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will hurt you if you take it for a long time. Before you reach the legend, you better control your curiosity a little." Richard's voice It came from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
