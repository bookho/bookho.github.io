I can see the answer from your eyes. Forget it, this is not what I should interfere with, but I want to tell you that here is dark blue, The field of Your Highness. If you encounter anything unpleasant, you can find me or complain directly to your Highness. Dark blue is the world of magicians, and the hands of secular rights cannot reach here. If the dispute you encounter involves too More outside the world, then my advice is to inform the news to your father. The power of the Akmon family will make many people jealous, and the Marquis of Gordon has recently begun to settle in the legendary capital of Faust. Standing on Faust, it represents enough comprehensive strength and strength to stand on the peak of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s eyes are on one side, and a good one Yes, I said, "I don't want to use the power of the Marquis of Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years of wisdom let Phil hear the little secret that Richard revealed from the title, but he is not surprised. People associated with the name of Archimonde are very ‘personal.’ Of course, if you look at the mainland, there are actually a lot of similar families, such as St. Peter, Wismar, Agames, Solomon, Julius and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair nodded and said: "In fact, I still have one last doubt, that is wisdom. The art of killing transcends the limitations of the field and leads you to see To the possibility of cross-disciplinary, but to integrate all the forty-six basic disciplines involved in the magical structure, not only genius, it takes a long time of diligence and true wisdom, is wisdom, Not smart. And you, Richard, wisdom in the dark blue is not the most prominent. I originally thought that you would not be able to build your own magic structure when you were fifteen, but you are It was very unreasonable when I was in my early twelfth year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Phil also knows that this is an unanswered question. The fact is that Richard has indeed taken the first step that is crucial for all the builders. This is the reality, it exists, that is, qualified, regardless of the reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil, who studies the philosophy of magic, is very clear that there must be reasons behind the phenomenon. If you can’t find it, it’s not without it, but you can’t see it. . There are too many secrets in Noland. The universe composed of countless planes can never be fully explored. Therefore, even a boring god suddenly instilled the whole set of knowledge of the architects. It is not absurd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, St. Peter, who created the armed forces of the heavens in history, revealed that most of his inspiration was actually derived from the gods before his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil stood up and carefully collected the 'primary agile' and then said to Richard: "Okay, don't waste time on small problems. Whatever the reason, in fact, your breakthrough is largely due to luck. Luck is always a very important part of strength, and the more it goes to the end."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a moment, Master Phil said with deep meaning: "Richard, maybe you still don't know how lucky you are. But this is a semi-public secret, and does not require special confidentiality. Now is the time to tell you. There is a habit in His Highness Su Hailun, that is, in each field of magic, only one student will eventually be retained to officially continue her inheritance. As the most dazzling pearl in the magic crown, the decoration This is especially true of the division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?" Richard suddenly understood that why he felt hostile from Stevenson and Minnie. And Randolph, who had nothing to do with, would be a conspiracy to kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, at least Stevenson is determined to develop in the direction of the builder, and his will is firm. But now you are in front of him, and it is a decisive step. So I just told you if In the future, there will be unsolvable disputes and how to deal with them. In addition, you should pay attention to your own safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha heard the words of Phil’s master It means that it is still unbelievable: "It can be dark blue here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Master smiled and said: "The more powerful rules are only used Constraining sensible people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and thought, nodded and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the old magician has packed up the things, and the students who have gathered have arrived, so he said to Richard: "Now come with me, good luck. Little Richard, I will show you the ability of the builder to create a miracle. I believe that after reading it, you will have a deeper understanding of the world of the builders. Not just stay in those half-and-a-half False deeds and autobiography."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour later, Richard and Phil were already sitting in a magical experimental field outside the dark blue. This is an open-air huge experimental field that can test the power of super-large magic and even legendary spells, and can also be used as a colosseum to test the newly discovered Warcraft or the newly created summoning creature power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s gaze, a violent armored horse was placed in the experimental field. Iron armor is a kind of World of Warcraft near the dark blue. It is much taller than the ordinary horse. The back of the body is covered with a layer of hard scale like steel. The temper is extremely violent and there is no possibility of domestication. Its powerful iron hoof can smash the skull of the polar ice bear. The speed of running and the height of a jump are comparable to the Mars deer, so there are few natural enemies. The most valuable thing about the Iron Armor is that it is stronger than the known metal, but the weight is like the scale of the light feather, and it can be easily enchanted without too complicated processing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the violent movements of all kinds of fiercely captured Warcraft, entering the venue has to go through a long narrow black road. As soon as the armored horse entered the experimental field, the sudden opening of the space suddenly made it pause. This is a huge venue with a square kilometer radius, which is covered with various terrains. After many trials, the residual magical atmosphere and a lot of old bloodstains of Warcraft suddenly made the armored horse into the most alert state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the Iron Armor paused, Richard saw the entire scale of the armored horse chest and removed a whole piece, and the 'primary agility' The end is exactly embedded there. This is certainly not a simple mosaic. The animal skin has undergone a special tailoring process, and it needs to be finely manipulated to be placed in the corresponding position of Warcraft. At this moment, with the gradual heavy weight of the armored horse, the magical pattern of the chest inlaid on it is gradually shining. This is the symbol that the magic pattern has absorbed the magic of the armored horse and started to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the stimulation of rich blood, the armored horse suddenly became violent! It stood up and made a long sigh, then landed on four hooves and started to run like a thunder! Looking at its route, it is to continuously jump over the obstacles piled up by the two logs, and then forcibly break through the fence of the experimental field and regain freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment when the armored horse vacated, the magical pattern suddenly made a dazzling light! The armored horse has exerted an amazing potential and jumped extremely high. Not only has it jumped far beyond the first obstacle, but it has also hit the second obstacle directly! This is the jump, the straight line distance is nearly half farther than the ordinary iron armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood chips are flying, the heavy logs are smashed by the armored horses, and the one-and-a-half-meter-diameter logs are the most stressed, almost breaking the waist! The Iron Armor also obviously slammed into a whirlwind, and turned around in a hurry. He could not find a direction at the moment and began to run around in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
