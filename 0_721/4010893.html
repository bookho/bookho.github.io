"The voice of Stevenson, fluttering like a candle swaying in the wind, he looked at the dagger in disbelief, then look at Minnie, then look at the dagger." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of his body is rapidly escaping, and the chill is coming, letting him fight a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Stevenson suddenly became very calm and sober. He saw Minnie’s eyes clear and calm, and her voice was the same. Calm, although the face is swollen, I can hardly see the original look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that from the moment you climbed onto me, I wanted to insert this dagger into your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson barely believes in his own ears, but this is what Minnie said, his vision is dimming, all the scenery is gradually blurred, the cold has penetrated The bone marrow, and it becomes the only feeling of the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson vaguely felt that he was falling on the ground, and then he was stunned by something, and then, it was complete. dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha led the Archimonde fighter back to the Marquis of Brahms, and the speed of the army was naturally incomparable to that of him alone, so The road of 100 kilometers still has to go for two days, not to mention the fact that there are still many wounded in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this night, when Richard’s camp was resting, he suddenly came to a visitor who surprised him, Minnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini is even a legend, and there is no threat to Richard, not to mention that she only has sixteen, so Richard saw her directly in her camp, only Senma is accompanied by the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Minnie, who appeared in front of her eyes, surprised Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a bruised face and a striking wound on her nose. Apparently her nose is broken and her left eye is swollen with only a slit. The corners of the eyes are all dry blood, and her right hand is softly hanging beside her, the arm is unnaturally twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's pupils shrank and asked: "Sidvinson hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He revealed a cold smile and said, "It seems that I have to give him some more lessons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini said calmly: "No need Because I have killed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was the turn of Richard to be shocked: "You killed him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened ten hours ago." Minnie was as calm as a trivial little thing, not just the heir to a legendary duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and asked, "Then you come to me now, what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I want to be your woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechahe smiled and replied unceremoniously: "Impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini laughed at herself and said, "Of course I know that it is impossible. Just just joking, just try your mind, just say it, I want you to protect me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection" Richard is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I killed Sidvinson, the Duke of Soram will not let me go, Richard, you will not be afraid of the Duke of Soram, so I beg you for protection so that I can survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The price, this thing, the price is not cheap."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie said: "I know, I am a 16th-level wizard. I have never dared to surpass Stevenson before, so I try to lower my level. If you are willing to give me some resources. Soon I will become a big magician, you should know that the command of His Highness, Helen, even if it is a self-funded student, she will not be free to include it, so in terms of talent, you can be assured of me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "I agree with this, and there is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you need it, I can go to your bed at any time. My technique is quite good." Minnie is as calm as saying that she is eating and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "It seems that Stevenson has done a lot of training for you. Senma, what do you think."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summa spread his hand and said: "Soram is not in trouble for us. If we put the person who killed Sidvinson, I am afraid he should be mad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said, "This is also true, okay, Minnie, you will stay, anyway, how many wizards are there? Not too much, you just have to do things for me, and the rest don't have to worry. I will send someone to inform Soram tomorrow. You are by my side. If he feels that he has the ability, if he comes over, try to see if he can kill. Lost you, the next time his luck will not be so good, I can escape from my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini is shocked, she knows that Richard is strong However, I did not expect it to be so powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Dragon Wing Castle, the Marquis of Brahms was restless again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a very limited channel of information and his own observations, the Marquis knows that Richard has left the city, leading Archimonde to the north, this trip The purpose is obvious, the sacred dynasty and the church's army have arrived, and Richard is to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast between the two sides is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dynasty party is dominated by the Church Knights led by St. Thomas, including a total of 10,000 Holy White Knights, and the private leaders of the various lords are also joined together. More than 300,000, so that the military is one place, the military strength is ten times more than Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard is a legendary mage, St. Thomas is also a legendary paladin. Although the old knight lived more than three hundred years old, it is still only 21, but the long years Even if it does not bring about an increase in strength, but the combat experience will increase with rì. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from a few days ago, the Marquis became anxious again, nervously waiting for good news, only to see the strength of the two sides, the Marquis knew that there could be no What bad news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But somehow, since the passage of the Archbishop of Lufide, the communication law in the castle was completely silenced and no news was received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis waited for two days, and then couldn’t stand it. He moved the chair and sat next to the communication magic array waiting for the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication magic array did not move, but the Marquis’s guards brought the latest news, and the sentinel saw Archimonde’s army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a force that’s still less than a million people, and it’s coming from the far side of the Dragon Wing Castle. It looks like they’ve just experienced a terrible battle. Many people still have injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 30,000 people went out and 10,000 people came back. It seems that Archimonde has been hit hard, but Brahms is too late to be happy. The dynasty sent hundreds of thousands of troops with legendary pressures, how can it let Archimonde escape 10,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis immediately stood up and said to the guard: "Go, take me to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Marquis of Brahms hurriedly boarded the tower, it was just that Richard led a team of knights to the Dragon Wing Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Brahms immediately changed, because he saw the formation of the entire team, and also saw that Richard began to take off, which proves that Richard can Fighting, and finally, although the number of Archimonde troops was greatly reduced, the military capacity was still strict, and the Marquis was far-sighted and could not see the army of the dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current Archimonde army, it’s more than enough to lay down the Dragon Wing Castle, and the Marquis no longer thinks that he is a 20,000 warrior in the castle. Able to keep Archimonde's offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the war symbol xìng, also symbolizes the end of xìng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent three minutes singing the spell, and then opened the door of the Dragon Wing Castle with a legendary nuclear burst, proving himself As the legendary Master, the strength was not damaged, and at the same time, nearly 100 guard soldiers on the tower were sent to the Kingdom of Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Brahms then announced his surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance has been completely meaningless, and Richard is unstoppable, not to mention that this legendary mage still carries nearly a hundred pose knights, and tens of thousands of sharp-eyed Archimonde fighters are not the Marquis’s private army guards. Able to resist, unnecessary resistance, will only cause a heavy disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha walked into the Chamber of Deliberation of Brahms, and the knights flocked in like water, standing on both sides of the hall, and Richard I walked up the high platform along the scarlet carpet and sat down on the exclusive seat of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important members of the Brahms family have entered the hall one after another and stood at the designated location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They watched the knights in two rows, all in fear, they never saw such a knight at the same time, light It is the pressure of power, let the weaker people breathe hard, and the gorgeous female knight standing beside Richard is involuntarily thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis has not yet appeared. He asked the observer through the guard: he needs half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard sat in his seat and waited patiently. Half an hour later, the dressed Marquis of Brahms appeared. He dressed as if Going to the emperor’s banquet, standing in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s elbows were on the armrests, looking down at Brahms, and slowly said, “The Marquis, we met again.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms said: "I really don't want this way, what are you going to do, here is the territory of the sacred dynasty, and I am the dynasty Marquis, your current move is tantamount to provoking the entire sacred dynasty, and the dynasty will give punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looked at Brahm with interest At this time, the Marquis is still unwilling to admit defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Marquis, as a nobleman, I admire your courage, but your wisdom is not worthy of compliments, maybe I am provoking the sacred dynasty, and holy The tree dynasty really wants to punish me, but unfortunately, I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brahms is really shocked this time: "You, you Win, how is it possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
