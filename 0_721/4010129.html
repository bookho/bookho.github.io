As long as the time lighthouse is established and a certain grace is paid, the Eternal and Time Dragon can extract specific fragments from the past history of the plane, form materials, and present them in the book of Time. For example, now I see, Not only the history of the Jubvar troll capital, but also the words of the troll civilization during this period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...some historical data too Want to pay for God's grace?" Richard's face was a bit strange. The dragon of eternal and time can actually use it to sell money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. In the process of conquering the plane, the mastery of the history of the plane itself is very important, and it is related to whether it can overcome the initial difficulties and integrate it into place. Within the system, and to lay the foundation for the ultimate conquest of the entire plane. The importance of these materials is much more important than several knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can refute, but Richard does not think so. Such a plane as Faro has a long history, and there are hundreds of millions of years of existence. There have been many civilizations that have appeared. For example, the area of ​​Zhubwal is just an insignificant little point in the entire plane. If these historical materials require grace, even if they pay less, the gods of the entire plane's history need to be brought together, but it is a huge number beyond imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Richard turned his mind and found that the eternal and timeless dragon’s grace is omnipotent. For both sides of the war, the one with the grace and the one without the grace are completely unequal wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the soldiers who had spent the rest of the night continued to go. After a day of trek, they finally stood on the edge of Zhubwal before the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you see it, Richard is shocked by the grandeur of the troll capital!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The huge ladder is directly cut out in the center of the mountain. It is made up of megaliths. Each step is nearly one meter high and the width is as high as 50 meters. The steps are divided into left and right sides, separated by a layer of stone benches. The stone platform is engraved with a totem of flames, sun and behemoths. There is also a stone inscribed brazier at every other distance. It was only because of the long time that all the carvings were severely weathered and somewhat blurred. The entire troll capital is built on the mountain. At regular heights, the gentle slope will be flattened and become a platform for living. From the bottom up, there are more than 30 platforms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the ladder, at the very top of the entire troll capital stands a pyramid-shaped altar of more than 70 meters. Even from the foot of the mountain, you can feel the grandeur and majesty of the altar! I really don't know how many times the trolls spent thousands of years before they built this miraculous troll capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha narrowed his eyes and found that if you look at it from a distance, the layout of the entire troll city is equivalent to a huge altar. . There was a faint mist in the dilapidated buildings, and the air shook with screaming shouts. After entering Jubwal, you can feel the humid atmosphere in the air. As the sand is expected, it seems that this troll has regained its water. There is not only moisture in the air, but also a strong rot, like the smell of swamps. However, the sharp-minded Richard sniffed a scent of ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha waved his hand and the knights dismounted and began to guard. Richard handed the nameless knife to an elite humanoid warrior, and he himself was extinct and walked into the military camp where the soldiers were stationed on both sides of the ladder. The two ruins have long since been abandoned, and the slab-covered roof has collapsed, and the pillars standing still standing are covered with vines and moss. The troll's in-room facilities are simple, the wooden utensils have long since decayed, and only the stone fire pits in each house are intact. Thousands of iron spears were thrown in the camp and they had long been rusted. Richard picked up a look and saw that the tip of the rust spear was broken into two pieces on his hand. It seems that there is nothing to be desired from material to forging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard shook his head and continued to walk in the military camp. When he reached a broken wall, Richard suddenly smelled a faint smell of rancid smell. He stopped and looked at the place where the smell was floating. As a result, under the brick at the root of the wall, he found a strange dark gray moss. . The mossy surface is thick with white hair and looks like the corpse on the carrion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of Richard, some of the information learned from the dark blue, but not sure, so he turned back and said: "Sandru! Come and see these things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undead Master came over and looked at the moss in the corner and said with certainty: "Yes, these are the cemetery moss. They will only be in the undead." The place where the breath is strong will grow, and it usually appears in the cemetery where there are undead activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is there an undead creature activity here?" Richard became serious. In an abandoned city like the Troll Capital, once a large number of undead creatures appear, it is very likely that there will be quite high-level undead. Such things as the Lich, but there is the potential to advance to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru carefully inspected the cemetery moss and said with certainty: "There must be no dead creatures here, and it was not long ago. I can feel To the undead atmosphere they left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Then we have to be careful. Just in case, summon two blacks. Warriors come out. There may be some places where you need to use them to explore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead mage nodded and went outside the ruins of the military camp and began to summon the black warriors. . In a few consecutive battles, the number of undead creatures under the Undead Master has been greatly expanded. There are now more than two hundred black warriors transformed, and the death knight also has three rides. After the undead mage was strengthened, the number of black warriors who could maintain the activity at the same time rose to fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll capital has undead activities, which makes Richard more vigilant, but not afraid. In this team, he is equipped with an oversized priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the military camp, the sand found a stone monument, and after erasing the surface of the moss, most of the handwriting engraved on it was still legible. The sand was not deciphered on the spot, but a blank scroll was taken and the scroll was activated to print the inscription. After standing in the sand, Richard was also watching the stone. Although the ancient troll text was supplemented with the sand, but the time was too short, Richard could only vaguely see that the content of this inscription seems to be related to the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this said?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reel in the hand of the sand sprayed a ray of light on the stone tablet, and a complete troll inscription appeared on the reel after a while. After a while, he said: "This is a verse about how to sacrifice Zuka. This stone is only the first step. Well, Zuka seems to be a kind of Holy Spirit for this troll city sacrifice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I have found traces of dying here, be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand does not mean it, smiles and pats the pocket, says: "There are more than twenty magic scrolls here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ruins of the two outposts were quickly searched. Nothing was found except the stone. After the whole team was finished, the soldiers of a small team stayed at the ladder and walked to the depths of Zhu Buval. But just stepping on the ladder, Richard's unicorn suddenly stopped, uneasily raking the ground with his hoof, and squatting low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
