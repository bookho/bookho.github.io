			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional is the soul of Calando, the ancestor is the source of courage and wisdom of the tribe people. For thousands of years, the barbarian has used this as a cornerstone to step through every corner of Calando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uza Lazu thought for a moment and asked: "But this will make the simple tribes fall. They will lose courage, frankness, and will become Nolan The Germans are ashamed and untrustworthy. They will lie and deceive. What should we do then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea faintly said: "When holy When the team of the tree dynasty came to Calando, what was the practice of the temple in the same way as the Noland? The tribe had already fallen, not now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Uzzarazu’s old face was slightly red, and he couldn’t help but sigh when he remembered the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell the people who know this to the tribes. Don't give the knowledge and ability to the elders and the temple. Let the people They decide the path they want to go, instead of following the guidance of the ancestors who have lived for tens of thousands of years. In the future, after a brief period of chaos and degeneration, they will know the boundaries between ** and temperance, and will form new ones. Tradition and virtue. I believe that creation and wisdom will replace courage and sacrifice, and the coercive contract will replace unguaranteed loyalty and become a new faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountains and the sea are very slow and slow, and every sentence is the result of her deduction. The huge computing power of the nest makes her a vision of the future. This is a new future, a future that the Kalando barbarian can't imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzzarazu and Asa have some suffocation for a while. Even if they are already strong, they cannot imagine the situation of breaking the tradition and not obeying the orders of the ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all over. At the foot of the Great Sacrifice, the bloody character array was lit up. It was already at the scheduled time, and the elders started the returning array. When the three left, the turbulent land became quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the mountains and the sea stood for a while and returned to the mother's nest. The mother's nest finally started to move. It climbed a short distance and left a two-meter-high dark golden dome in the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the giant egg appeared, the abdomen's abdomen was significantly smaller, and it was very weak on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in the nest forest, there are a pair of eyes with curiosity, watching all this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Little Fleur, she’s now a 10-year-old girl. Because it is the body that was reborn by the mother's nest, Freire's breath is naturally the same as that of the nest forest, so Asa and others have not noticed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark golden giant egg stood still for a moment, suddenly began to shake, cracked on the eggshell, and then ruptured, revealing a girl inside the body. The girl slowly opened her eyes and she was born exactly like the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike the mountains and seas before the fusion, her skin is painted with red, brown and white. In particular, her cheeks were painted with two ribbons, just like when I saw Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not a decoration, but a genuine saint totem, the oldest, strongest and simplest totem of the saints in the Great Snow Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saint totem hidden in the Snow Mountain Temple has a will of the beast god, so it is extremely powerful. When the mountains and the sea left Calando, the Totem of the Holy Spirit was washed away, and the will of the beast was left in the Temple of Snow Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, this set of saint totems appears on this new girl and is even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked at the saint totem on her body and drew a few circles by hand, making a move in the air. There was a dark cloud in the sky and it began to rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rain, the girl washed the mucus from her body and then dispersed the dark clouds. Her body was so hot that she evaporated all the drops of water, then sat down on a big tree and began to silently make a small braid on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, Richard put a whole box of embers on the altar, but did not wait for the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon. In this option of sacrifice, I did not see any omniscience related to the nest and the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two active Ember essences, what Richard can choose is just a variety of materials and equipment, and there is obviously no close to the second-order god in these things. En material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest gain of the sacrifice was the acquisition of two drops of the essence of the embers, and with the last one, Richard could revitalize more than a dozen pieces of legendary equipment into artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally activated three pieces of artifacts, leaving ten times the amount of activated embers and the legends and quasi-legends that were exchanged with sacrifices. Equipment, back to Faro. This sacrifice made Richard understand that most of the battle with the Reaper could only be on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Faro, the point battlefield has been ineffective, except for the followers of Richard, the foreign strong ones are gone. In the third war, up to one-third of the casualties were completely cold and the courage of these powerful people. All the strong people gathered in the two battlefields of the dragon and the abyss. For a time, Richard’s power in Faro was exceptionally empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evacuation of these powerful men also brought the real battle of Faro back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After overnight, almost all the families knew that Archimonde’s local army in Faro was almost dead and wounded, and the special army lost more than half. There used to be only a few hundred rides, and there were several strong players, including even the most sturdy legendary killer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining these news, the demise of Archimonde seems to have become inevitable. For a time, many people’s hearts began to move. The secret of the super fifth-order configuration of the Midrande battle version is so tempting enough to make people lose their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s past powers are still there. Even if the family’s strength is lost, the strength of the superpower is enough to make people think twice. But the super strong is not all. In the secret of some big forces, some people finally took risks and started to start with Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned to Faro, he knew the news that the mother's nest was temporarily safe. This is very simple, because he has returned to Faro, but there is no need to share the pain. Explain that, at least for the time being, the mother's nest suppressed the reaper's control instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that nothing has changed before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-arranged the line of defense, then joined the hunting force and started a squadron that ran off the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, time passes by bit by bit. Richard continued to disband the old hunting team, and set up a new hunting team to destroy the reaper's squad one by one. The mountains and the sea have also been with Richard in two huntings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sense of Richard, the barbarian girl did change. She became more reticent, her power increased significantly, and her attacks were simpler, more rude, and more efficient. Now that the strength of the mountains and the sea is strong, it is perfectly possible to fight against Richard and not fall into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to understand why the girl’s strength has increased so much in such a short period of time. After asking for no results, Richard can only attribute this to the beast The strength of the blood, can actually awaken the fighting instinct and fighting skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad of the reaper seems to be simple, but it is extremely dangerous. Although the number of reapers in these detachments is small, the quality is far more than that. The number of medium-sized fighters in the detachment is even larger than that of small fighters, and one of the miniature fighters is invisible. It seems that the reapers have also begun to take the road of elite soldiers and gradually phase out the backward arms with insufficient power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a high-level reaper, even Richard must be careful, and one can be hit if he is not careful. If it is hit by a high-energy beam, even Richard will suffer minor injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless battles, the pursuit of no breaks, and the danger of a slight oversight and death will make Richard both physically and mentally exhausted. Other followers are even more difficult to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When chasing the eighth detachment, the legendary killer who had always been unruly and sturdy was not careful enough, and he was directly hit by a main battleship, his The upper body immediately evaporated from the air, and the soul immediately dissipated, and there was no possibility of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard immediately destroyed the warship, he reported half of his hatred, but the reapers were destroyed and more than just machinery, they have no soul. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard pursued the Tenth Reaper squad, two large reaper corps suddenly appeared, one attacked the turbulent land, another One bypassed the No. 1 battlefield and appeared directly outside the Blue Water Oasis City. So in the country of the deep red kingdom, there was an extremely fierce attack and defense war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard rushed back to Oasis, the war was coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
