			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick gun barrel of ten meters long points to the front, and the rough shape is the arrogant domineering! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty nights elf warriors have joined forces to push it to the gun, and then several night elves Druid will cooperate with the wizards, one will A two-meter-long giant tailless wing-shaped artillery shell was filled inside, and then the rear gun door was heavily buckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Master and the Druids then began to aim, and filled a piece of magic crystal into the card slot of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the fleet slowly sailed to the far side of the deep blue sea. This distance has entered the scope of the magical warship's stun gun attack, and the special large-powered long-range rifle can even directly hit the deep blue tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven giant ships are lined up in a row, which is the combat team type for the standard of the sea fleet. On the deck of the giant ship, you can see that ash-like dwarfs like ants are pushing a large exaggerated gun to the side deck facing the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magicians are not flustered at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue is extremely strong and has strong defensive protection. It is impossible to open the dark blue façade by the rifle, and at most it is to play a few holes. If you want to capture the dark blue, you must send a combat team to land, break into the dark blue, and destroy all the dark blue guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard, who has already freed his hand from the Reaper War, has a strong defense force in the dark blue where there is no place to lose. It’s astounding. Even if the polar mainland sends in 10 integrated main army regiments, it is guaranteed that there will be no return. This fleet can transport more combat teams, but not two or three main army groups. This type of attack is indeed coming to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold suddenly said: "Bet! You said that my baby can smash a big iron shell in a few times?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hanging."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bet your baby will burst within three times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet the first to burst!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black gold violently thundered, there was a very loud voice suddenly coming from the fleet below: "Black gold! Are you old things that don't know the numbers yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as I heard this voice, the black gold face suddenly turned into a strange look that couldn’t be said to be horrified. He ran all the way to the platform and looked down. I saw a gray dwarf standing on the bridge of the central flagship, which is quite similar to the appearance of black gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold screams with some anger: "Anger of the Thunder! You don't honestly hit the iron in your dog's hole, what are you doing here, die?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey dwarf named Ang Lei’s anvil laughed and said, “I came over to see you! I heard that you are well mixed in dark blue, when you were young. Even if the numbers are unclear, you can actually keep accounts! God, your brain has to be smashed by the hammer, can you become so smart! Have you seen these big babies under my feet? It’s my outstanding work, how is it, is it good? Do you want to leave the dark blue and go back to the tribe with me? You are careful that the two of your Highness have found that your account is missing, throwing you into the ice floe to feed the shark!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the anvil has a very fast speech rate, and the amount of information is large enough. At one time, the black gold is at a loss, and does not know where to start the rebuttal. The other big magicians looked at Black Gold's eyes naturally and some of them were wrong. The guy who served as the financial officer of Dark Blue for decades, wouldn't even have the most basic mathematics when he was a child? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be true. Otherwise, Black Gold immediately threw the rebuttal words on the other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold is not a general anger, he shouted and shouted: "I will let you see the power of my latest research baby! Master We are ready to launch! Aiming... Damn, not this boat, change one! Head or tail... Damn! Any one, as long as it is not in the middle!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gold is on the edge of the platform, yelling at the turret below, the big magisters have quietly retreated to the rear, away from the black gold The infamous cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the development of Raytheon, Black Gold has become fascinated with gunpowder and metal, and combined them with the magic array, eventually creating dozens of large and small Weird firearms. However, the ambition of Black Gold swelled faster. He was not satisfied with the variant of Raytheon. On the basis of the power metal sent by Richard, he began to study Raytheon, which has been magnified several times in all respects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf's cannon is bigger and bigger, but it has never been successful, but it often blows up the laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a big hand suddenly shot on the black gold shoulder, and then a thick voice came: "If your baby is really effective, put the magical battleship ordered by His Royal Highness." It’s so heavy, I think you’re going to work and pay debts for the rest of your life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold was shocked and turned around and saw it was an iron shield. This legendary warrior is now a famous legendary strongman under Richard Richard, and his reputation is closely followed by followers such as Splash and Zonghu. He followed Richard and finished the war with the Reaper, and the trust he gained was naturally extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Black Gold’s surprise is not the sudden appearance of Iron Shield, but the content of his words: “You mean, these are the battleships of His Royal Highness Richard. But why did they hang the flag of the parliament and put on a fighting stance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield showed some awkward laughs and said: "Nature is some The less well-meaning guys want to stir up things. Now the three empires have no such stupid people, but it’s hard to say outside the human empire. Ok, let me give it to me, I will make these idiots smarter. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold hurriedly pulled the iron shield and shouted: "Wait a minute! Your Royal Highness, the...the anvil of the wrath below It’s my younger brother. He doesn’t know anything other than iron. In this fleet, he certainly has no commanding position. Where does this idiot know what command ship!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The anvil of anger is right, ok, I will be measured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Shield However jumped down from the platform edge, went flying sea fleet. The gray dwarves and orc sailors in the fleet suddenly became confused, and many rifles immediately rose and locked the iron shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield is not afraid, the momentum of the legendary strongman rises to the sky, and the voice screams like a thunder: "Who is the commander, give me Get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sly orc came out of the flagship bridge and also rose into the air, saying: "It's me, the orc warrior Tanter Lei. The blade!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield glanced at the orc who was just the sanctuary of the district, sneer: "President Li Chau ordered from the shadow prince This fleet is for you to play with? What are you counting? If you break a ship, you will be able to sell all of your family and you can’t afford it?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc was furious and suddenly showed two long fangs and roared: "Stupid human, do you dare to insult the orc warrior?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid The human?" Iron Shield sneered a few times, suddenly asked: "The shadow prince let you raise the flag of the parliament and continue to open to the dark blue? Let you put a battle formation here? Let you point all the guns to dark blue ?狂刃! Is this what you mean or the meaning of the shadow prince?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield’s drink suddenly makes a slap in the face, he said with a hard scalp: "Who meant what, what is the difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course there is a difference!" The voice of Iron Shield suddenly softened, saying: "His Royal Highness said This time, receiving the warship may be a bit unsatisfactory. So anyone who has trouble, no matter who it is, will kill it. If it is the Shadow Prince, then the Highness will personally dismantle the old guy's nest!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The razor blade listened a little sluggish and pointed to the iron shield and said, "You... you dare to the prince "I don't respect it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disrespect?" The iron shield suddenly burst into laughter, and the laughter rang through the bay, and it was a dizzy, almost a bite. Blood spouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big laughter, the iron shield said: "What shadow prince is just a legend, and he has not heard of any great battles he has participated in for decades. I don't know if I still remember how to fight. A legend in the district is that I can also clean up him when I go, and I still need to take my own personal attention?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With the last anger of the Iron Shield, the razor blade only felt his head as if it was hit by a giant hammer. It was planted in the air and hung on the deck of the battleship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The razor-riding orc guards rushed forward, and took a closer look, suddenly stagnating on the spot. The blade is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was confronted with the Iron Shield for a while, and was squandered by the Iron Shield, and he was killed by alive! He is a holy domain brave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron shield glanced down coldly and said, "Hand over! Be careful, don't break the battleship of your Highness."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angle of the Thunder to see the body of the blade, and look at the iron shield, suddenly shouted: "You actually killed the blade! Is it not afraid of causing war?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
