			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning and the moment are all awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the failure to compete for the deep blue dominance, they have made their position very complicated and subtle at this moment. They actually have the heart to join, but Richard does not have a special invitation at all, and obviously, Richard feels that there is no difference between them and no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold, Phil, and a group of great mentors have no concerns about leaving and leaving, and they promised to join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the end, the beginning and the beginning did not pull down to ask for permission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, they went to the delivery platform and looked at each other and found that the other person was as depressed as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher's business can't be counted like this! I plan to go and trace it myself." The first time sèyīn said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will also follow up, but it is not with Richard." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and sent away in their own way. They are quite silent when they go compared to the sounds of the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the dark blue conference room, Richard brought together a group of great magisters and began to check all the activities before Su Hailun’s departure, including who he met. , what information was received, etc., no details have been let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Richard got the information he needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a visit to a legendary wizard named Blatter, it was not long before Su Hailun left with him and never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Check out this Blatter and find out all his information. I hope to see them tonight," Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are not good at big mentors, but many of Richard's followers and newcomers are good at this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They contacted some underground organizations that depended on trafficking for information through their own channels, and they quickly got a response, and then summarized their respective intelligences in Li Before the time limit for the request, the information about Blatter was finally put in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very detailed piece of information. After hundreds of thousands of gold coins have been spent, the power is quite impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information includes Blatter’s latest strengths, some important stories, known legendary abilities and legendary magic. In addition, his family situation, blood power, teacher and students, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read it word by word and read it three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has come, covering the entire Noland. What is rising tonight is the moon of blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of ordinary people, dinner has already been used, it is to read a book in front of a warm fireplace, have a cup of tea, and then prepare to enter the wonderful The moment of dreaming. But for some upper-level people, this night is destined to be a storm night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several amazing news quickly spread through every corner of Noland through the communication magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important message is the guardian of the Holy Alliance, the recognized superpower Su Hailun has an accident, missing in the void in the depths of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is actually equivalent to announcing that she has fallen, because the legendary wizard has many means to connect with his mage tower or semi-position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connection between the souls is the most mysterious and most difficult to cut off. There are countless dangers in the depths of the void, but only the ones that can cut off the soul. Just a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the most dangerous places, and no one will come close there without special reasons. Even with the power of Su Helun, once they enter the dangerous places, people will think that she is more and more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving this news, the first reaction of many big lords was that the Holy Alliance now has only one superpower of the undecided Queen, and the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire have two or more superpowers. Another reaction is that Archimonde's biggest patron is gone, so what is the qualification of Archimonde between the three empires to maintain dú lì? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Empire, when Prince Tumen read the news, he pondered for a moment and asked the elders and generals who were temporarily summoned: "How are you?" Look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best time to accept Archimonde. The 10th sire of Su Hailun has fallen, in those places, I have never heard of someone coming in and can come out. Without the support of the superpower, Richard Archimond can't maintain the status of dú lì, and relying on our Millennium Empire is his best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another elder also said: "This is true. But Richard is very young, young people, xìng is easy to be so arrogant. We must pay attention to the way when persuading him, A milder one would be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A general of the generals frowned and said, "With the honor of His Royal Highness, is it still polite to him?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former elder snorted and said unceremoniously: "Is Richard's current status? "It's worse than the Prince's Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" The general took the case and couldn't make it. The elders said the truth, and the Prince of Tumen never boasted the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the elders who are over forty years old said slowly: "Okay, don't quarrel! If you can win the Highness of Richard, then It is worthwhile for us to pay any price. I think that in order to express our sincerity, we can consider marrying Mex to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal comes out, Everyone was silent. The status of the elders is also faintly above the Prince of Tumen, and the generation is four generations higher than the Prince of Tumen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen glanced at Meeks and smiled and said, "What is your opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mex is ill: "If the family makes a decision, then I am willing to sacrifice for the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Tumen smiled and said: "Li Cha is not an ordinary person. It is not a sacrifice to marry him. However, I have a different opinion. You have thought about it. Under normal circumstances, this news should be blocked. A super It is normal for the strong to go to explore the plane, and it will be normal for a few years or even decades. Why did Richard disclose the news directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone in the room is full of wisdom. When they think about it, everyone is surprised. They talk about it: "Does he think that even without Su Hailun, Archimonde can maintain dú lì?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion is really amazing. If this is the case, it means that there is still a superpower in the Archimonde family, or at least the power to compete against the superpower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every superpower has the ability to change the continent. Then the message from this message is very intriguing. At this time, the prince’s bodyguard knocked on the door and sent several pieces of information marked as the most important level to the hands of the Prince of Tumen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince silently read, his face sè dignified, he handed the information to the elders, and then circulated. When the last general was finished watching, the atmosphere in the conference room had become very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex first broke the silence: "He...he is crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, maybe not." Prince Tumen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a shocking news, Richard issued a wanted for all scholars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who can provide a clue to a scholar's mage and be confirmed can receive a reward of one million gold coins from the Archimonde family. If you can kill a scholar's mage and get it, then according to the level of the scholar's mage, the bounty will increase to between 3 million and 10 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a huge reward, it is very rare to look at the entire Noland, even the legendary strong will be heartbroken. I believe that there will be many powerful people who are tempted by the wind. Even if they don’t always think of the mysterious and powerful scholars, their three-footed action will at least add a lot of trouble to the scholars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is shocking is not only the huge bounty, but also the object of Richard’s reward: the scholar mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon's Scholar Master is a mysterious and powerful organization. It is always hidden behind the scenes of the dark, and most of the members are actively absorbed by the scholars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of Scholars has many ancient heritages, and the rich knowledge makes them the most dangerous enemy under any circumstances. The location of Solomon Castle is still a mystery, even if the royal family of the three empire does not have this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People understand the Master of Scholars, and more are the magical suits designed by Solomon. This set is known for its numerous features, although each feature is not very powerful, but if used properly, it can perform unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Set can be said to be the grace of the Masters, but it is obviously more suitable for the fighting style of the scholars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Richard’s fifth-order magical armor was released, the Magic Magic Set has always been the most desirable structure for the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that even the Prince of Tumen is not willing to provoke a behemoth like a scholar. And Richard is open to all scholars, and this is equivalent to fighting with Solomon Castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard rises like a comet and climbs the highest peak of the entire Noland community, but against the scholars, he also Lack of the most important accumulation. Therefore, the elders and generals, including the Prince of Tumen, are not optimistic about the prospects of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, St. Martin has read the same content and is walking back and forth in his very simple study. He also got another piece of information, that is, the horrific force that Richard showed in the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Martin’s double eyebrows are still tightly locked together. In his opinion, it’s just to rely on this strength of the face, to deal with the scholar’s ​​master. Far from enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Richard has a card? St. Martin thought, but after sinking, he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulation time of Richard is too short. In such a short period of time, how to expand the strength is limited, and the forces that swell in this way must have A small hidden danger. Even Martin can conclude that there must have been a scholar mages mixed into Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
