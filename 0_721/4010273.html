			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at two followers fighting in the martial arts field, Richard It seems that they are also infected by them, and their hearts are filled with vitality and vitality, and even the urge to play a game. Gangde took Tiramisu hiding in the thick shell, but it did not mean that Richard could not do anything. For example, lightning is the nemesis of heavy metal armor. The equipment of tiramisu is still relatively simple. At present, it is purely in the thickness of metal, and there are no other attributes attached. In addition, the power of the breath that Richard blows can easily penetrate the armor without additional magic resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and stopped looking at the results, but walked to his place of residence. It’s really good to see the followers getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that a lot of burdens in his heart were quietly put down. He returned to his home and told him that there was no important thing, no one was allowed to bother, and then he shut himself in the room and began day and night meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the sand is lying on the roof of the roof, basking in the sun, lazy like a kitten. She does not go to Richard, nor does she know when he will come out of the meditation room. Anyway, knowing that the guy is doing business, not doing Qi Qi, that is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines on her body, and the amber eyebrows seem to have a brilliance of brilliance, which is unspeakable and beautiful. The sand drifted over the book of time, lazy and said: "God, you said that Richard did not figure out what the kid is? What is his thoughts about the war now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her unintentional self-speaking, but she did not expect a paragraph in the book of Time to really say: "Don't avoid it, fight in battle."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands repeatedly look at these eight words, the mood is suddenly complicated, and there are gratification and loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After March, Richard finally stepped out of the meditation room. At this time, he was already a 16-level magician, and from Faro’s By standard, the title of the Magister is already available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only taking a short break for a long time, and then he plunged into the magic lab and worked day and night. In addition to the followers, Richard does not allow anyone to enter his magic lab, this time the drawing does not bother to score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month, it just quietly ran away. People only see a huge amount of magic material being sent to the magic laboratory, and Richard's warehouse is gradually empty, and all kinds of waste products are constantly being thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finally got out of the magic lab, the warehouse that was once full of materials had become empty. After seeing the sun for a month, Richard was thinner and his face became paler. The original trimmed short beard became a messy beard, and his work was too long, and his eyes were deeply trapped. However, in this way, the elegance of Richard's body belongs to the elf is more prominent. At this moment, he is like a decadent high vampire, elegant but extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the current feeling of Richard is extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha picked up his eyes and looked at the sun in the air, floating a faint smile. He has a box of magic in his hand, so he carries it so casually that he doesn't care. There should be nothing precious in it. There is really only one structure in the box, but the structure is a bit special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi came over at this moment and said, "Master, is your work done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and handed the box to the 珞Qi, said: "Retract this. Also remember to be prepared, I will return to Noland in the next few days. Yes, inform other people, come to me for a meeting in the evening. I have not seen them for a long time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master." Qi Qi held the box and turned away. However, she still had a little doubt in her heart. Looking at what Richard didn't care about, it seemed that the box inside the box was a very common one. However, Qi Qi may know more than anyone's horror attainment on the structure, and can let Richard bury his head and work hard for a month. How can it be ordinary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Qi Qi is holding an ordinary box of magic, and the way that Richard handed over is also very random. The box was not sealed, but Richard did not say that she would not open, no matter how curious. But if she really knows what is inside, she may be able to resist the temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the inside of the box is filled with life, it is a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked to the lab warehouse, Qi Qi suddenly remembered the details that almost ignored, that is, when Richard handed the box, the sleeves rolled up. The roll, on his forearms, reveals a few decorative patterns that were not available in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Qi Qi left, Richard walked into the dormitory that had not been back for a long time, and told the maid to put a full tank of hot water and lie in, comfortably I gave a sigh of relief, then I slammed my head and gave a slight squeak, and I fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand came in and quietly left. Qi Qi also walked in and put hot water on the bathtub. The gentle movement did not awaken the extremely tired Richard, and then she quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset, dusk, and then return to the earth at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing, and in the conference room, the followers of Richard are all in, everyone has different postures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has passed since the appointment, but no one is impatient. They are chatting casually in the north and south, guessing what kind of surprises Richard will bring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the people in the house, tiramisu is undoubtedly the focus of attention. There is no doubt about the potential of Tiramisu, and the two-headed ogres can't go to the sanctuary. And when he has more magical weapons like this, the strength can be described as a leap. It can be said that before the magic of Tiramisu was drained, the followers in the house had to be chased up and down like a rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the fighting priest Io, watching the ogre's eyes have unabashed shackles. He never puts the structure of Richard in his eyes, but that means the ordinary structure, such as the magical armor, the impact can completely kill anyone's psychological defense, including Iraq. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know anything at this time, just immersed himself in the deepest sleep. In the endless darkness, he felt that he was surrounded by the soft dark blue, unable to tell the safety and comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked into the conference room, the sky was bright. The followers of a house are still chatting, and many people are fighting with Tiramisu because they can't beat the ogre on the playground. When it comes to bickering, Tiramisu is not afraid. He is big enough and has two mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Richard came in, all the followers were quiet, and their eyes fell on Richard for a moment. However, first of all, the face of Iowa changed, and then other followers also changed. In the end, even the slowest sense of Sandro, who was supposed to be the slowest, moved his body subconsciously and was far from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the conference room instantly dropped to freezing point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his followers with amazement and did not understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Gangde spoke up: "That, head, you seem to have changed a bit. It has become a little scary, this feeling, how to say it, It’s like you are a dragon who has just become a human being. It’s dangerous to get too close. And your eyes are a bit wrong, as if you are always spinning around our key points and flaws.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, is that the case?" Richard glanced, then took a few deep breaths and slowly converges. This finally made the followers feel normal, but they still feel that there is occasional faint acupuncture feeling from Li Cha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s much better now." Gangde nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Richard sat directly at the conference table and said to the following group of followers who were not serious at all: "This time, Is there anything that needs to be dealt with?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunde is most familiar with the Faro situation, saying: “The interior of the Sequoia Kingdom is now empty, the three Dukes and the royal family Power has been hit hard, so there are some people who are eager to move. In addition, the Iron Triangle Empire has recently shown signs of interfering in the internal affairs of the Kingdom. Our people have recently had several conflicts at the border and the Iron Triangle Empire. It seems that they are testing us. "The real thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhangmei expressed a murderous murderousness, saying: "The gods are not gods, the aristocrats who attack the invaders are the gods. Are you allowed to invade their territory within one year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde shrugged: "This kind of thing, obviously won't fight, but secretly intervenes always Inevitably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "It seems that I have to find a time, and The triangle empire has another fight. They can't remember the lesson. But not now, wait for me to deal with Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Two things, the head, the heir to the Duke of the Wolf, Toffler, has not yet officially inherited the title of the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly remembered the wolf The Duke, silently, said: "What is the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still someone who wants to dismember the Duke of the Wolf, and the movement of the royal family is said to be quite big." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Okay, I know. What is your opinion on this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers are mostly silent, they are good at fighting, but not longer than politics. Finally, Io said: "The carpets leading to the throne are all stained with blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Just do what you say! Richard directly buckled the black pot on the head of the fighting priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there is nothing important. So Richard continued to let Gangde stay in Faro, and he took the water and sand, and the ten sold version of the magic ride, quietly returned to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
