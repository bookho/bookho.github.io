			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vague roar in the sky, the huge dragon of the five-color dragon accompanied by the anger, sent through the plane transmission channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard and others are super-existent, and no one will be overwhelmed by the dragon of the five-color dragon, not to mention her Longwei is still a crossover. The face was sent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star nebula chain is constantly ejected from the star sage's fingertips, constantly eradicating the five-color mask. The dragon force of the five-color dragon is continuously sent through the plane transmission channel, not only strengthening the five-color mask, but also continuously attacking the star sage across the void. The two sides struggled for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this battle, Richard roughly estimated the power gap between the five-color dragon and the star sage. The five-color dragon has crossed the plane to fight the Star Sage. Even so, the Star Sage has not been able to gain any advantage. From this point of comparison, it can be seen that the strength of the five-color dragon is far above the star sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Star Sage has already fought, Richard will not hesitate to take the passage to the plane. Before entering the plane of the plane, there was no wave of hand, and a light fell on Richard. The destruction projection has been blessed on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the destruction projection came, Richard was the first to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the destruction of projection and the king of war are very different. The king of war allowed Richard to clearly understand his level of improvement, but the destruction of the projection did not feel anything, and Richard did not upgrade, nor did he feel any other improvement. However, Richard has stepped into the transmission channel. He is based on trust in facelessness and confidence in his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard rushed into the transmission channel on the same day, he collided with the five-color dragon incarcerated at the other end of the channel. Now that Richard’s strength has improved, if he encounters a five-color dragon, he will not be beaten as badly as he did last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard walked out of the passage, he flew a huge fist without expecting a head-on. On the side of Li's head, he slightly deviated from the trajectory of the fist bombardment, and the left arm was up, then the right hand was out of the knife, and the backhand took a knife and went to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s left arm slammed into the heavy punches from the opposite side, and the entire space trembled in an instant, and then there appeared gray and black ripples! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard only felt that the opposite side was pressing over a mountain, and the enormous force made him squat all over the body. However, Richard hardened his teeth, but only retreated less than a metre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Richard is a tall and beautiful woman. She is nearly four meters tall, her face is full of arrogance, and a pair of amber erects reveals her non-human identity. In the long dark hair, five curved dragon horns are extended, which is a distinct feature of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he couldn’t punch Licha back into the plane of the plane, the five-color dragon was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Su Hailun can resist the force of her punch, the body of the dragon enslaver is an ancient and powerful star. But Richard is just a human race that is so fragile as a worm. How can it resist her? Even if the five-color dragon is transformed into a human figure, there is also the power of the abyss small lord level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how she can't figure it out, the moonlight of Elf's sorcerer in the hands of Richard has been silently stabbed. The five-color dragon turned into a woman who didn't care. However, Richard's moonlight spurred halfway through, and suddenly there was a square of tetrahedral shadows of different sizes on the blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-color dragon exclaimed, and then took a step back, and it was easy to let Richard’s blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this is a glimpse of Richard himself. As a result, the pursuit was slower and the five-color dragon returned to calm. Richard immediately rushed up, only listening to the muffled sound of the cymbal, and the ripples rippled from one person to the other. The volatility occasionally appeared several small tetrahedrons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These shocks and volatility contain the power of horrible rules. A dragon is slightly closer to being swept by the waves, and the whole dragon suddenly burst into a day. Blood rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dragons panicked, withdrew from the scope of the turbulent fluctuations, looking at the five-color dragon and Richard in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dragon plane, the five-color dragon is the existence of the supreme god, and all the dragons naturally think that Richard is no better than them. The gods are in the same breath. But the reality at hand is that Richard and the five-color dragon have been difficult to solve for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane transmission channel fluctuated again, and no face quietly emerged from the channel. She first looked at the situation around, and then strode to the other side of the five-color dragon, holding the sword handle, and the unsightly gaze was aimed at the five-color dragon's fart/strand position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so arrogant, how can the five-color dragon not feel it? This is a shame that cannot be forgiven. The five-color dragon immediately wants to kill the no-face. However, how can Richard give her this opportunity, naturally it is all the way to attack, so that she can not do anything to do anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the moonlight swayes, many regular tetrahedrons appear on the blade, and then gradually disappear. The five-color dragon seems to be a little afraid of the moonlight, constantly blasting a group of five-color light group, wanting to force Richard out. But Richard also unknowingly returned to the blue fire, although the blue fire is less powerful, but it is also able to resist the five-color light group. The battle suddenly fell into a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely at Richard, you are still in a downwind, just squatting on the strong body and superb combat skills, and there is a kind of unscrupulous no-face This will drag the battle into a stale state. Just use the gaze, no face to let the five-color dragon feel the extreme discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the deliberate guidance of Richard, although it was difficult, but the battle, the battlefield still gradually left the plane of transmission. At this moment, the channel suddenly lit up again, and it was decided to come out of the passage. She rarely held a quasi-artifact-level dagger and then strode to the five-color dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is getting faster and faster, and in the end it is a step to flash in front of the five-color dragon, a sword! The five-color dragon backhanded off the indefinite dagger, and the unrivalled strength brought her to fly back tens of meters. However, Richard attacked again and let the five-color dragon have to give up the pursuit of uncertainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space near the plane transmission channel is not enough to support this size of battle. So Richard, Wu Ding and Wu Selong were very tacitly raised to the sky, and then let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face is also flying to the sky, but she did not shoot, but constantly fine-tuned her posture, so that her eyes can always fall on the five-color dragon, Especially on her round buttocks. In contrast, the faceless harassment is more than the combination of Richard and the undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-color dragon was finally completely irritated by the faceless, but when she figured out how to shoot the reptile with a claw, the plane of the plane suddenly Another flash of lightning, the star sage Span walked out of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Span immediately became the last straw to overwhelm the camel. The five-color dragon light has done its best to deal with the two killings of Richard and Undecided, and it is no better than fighting against another real superpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the Star Sage, even if there is a dragon rule rule, the five-color dragon is not a four-person opponent. She was angry and long, and her body shape increased rapidly. In a blink of an eye, she became a dragon with a length of 100 meters, and it was still expanding. The sly five-color mask protects her body from top to bottom, leaving her conversion form undisturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the body shape continues to increase, the breath of the five-color dragon also skyrockets. Everyone has some discoloration. I have never thought that the five-color dragon will be strong enough to this point, and here is the dragon's plane. Under the suppression of the rule power, the power of the undecided and the sages is up to 80%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All four know that you must not let the five-color dragon fully show a complete posture, otherwise it is a hard fight. A god-class behemoth like the five-color dragon, with its strength, is already close to the level of the plane. It is purely dependent on the extremely huge body shape, which can bring endless troubles to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xing Xian immediately shot countless nebula chains, penetrated into the five-color mask, quickly cracked and consumed the power of the mask. However, whenever a mask is dim, a five-color light cluster will appear on the five-color dragon, and the mask will be repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stars are as heavy as water, and there are hundreds of stars in the chain, and they are still increasing. Some chain chain tips pass through the void and appear on the dragon's body of the five-color dragon, trying to entangle her. But now the dragon body of the five-color dragon has increased to more than 3,000 meters, and it still seems to grow without end, and a few nebula chains are simply comparable to the thin wire that breaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing also rushed up, her stiletto sword ignited a purple-grey chaotic flame, a sword pierced into a five-color mask, suddenly in the mask Make a huge wound on the top! Then he decided to flash into the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after entering the shield, it is impossible to find that the inside of the shield is full of fog-like five-color light! These hazes also have a protective effect, thick and thick, and it is extremely difficult to move inside, and it is always affected by many negative states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is the master of chaos rules, and naturally has a strong resistance to negative states. However, staying in this environment for a long time, more or less always contaminated with several negative states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the sage also tore a tear with the nebula chain, but it is much more difficult than nothing. He also rushed into the five-color mask, but he quickly snorted a few times, his body was black, and apparently had a negative state, and still a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
