The ice floe bay outside the window. He could hardly imagine that this sentence would be said by Richard. A 12-year-old child, a child who is silent, but hard, hardworking, and motivated, suddenly wants to learn to kill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sudden, every painting that Richard has painted appears in the mind of the master. Thinking of the lines that hide the infinite power, the master suddenly found himself wrong, and he always treated Li as an ordinary boy. In the education system of the human aristocrats, some 12-year-old children are already mature, and fifteen years old is a recognized adult standard. Outside the human active area, children of certain orc tribes are six or seven years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, the master sat up straight and asked seriously: "The person you want to find is my confirmation, he is the real killing expert. But I First of all, you need to know why you want to learn to kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the builder is the creator of war, then only by learning to kill can you create a better structure. Install the knight," Richard said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer of Richard once again made the master feel helpless. After a few deep breaths, he barely calmed down his depression and said slowly: "A good reason It sounds like real. But it doesn't matter, as long as there is a reason to be able to say it. That person is called Naa, but almost everyone called him 'the disaster blade' many years ago. You should be able to get from him. Get what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and corrected his attitude to the master, then handed over a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master thought it was another homework, but he didn’t expect it to be a payment certificate signed by Richard. It was confirmed that the master gave him a class hour this month. number. Of course, most of the class hours do not exist at all. But with this document, the master can pay the gold coins to the deep blue, and the number of gold coins out of thin air reaches 10,000, which is a number that he can't ignore. This process is also very safe, because the compensation for the individual lectures is ultimately paid by the students, and Deep Blue will liquidate the money to Richard. Since there is no damage to the deep blue finances, it will naturally not be traced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this payment credential, the master’s heart is again chaotic, is this a bribe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" The master stopped the little Richard who was about to leave, grabbed the messy hair and asked, "Why are you looking for me to help?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it feels the easiest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That if I don't want to help What about you? Who are you going to find?" The master is not dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Gold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master stunned, originally in the mind of Xiao Licha, engaged in art The same as playing gold coins is not reliable, so I chose the breakthrough here. However, he would like to know another answer, so he cried: "Hey! Little Richard, who are you going to find in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee said without thinking : "The few great mentors who only want to teach students!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Richard left the dark blue main tower and came to the edge area Within the annex building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of mages living in the main tower, and each mage needs at least twenty or thirty people to serve them directly or indirectly. Most of these people live in the fringe area, because the rent price of the dark blue main tower is not affordable to any magician below the tenth level, even if it is a small house that can only put a bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marginal zone is also divided into several different levels according to the distance from the main tower, and the closest to the dark blue circular zone is home to a large number of mages. Most of them are less than ten. They can't live in dark blue, but they can barely settle down in the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark cloak, Richard crossed several areas and reached the outermost edge of the fringe. Along the way, he felt a variety of eyes, from the arrogant eight-level wizard, to the dark little people's ill-conceived gaze, and more people were curious. Most people who wander in the same area all day long know each other, or at least familiar, strangers are naturally noticed. The logo of the third-level magician at the corner of Richard's cloak prevented him from a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of a dark, uninhabited alley, Richard stood in front of a run-down tavern. The wooden signboard of the pub cracked a big hole, and it was faintly seen that it was branded with a semi-naked woman, and the painting was vulgar. From the shack's door slits, there were a few dim lights, which were quiet, no shackles, no bands, and only a pungent wine came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s winter now, the cold is everywhere, and only the deep blue main tower keeps warm under the influence of magic, this warmth will radiate to the inner ring of the fringe area . This is one of the reasons for the high rents in the inner ring, and it is also the source of the heavy burden and arrogance of the inner ring residents. In this alley at the end of the fringe, the temperature is very cold. Even if the tavern of this size is turned on, it is only a little warmer than the outside. If you want to reach the temperature of the room, the pub is one month. The turnover cannot be used for one day's energy consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So warm, the difference in Richard’s senses is still quite big, but for most ordinary people, minus 30 degrees and 50 degrees In fact, there is not much difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this damn weather, and in such a remote location, there is certainly no guest in the tavern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and pushed the door of the pub and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is small in size and only has three tables. After the bar stood a medium-sized man with a plain face, and the half-white horns looked a bit old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table at the corner, the two raging men in clothes are sitting lazily against the wall, drinking a bite without a drink. The wine is very strong, but the taste is very pungent, presumably the price is quite cheap. The thing they drink is a thin dish of dried meat. I don't know what meat it is, but the dryness is completely dehydrated. People have no appetite when they look at it. However, the two men carefully and carefully picked up a piece of meat, put it in the mouth, chewed it down, and remembered the aftertaste, and then poured a few mouthfuls of bad wine. Just like a small dish, it seems that it can't be eaten all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the week and had already seen the pub. The man behind the bar cleaned the cup and glanced at Richard and said, "Little guy, did your mother tell you that you have to drink alcohol in adulthood? Of course, if you have money, I don't mind giving you down. Two cups."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened the hood of the cloak and said, "I am not drinking, I want to find someone."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for?" The man behind the bar seems to have some interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disaster blade." When the words were exported, Richard suddenly felt as if he had fallen into the ice cave, and he was frozen and stiff, and he could not move a finger. ! Except for the head, it seems that the whole body is not under your control. And the coldness of the attack came with all kinds of sharp thorns, like a thousand needles stabbing his skin. This is the first time that Richard has known the taste of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the light condenses at the same time, the two men at the table stop their movements. One keeps holding the wine glass and pours it into the mouth, and the other carefully cautiously rolls the thin, almost transparent flesh in the air. However, they obviously didn't even move a finger like Richard. Although the action was still, their eyes fell on Xiao Licha, and there was no extra expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man behind the bar stopped the action of wiping the glass, looking up at the faint yellow candle on the wall, apparently caught in some kind of memory. After a while, he came back to God and looked at Richard. He said: "The disaster blade is my former nickname. It has been a long time. I am now called Naia. You can know the disaster blade, then it is a friend, although I am very curious, a child who has not grown up is here to do what he wants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to learn to kill." Richard's words have always been concise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I feel, maybe I will need it soon "," Li said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya nodded and did not ask the reason, but said: "This is dark blue, even if it is only the outermost, it is also dark blue. So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have prepared my tuition," said Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya opened his mouth and smiled: "My course is expensive, at least five hundred gold coins a day."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice-stabbing killing disappeared with this laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took out a delicate enchanted leather purse bag, opened it, and dumped a bunch of shiny gold coins on the bar, saying: "I am preparing a thousand So, teach me everything you can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya looked at the piles of gold coins casually and smiled, saying: "One The child who hasn't grown up yet, with so much money, has gone to the old nest of a killer. Are you afraid that I will swallow you directly? I know that most of the guys who like to paint women introduce you, but that The guy is a cartilage head and can't believe it at all. So, little guy, now you come to give me a reason why I shouldn't kill you directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I It only brought today's gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya smiled more happily and said, "Smart children! But it is best to give me some other reasons. I sometimes do things for money, sometimes I don’t. So for the sake of insurance, it’s best not to guess if I want to point now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and said, "My name is Richard, Richard Akmon. My teacher is His Highness, Su Hailun, father." It’s Gordon Archimonde.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Naa’s face suddenly stagnate, and he rushed to the ground and vomited, rushing to the table. The two men on the side snorted: "You say it! Old man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
