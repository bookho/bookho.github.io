			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a group of elves gathered outside the village, divided into two parties, clearly defined, one side is The elves of the Yongye tribe, they are very easy to recognize, the simple and gorgeous robes are the most obvious signs, and the guardian elves are as simple as primitive people. On the other hand, the night elves are relatively Taller than the guardian elves, the face is also more majestic, but at the moment the two sides confront each other, but the people on the side of the Yongye tribe are shy and angry, glaring at the opposite guardian elves, but no one dares to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian elves have about a hundred names. From the color-coded emblems, most of them are warriors of the tribal tribes, and a few are the tribes of the three tribes. At this time, a slang elf who looks more special from the service color is walking back and forth in front of the Yongye tribe. He said loudly: "Merge is your only way out, and the only way to keep your tree of life." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young warrior of the Yongye tribe finally couldn’t help but shouted: "This can also be called a merger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The slang upper elf went to the young soldier and stared at his eyes, saying in a word: "I said that the merger is a merger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;砰 闷 闷 暮 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , He swept them and sneered: "You want to be desperate, can, come, don't want to be a tree of life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the Eternal Night Elf was immediately suppressed, and another Eternal Night Elf, who was old and dressed in a uniform, stood up at this moment. People said, "What are you doing, forget the Presbyterian order? It is strictly forbidden to provoke any provocative behavior before the elders of the elders and the tribal tribes talk about the results."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned around and said coldly to the young soldiers who were still struggling on the ground: "Now, as an alternate elder, I am free of your soldier’s identity, the next punishment, and other VIPs. Go and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Elf level, the warrior identity is the first step of the upper class, a large number of hunters, only less than half of them can have warriors Identity, that means privilege, but more means glory, the young warrior struggled to look up, almost unbelievably looking at the face of the alternate elder, but with a bang, his head was heavily stepped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who was in the night of the night was completely angry. Many people even pulled out the short sword at the waist. The alternate elder was shocked and immediately angered and shouted at them: "You are this What do you want to do, don't listen to my orders, immediately give it to me, go back to the tree house, right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternate elders are thunderous, forever Even though the night elves are glaring at the proverbs, they have to go back a little bit. The elves are a well-defined race, especially the higher elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang upper elf laughed, then kicked a few feet and kicked on the young warrior, and immediately kicked his mouth and nose and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lota." A Yongyue girl rushed out and threw herself on the young warrior, protecting him with her own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang upper elf looked at the girl with interest and seemed to be more satisfied. She actually asked the name, and the girl did not dare not answer, so she went up. The elf nodded, laughed and said nothing, let the girl lift the young warrior, and then whispered something in her ear, the girl immediately pale, glaring at the upper elf, the upper elf but laughing Pointing at the young warrior lying on the ground, the girl’s face was completely bloodless, and the stubbornness in her eyes gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper elf laughed and returned to his own heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, both Richard and Melin saw this scene. Richard turned to Ms. Melin and said, "There are a lot of talents in your tribe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin certainly knows that Richard is referring to the alternate elder, her face flashed with anger, but finally shook her head helplessly, sighed: "What is there? The way, is it really going to war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can talk to them or ask for support from the world tree," Richard suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin suddenly angered and yelled, "We are outsiders, they will not give us a chance to reason, the world tree is like this, it The most hated is the outsider. I am not talking to you for the first time. I don't want to repeat it for the third time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One temper is finished, Mei Lin Cai realized that her attitude was bad and sighed and said: "I'm sorry, I... I really feel bad. Let's go see the elders. Let her know about the Aoba tribe. Let me go with me. Good. Be a witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was indispensable, followed by Melin to the tree of life. In the eyes of Richard, the life tree of the Yongye tribe is different from other life. This is not only the difference in power attributes, but the rules represented. Some differences, even if they are only a few differences, are also big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an interest in this tree of life, silently using insight to analyze and remember its breath, while picking up the ranks and going to the top of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Yongye tribe live in a wooden house at the top of the tree. At the top of the tree of life, this wooden house with only a few hundred square meters is not The number of places occupied is not in line with the identity of the elders. Even the little tribes that Richard seized, the residences of the elders and the patriarchs are larger than this, if the grand elders receive the guests and the office are here. In the tree house, it can be called shabby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders’ living room is only tens of square meters, divided into inside and outside, and Richard and Melin come to the outside to see the sliding door between the inside and the outside. I don't know who was smashed, and there is no point in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the interior, on a gorgeous high-backed chair, sitting on an elf, she is a gorgeous robes in a typical high elf style, but with a headband With a hood, a metal mask on his face, and even his hands wearing woven silk gloves, the whole body can be said that an inch of skin is not exposed, and it is impossible to measure her appearance and age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gun frame on the wall behind her, with a four-meter-long gun placed on it, the rifle was blue-green, decorated with gold, and it was gorgeous. Only a long shot has taken up a third of the length. There is a four-blade blade on the front of the gun. The spiral is forward, until the tip of the gun is combined. This is the shape, it is from the master. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three guardian elves standing in the living room, two are the Yi language tribes, one is the wind language tribe, and the Dalai Luyi of the Yi language tribe is obviously It is the first of the three people, and is talking in front of the elders of the night. "The benefits of the merger are too many, and there is no need to say anything more. The noble elders of the night, and then delaying will only come to the Yongye tribe. The more unfavorable, now in addition to the three tribes of the wind language, two tribes have chosen to support our slang tribes, they will also participate in the merger plan, you see, why must we insist, if we have promised us long ago, Only the two tribes of proverbs and slang are merged. After the merger, you will still have the position of elders..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders suddenly said: "Merge, yes Breeding, just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big Druid face of the proverb became extremely ugly, and he snorted and said: "Even if it is breeding, this is a great opportunity to wash away the blood of the outsiders. The elders, I advise you. If we reject our proposal, you have to think about whether you can resist the coalition of our six tribes, and even the tree of life will be destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elders listened in silence and said faintly: "When you are finished, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Druid is furious and turns back to the side of the tribe The hunter gave a wink, and the hunter immediately pulled out the short sword and strode forward. He said, "You can't live without knowing how long you can live. You dare to scatter here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a 18th-level hunter. At this moment, his mouth is arrogant, but he has gathered his body and is very nervous. It’s no wonder that the Everlasting Elders After Lin Hai, no matter how bad the battle is, there is never a defeat. Although the hunter has the power of the sanctuary, but the eyes of the elders swept away, I feel Under a pot of ice water thrown, immediately re-cool to the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is behind the fire, it is the slogan of the Druid of the proverb, the wind hunter gnawed his teeth and said: "Please enlighten the elders. "The sword is all over the body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was suddenly a light in the room, dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders reached for a stroke, the rifle jumped into her hands, and the domineering sweep, the wind hunter directly flew, the sanctuary The hunter flew directly from Richard, knocked out the door, and then called to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was in a cold sweat, it was a hundred meters in the air, and the hunter couldn’t die even if he had the power of the sanctuary, but the big elder would only shoot. Sweeping, its momentum is like a wind, it can be called overbearing, and Richard is self-proclaimed with the sacred hunter, and only the dodge, never dare to pick up, of course, only flash can only flash To get rid of, the Sanctuary hunter is hiding and can't hide before being directly blasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind hunter was smashed, and the great Druid of the proverb was not only angry, but sniffed, but a hint of joy, he stared at the elder He said in a gloomy manner: "The elders, it seems that your injury is really not light. Now it can’t be suppressed. The Yongye tribe does not have a strong person like you. I want to see if you have any means to resist us. The coalition of the six tribes, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
