			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, Odom’s sight finally appeared in Richard’s force. The temporary camp was obviously just built, and the campfire did not have time to ignite. Since the two teams have approached this distance, the other party has apparently discovered their whereabouts. Therefore, at this time, Richard’s troops occupied the only small highland next to the camp and were making the final whole team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing Richard’s accidentally rigorous military and the exceptionally good equipment of his soldiers, Odom’s eyes could not help but twitch. Although he is arrogant, he is not a arrogant person, and naturally understands what it means to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This embarrassment is much harder than what he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of Little Heights, Richard looked at Odom’s army opposite, and did not feel surprised. “I’m not saying dusk castle and two of the deer’s count. Thousands of troops, how come only seven hundred?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark carefully observed the composition of the opposing troops and said: "The leader is Sir Odom, he But the sanctuary is strong. Well, it seems that he brought all the cavalry out, there are two big priests and two great magicians in the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are several huge bats flying in the sky. It’s a bit strange to see the bats during the day, but now Odom’s attention is on the opposite enemy, not paying attention to the goshawk or something else flying overhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time an elite bat has seen the followers of the old Hogan. Although marching all the way, the battlefield is still more than 30 kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of Richard is a bit weird, saying: "I want to eat me with this cavalry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark has never seen the battle of Richard’s command, but he is very familiar with the fighting power of the aristocratic army of the human king. He judged the strength of both sides in his heart and looked solemn and said: I’m afraid that this war is not optimistic.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like a smile and says, “You look at it.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Richard pointed to Odom, then flipped his hand down and made a cut throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perception of the Sanctuary is very powerful, thousands of miles apart, Odom has seen Richard’s provocative action, immediately from the thick nostrils Two white air spurts, and the bones of the whole body creak. The horses of his majesty felt the wrath of the master, and began to be restless, constantly starting to dig with the iron hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom took off the huge three-headed hammer hanging from the side of the saddle and lifted it high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-parent iron riders, one hundred elite heavy rides, three hundred eagle flag knights, and three hundred light rides in order to form a good formation. The horses began to scream with uneasiness, and the knights clenched their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Odom took a sigh from the chest: "kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Odom's black figure is like the wind, and the ride is first rushed out. A team of knights move in turn, rushing to the opposite enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is already shaking slightly, and seeing the momentum of hundreds of iron rides on the face, even Clark has changed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior's Guns are indeed elite, but as Odom judges, on the frontal battlefield, they are by no means the opponents of the regular Knights. Clark is wise and experienced, and is very clear about this. The power of heavy riding is almost impossible to crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard actually has a lingering confirmation: "Is Odom really 16? The distance is a bit far, my detective The test can't be put out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really a sanctuary!" Clark particularly emphasized the word sanctuary. On the other side of Richard, the highest level is only thirteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a sanctuary," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the staff of the "Fate Twins" and turned to Clark and said, "Don't forget to bless the war with Gangde."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading the steel torrent of the Knights Huicheng rolling in, when the battle of Richard's battle is about 100 meters, they have flattened the rifle and started to attack at full speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s array suddenly sounded a loud voice, full of killing, gold and iron! This is the song of the new society after Oral was promoted to the 11th level, and the effect is better than the Elf Wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian warriors standing in the first row are full of blood, screaming in the sky, forcefully insert the heavy shield into the ground, and then use the shoulders to resist. The barbarian warriors in the back row put the steel bracket on the ground and the other on the heavy shield. This doubles their ability to withstand shocks. The barbarian warriors in the back row put the rifle on the shield and pointed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human first-level warrior in the rear clenched the tomahawk and stood up. They are born fighting units and never know what is fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian with a bright smile like a sun, walking slowly, the language of the mouth is as magnificent as the hymn, the golden staff in the hand Every time you wave, you will sprinkle a large piece of sunshine, each piece of glory, enough to cover thirty or forty soldiers. In a blink of an eye, hundreds of soldiers in the front four rows were blessed with three effects: firm will, extraordinary strength, and sacred armor, and the combat power soared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first battle of the eternal battle hall of the eternal dragon hall, that glory, the calm, the momentum, let the old god of the Faro, Clark, also look I have to be dumbfounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard feels that the more he looks at this kid, the less pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still 50 meters away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom in the charge feels like a The heart is gradually sinking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war songs and the wide range of magical effects, each of which makes his heart tremble. Compared with the opposite officer, Odom feels that the two great priests behind him are completely idiots. They spent a long time, just to support their escorts, and only have one effect. Odom now has three magical effects, but in contrast, it is only comparable to the opposite barbarian warrior. There are at least hundreds of barbarians on the opposite side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thirty meters...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odom suddenly felt that the earth's shaking was abnormal! The lingering light in his eyes suddenly caught a batch of heavyweight fighters pouring out from the woods next to them! Only from the speed at which they rushed out, they know that at least the nine-level fighters, and the strength of the captains are only one line, completely elite. But this kind of elite, comparable to the Eagle Knight, how many hundreds, and only infantry? Even if it is a heavy infantry! Which commander is extravagant to turn them into infantry? What kind of idiots can this do to do this kind of thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odom feels that his anger is unstoppable. In addition to the brutal and reckless, he actually has a set of leading battles, regardless of the commander or personal strength, they all beat Old Hogan. Therefore, only a sweep of the soldiers from the woods, I felt instinctively distressed. Fortunately, the equipment of these soldiers is still excellent, which is quite true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the next moment, Odom feels wrong, a strong sense of crisis floats from the bottom of my heart, and it is irresistible in an instant! These elite warriors are obviously copying their own roads, and the two-wing light cavalry can't stop them! If they are shocked by them, it is definitely a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the extreme danger of danger, Odom’s roots are erected, he lifts the three-headed hammer of the spin, and roars with all his strength. : "Crushing over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only rushing through and smashing Richard's formation will make a living! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, a strong lightning suddenly fell from the sky, slamming on Odom! Despite the protection of the magical effect of the body, the power of this lightning is strong, and it is incredible! Odom was almost exhausted in an instant, but it was still all over the body, and most of the hair was turned into smoke, and there was a dizziness in his head, almost immediately planted from the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise of the war horse, the destiny of the hands of the twins are lifted up, the fallen angels are like the electric light, the whole body is strong until a few blind desires are received. Show the legendary staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a sixth-level lightning, with the addition of the fate of the twins, almost immediately took the unguarded Odom from the battle. And there were a few tiny lightnings coming out of the way, and Odom was smashed to the nearest few guards. This lightning not only reached the power of seven levels of magic, but also a bit of chain lightning power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided that he should be the protagonist on the battlefield. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instigated the horse, running back and forth, the destiny of the hands of the twins constantly waved, the lightning from the sky, the bombardment in the team of Odom, the power is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although Odom was full of blackness, he gnawed his teeth over the last ten meters, and did not fall from the war! Moreover, his extended temperament even protected his nearest few guards. The momentum of the sanctuary is manifested at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was so sinking that he couldn’t press Odom’s limelight when he failed to shoot down Odom. This battle priest is really too radiant. However, Richard has already used the hot blood ability. If he wants to go further, he will only rely on the boiling of the sand. But using boiling in this situation is by no means a wise choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he had lost his calmness. The magic that was most suitable was not the bombardment of lightning, but the natural summoning. The violent bear that suddenly appears in the heavy riding storm formation will definitely confuse the opponent's rigorous formation. Losing the formation means that the cavalry is at least one-third less lethal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
