			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulators, as well as the prisoners in the village, stopped their movements and slowly Standing up, staring at Richard and others, he kept saying: "You killed the baby... you killed the baby..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face passed a layer of shadow, showing murder for the first time. Five sparks floated on his fingertips, flew down to the ground in front of him, burning like a candle, and stopped before the prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go." Li turned and walked outside the village, never looking back, a prisoner continued to follow the pace of the chase The foot accidentally stepped on a small fire of a large bean. However, this little flame turned into a skyfire column in the blink of an eye, engulfing him all the whole. The prisoner struggled with pain, but was still taken in a short time. The flame of purgatory breath is ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners have stopped suddenly, and the invisible boundaries of the other four small flames are clearly the demarcation of survival and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the way to leaving the village, Richard suddenly said to Io: "I found that the power of God seems to be more suitable for creating pain than the dark forces."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat priest said in an understatement: "That is inevitable. It is not stronger than the devil in the field where the devil is good at it. What do the gods compete for from the devil?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sky in the black valley suddenly surged, revealing a huge fuzzy face, its voice rolling down, there is a thunder: "I just felt it. What, it is from the destruction and chaos of the abyss, it seems that I have a distinguished guest, you come to the painful hall in the center of Black Valley, I will welcome you there."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end, the huge face on the cloud gradually dissipated, and Richard looked up at the sky and suddenly smiled and said, "Let's play with ghosts, ignore it, let's go to Bruno first."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel has some incomprehensible questions: "The guy just now is this The biggest secret of the valley, is Bruno even more important than it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious smile of Richard said: "From a rule level, yes. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant looked at him and looked at Richard, who had moved forward, and whispered to himself: "The level of the rules, the level of the rules, oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dissatisfaction of Iraq and Russia is justified. The rule of planes is the ultimate level of all power. Only when it enters the legendary realm, the power will be strong enough to break through the restrictions of the ** and begin to contact the rules. In addition, only in certain Special moments, such as the tree of life, are likely to have limited access to certain rules, and contact does not mean understanding and mastery. The complexity of rules far exceeds the imagination of ordinary people, just like Io and Nai. The special existence of You is also able to steal a piece of regular power with the memory of the soul that he has retained. It shows that it is far more terrible than the average priest, but they are also bound by the body in this world. It is impossible to be at this level. Then go to parse and master the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the famous saying of Charles the Great said: "The rules are like a beautiful girl, you must have the ability to find her, then you will find that It’s another thing to get her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard’s sentence is more like bragging and confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Naiyou gently pulled the robes of the fighting priests and said in a voice that only he could hear: "There is no need for Li to lie with us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not necessary..." The fighting sergeant said absently, then suddenly consciously said, "What do you say, what Richard said is true." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just think that he doesn't have to lie." Naiyou stressed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat sergeant looked suspiciously and asked: "Why do I think that compared with you, I am like a fool, but it was not like this before." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿..." Nai smiled and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno’s residence in a small village closest to the Pain Hall, asked the “lunatic” Bruno, where the prisoners immediately pointed to a log cabin by the village. The house is very simple, but it is made of real and practical wood. It is contrasted with other stone houses built by black rough in the village. In this village, the prisoners are doing the same thing in other villages. Most of them are in the house. Strive to create 'Holy Baby'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked to the front of the wooden house, he knocked on the door and heard an old voice from the door: "Please come in. It seems that there are rare guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He pushed the door and saw that the furnishings in the wooden house were very simple. There was only one bed, one table and one chair. When five people came in, they all turned away and placed on the table. There is a black painful brick, but this brick is obviously used as paper here, and the pen is a hard-burning mud strip that can leave traces. The bricks are filled with numbers and gods, Richard When I came closer, I immediately knew that the old man was calculating some sort of rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is clearly on a very correct path: discovering rules, establishing systems, parsing calculation rules, and then mastering and applying, just by Richard The experience, the old man calculated the rules in such a primitive way, I am afraid to calculate a million days, but also want to calculate a little rule on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still a simple rule, such as the rules displayed by the Nest, even if Richard’s wisdom talent has been promoted to the fourth order, it still needs 500,000 days. In order to be fully resolved, Richard’s speed of parsing the rules at this time is sixteen times that of his unwieldy talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno is an old man, but his body is still strong, his eyes are clear and clear, and there is a bit of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not crazy." Io asked what he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno smiled and said, "That is what you think, in the eyes of other prisoners, because I am too different from them, naturally I think I am crazy." Bruno took a deep look at Richard and said, "You can come here, it is incredible, even if it is a strong country." Stay here for a long time, otherwise it will become like the people outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Isn't it the smell of darkness and prison fire?" This may make others become lost and crazy, but it is not a problem for us, but it is really surprising that you can live here safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That is because of the help of a friend, I was able to free myself from the heavy punishment, study something, you come from afar, and find me, there must be an idea."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li said: "I just wanted to come in and see, but at the entrance to Black Valley, I met an elder named Ptolemy. He asked me to come to you and said that our views are very similar. I heard that you wrote A book, I don't know if I can take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to see my book." Bruno especially emphasized the word book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno did not answer yes or no, but to the window One finger, ask: "Things here, how do you feel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to comment: "This is the deepest evil, than the devil. To go one step further, it ignores the rules, not playing with the soul, but creating and re-extracting the soul, which is the great lord of the painful hell, and will not be more excessive than what I have seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruno’s face flashed with shock and said: “You are in the realm of courage, are you not afraid of punishment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked proudly and said: "I haven’t played with Nei. The result of the last war was that Nei has lost the parish of the Sequoia Kingdom to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have a very powerful god behind you, and you are very ambitious, and your ambition is so big that I feel shudder, so, this book You can take it, but do not underestimate the Internal Security divine punishment, especially in this land. "Bruno said meaningfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the sly hall outside the window, thoughtfully: "You mean the painful temple."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, all the evils in this valley will eventually gather there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, there should be somewhere A very powerful, very evil thing," said Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't name his name here, but when you see him, you will understand, since you entered the black valley, then I will definitely see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "He looks very impatient. Now he has sent his minions."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
