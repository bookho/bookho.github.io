			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechao Huo stood up and his face became awkward. In the corner of the arena, a soldier in leather is taking out a second spear and preparing to attack again. However, two sacred radiances flashed through the battlefield, falling on the stepping knights, one is a powerful treatment, and the other is a divine protection with a similar effect to the magic shield. After the two sacred lights flashed, the knights of the battle knights shone with magical brilliance and attacked the defense remotely. This is the masterpiece of Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three consecutive lights immediately shocked the entire arena! All high-ranking warriors understand what this means. It is a mage and a priest! And by looking at the two sacred radiances that are almost negligible, the priest is at least a priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Faro plane, a priest, even a 12-level priest, has a number of times in society and in battle. Fourteen thunder hammers. And a peer of the same level is even higher than the status of a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacker was also scared and stunned, and then remembered that the previous blow was not fatal. After being treated with a strong treatment in a timely manner, if you have a good rest, you may not even be affected by the fighting power. He raised his arm and prepared to throw a spear again, but just a little hesitation has made him lose his chance forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce whistling sound in the gladiatorial field. When Gangde waved his hand, his big axe whizzed away, and the screaming scalp numb The tearing sound has cut the attacker into two pieces! Three spectators were also killed in the reach of the axe. The giant axe finally broke into the rock-built stands, and the entire axe blade did not enter the rock, which stopped, and the axe handle was still shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned to look at Hoven and asked, "Who is the person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huo text also wanted to delay in accordance with the habit, but when he saw Richard's charming smile, he suddenly seemed to be poured a cold water and almost jumped out of his chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mark's!" Hoven answered with the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and waved a fireball out of the box, pointing to the box where Mark was. For a time, the entire arena is a mess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, run, fireball! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a semi-enclosed space, the power of fireball will increase accordingly, although it is not a big threat to senior fighters, but it is fatal to ordinary people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fire map, the bloody mark’s face is already distorted, and then the raging fire wave engulfs him, then fills every gap in the box, and There was a lot of flames coming out. Only a sigh of mark was heard in the box, and then a bang, the rear wall broke open a large hole straight through, and then the front half of the stand fell off the wall, crashing into the chaotic crowd below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and sat down slowly and said, "Running is fast enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gangde has jumped into the arena with two stepping knights, lifted the injured companion, jumped back to the box where Richard was, and immediately began to deal with the injury. It was shocked by two magicians and one priest, and no one in the gladiator guards dared to come forward to interfere with Gangde’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom layer has become a mess, people push me to compete and rush to the exit, exclamation and intertwined. The second floor stands are very quiet. Except for Mark's people who ran clean, Hu Li, Karon and Hoven were sitting quietly, staring at Richard, but their eyes were quietly a little more. Uneasy and frightened. The power shown by Richard is not all, but it has made them feel heavy pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the white square scarf and began to wipe his hand. It seemed to wipe the ashes from the fireball. In fact, fireball is a flame produced by magical power, and there is no ash at all. Seeing the move of Richard, the leaders of the three forces in the Bloodstone Camp have slightly changed their faces. This is one of the strategies that Liusha teaches to Richard. Through the iconic actions, the impression in the other's mind can be greatly enhanced, and the other party's mood at the moment can be informed through implied means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While cleaning up his hand, Richard seemed to carelessly said: "Mr. Hoven, you are smart, and I like smart people. Maybe we can do it in the future. Try to cooperate on some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very looking forward!" said Hoven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dwarf hosted by the gladiatorial rushed into the box of Richard, and opened the door, just swearing, "You smashed the box of the arena! "The next half of the sentence was blocked by the ten gold coins that Richard had thrown over." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the gold coins were in the hands of the hands, the dwarf slammed his eyes, repeatedly counted the number of gold coins twice, and then carefully said: "Adult, two guards are still dead. They are the most elite, brave, most loyal and most handsome half-orc warriors in the Bloodstone tribe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With a bang, Richard threw twenty gold coins and asked faintly: "Is it enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough! Too More!" The dwarf said as he continued the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair of Richard turned for a week and turned to face the dwarf and said, "Yes, enough! Then in your arena, The bloody mark of the sneak attack on my warrior, how to calculate this account?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf was shocked, his eyes turned a few times quickly, with a smile saying: "Look, this is a lot of people in this arena because of your reasons. My suggestion is that I can count it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't lift it, say faintly: "Forget it? Do you mean that my most elite fighters are worth a little bit of waste with these fighting powers? It seems that this is not the case in the Bloodstone tribe! And, bloodstone The rules of the arena are that the defeated party can sneak the winners at random? Is this the reputation of the half-orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf was surprised, did not expect Richard to touch the blood The value rules are so understood, and the last sentence is more meaningful, so I smile more flatterly: "You are really wise. Those ordinary people However, you can't resist your loss, but you can get the goodwill of the Bloodstone tribe. In the eyes of the villain, this is far more important than a few gold coins. As for the despicable guys, they should be condemned and punished. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the wounded knight’s injury has been dealt with, Richard stood up and said, "Call... well, then I believe bloodstone." The goodwill of the tribe, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard went completely, Hoven, Karon and Huli looked at each other and exchanged something with their eyes. Then leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
