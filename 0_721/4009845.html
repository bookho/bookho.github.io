			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the map and added a small one in one hand Mark, that is the point where he inferred another wave of intruders. Although I don't know the origin of the other party, it is definitely not a friendly army. In the plane war, joining forces with outside plane explorers is actually more dangerous than an alliance with indigenous people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard deduced a few lines, he could not help but hesitate. The forward base must be abandoned. The location here has already been exposed. Once it is encircled, there is a danger of the whole army being wiped out. Going back here is just to pack things up and to delay the time by misleading the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is hesitant about whether or not to stay in the Baron’s territory for a while. After a few battles, Richard has completely ruined the Baron Fossa. As long as he can give the prisoner of the Earl of Galleon a head-on attack, then the Baron’s territory will be like a portal, and he can let himself ask for it. At that time, a castle couldn’t stop Richard and his men like a wolf. But there is still a risk in doing this, because for guerrilla warfare, the most taboo is to stay in one place for too long, and to be aware of the strength and behavior. In the end, Richard is only an outsider. Although there is a higher-order power system and culture supported by Noland, it cannot reverse the fact that he is isolated and helpless in this position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the current action is the reinforcements of the Baron of Fossa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also produced a piece of information. The above is a very detailed map of the powers of the White Rock Principality. Under the Baiyan Grand Duke, there is also a Marquis, III. Grand Count, two ordinary counts, more than a dozen Viscounts, more than fifty barons. From the geographical and subordinate perspectives, Galleon, one of the three counts, is the most likely candidate to send reinforcements. In the name of the Earl of Galleon, there is a viscount, four barons, a jazz general, and the names of two great magicians. When she saw the name and introduction of Pelisa Gold, Richard’s pupils shrank slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Pelisa Gold and Sir Mintel are similar in character, that is, they are strong individuals and can lead the war. It is said that he is still one of the famous generals of the White Rock Principality. If the Earl's reinforcements are led by this person, then it is undoubtedly a delusion to give them a head-on blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard has no absolute strength, even if he does not consider the level of the ordinary warrior, relying on the existing core strength in his hand, with Pelisa Gold and its If there is bound to be a direct confrontation with the Guards, I am afraid that they will only be victorious. It is impossible to die. Unless you can grab the opportunity of differentiation and hit the battlefield as well as the terrain, the possibility is too embarrassing. The strength of the reinforcements brought by Pelisaquin is certainly far above the Baron of Fossa. That is to say, Richard’s overall strength is not only disparate, but also has no advantage in high-end combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a long breath and finally dismissed the idea of ​​looting the Baron Castle of Fossa, although the wealth of attraction accumulated in the Baron Castle for many years can be said to be best of all. But no matter how it is deduced, he has almost no chance of winning in the face of the Piaget reinforcements. If Panisakin is leading, there is no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he picked up the map again and began to study the route of the westbound northward. The finger sketched a curved line on the map and went all the way northwest. Along the turbulent land and the junction of the Duke of the Wolf, heading north to the Sequoia Kingdom, where the Duke of the Wolf, belongs, will enter a desolate and turbulent land: a place of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is the zone where humans meet the barbarians and the sand people. The land is rich and barren, the terrain is complex and diverse, but it is rarely stable. Food is produced. That place is a paradise for criminals, thieves and murderers, and a nightmare for ordinary people. Numerous wicked thieves and slave traders are entrenched in this land, like the hyenas on the highlands, treating all living creatures as their prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chaotic and blood-stained land is just right for Richard to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Baron Fossa, the seeds have been planted, waiting for the opportunity to harvest, and the harvest may not be too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not know at this time, just on the extension of the route he planned, there had just been a very intense battle. The place went to another intruder that he marked, and there was a distance not too close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-six kilometers north of the blood-stained land, is standing on an unusually tall portal. The portal is erected on the ground, and the door continues to appear along the various bands of light, flashing, and then annihilated. Even the gravity has been disordered, and many gravel clods have lost their gravity and are randomly floating in the air. But some other gravel is firmly nailed to the ground, even deeper and deeper in the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is constantly flashing through all kinds of blurred scenes, and some beasts are passing by. When they suddenly distort and disappear, they will find that these are just phantoms. The portal is too large, so that the surrounding space is beginning to show signs of twisting and turbulence. From time to time, some dark stripes drift over. It is an extremely dangerous space crack, and they are hit by them. It is the stronghold of Noland. Will be blocked by the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal is constantly telescopic, and one after another, the reloaded knight wearing a black armor jumps out of it. They are very tall and tall, and they look very awkward. The horses underneath are also very strange. The whole body is dark black, thick and thick, and there are two long fangs that extend out into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not calm around the portal, but full of killing and shouting, it is a fierce battlefield, a group of well-equipped native warriors and shrine knights The portal area has been completely surrounded, and it is struggling to strike the edge of the world that the black armor knights have broken into. Behind the soldiers, a full ten priests and pastors are constantly singing the spells, hands entwined with the eye-catching light, and blessing one by one to the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors who have blessed the gods are obviously high in ranks. They scream and roar, and the voices of praise and cursing the enemy are equally loud. Even if the enemy's double-edged sword penetrates into the body, you can even feel the serrations on the blade cutting the viscera coldly. These fighters will also scream and throw their weapons to each other, as long as they add a little to the enemy. Hurts are worthwhile in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The braveness of the fearless death and the huge advantage in the number of people did produce an effect. The eccentric black knights from the portal were one by one. Pull down the war horse and then be drowned by a large number of fighters. However, whenever a black knight is killed, he will fall more than ten times more soldiers around him. The knights who are fangs are also extremely fierce. Even if they lose their masters, they will still rush on the battlefield if they have not been completely cut down. The four hooves and the sharp teeth are their deadly weapons. And an unarmed war horse bite off a warrior half a head in one bite, and actually sticks out the thorny tongue and begins to eat his brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of terror frightened a few timid warriors, but completely angered most of the fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shrine knight screamed and slammed into the side of the war horse, piercing its heart with a sabre. The dark black fur of the horse is extremely tough, and it is comparable to the defense of the devil bear. However, under the full blow of the Knights of the Temple, the fur can not completely protect the vitality. The war horse screamed, and the voice was similar to the howling of Warcraft. Just in this space, there are more than a dozen pieces of various weapons stabbed on its body, most of them only penetrated a dozen centimeters to exhaust, but also a few pieces deep into the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
