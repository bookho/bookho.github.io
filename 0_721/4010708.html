			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his left hand and thousands of squadrons came out These imperial warriors formed a shock formation before they began to rush and charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the empire." I don’t know which empire veteran took the lead, and then all the empire veterans were mad: "For the empire," /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron knight is like a black sea wave rising from the tsunami, screaming with a suffocating sound, and the empire veterans burst out with amazing power, actually living After a long wave of waves, the huge waves immediately rushed over and drowned them. The iron hoof of the Knights of the Frontiers stepped over and no one stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was able to move his brain and turned to the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earth, the magic rides received the command of the thinker, which enabled the blood, when they started, their speed, explosiveness and durability. Will be greatly enhanced, the cost is to shorten the life of half a year, the Cavaliers torrent suddenly accelerated, to the speed when the charge, only to the far away Li Shilong map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu only slowed down for less than ten minutes, suddenly waking up, Richard did not split up to chase, can be said to be unable to catch up with all cavalry and maneuver The Emperor of the Corps, but another possibility is that Richard has full confidence to catch up with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu’s intuition is more inclined to the latter, so he immediately ordered the full speed to advance to the ice fortress, but sent a commander to the assembly area to let the army there The ice and ice fortress is close, this order is actually very sinister, and Li Shilongtu has turned the collapsed soldiers of the assembly area into abandoned ones, hoping to block Richard for a moment and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the way, the ice fortress has been looming on the horizon, the Imperial generals have just made a long breath, and suddenly they feel that the earth is starting to tremble abnormally, they Unconsciously looking back, I saw a row of black lines on the southern horizon, just like the prelude of the storm, rolling in and seeing the speed of these cavalry galloping, more than one general screamed: "How are they? It will be so fast,""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is also in the throat of Li Shilongtu, almost rushing out, because the speed of Richard’s pursuit has exceeded that of the Imperial Cavalry. speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gap between Noland and Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ice fortress is in sight, but in the end, the imperial army is no longer able to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magnificent cavalry showdown, more than 40,000 knights of all kinds were smothered on the land of the North, and Richard once again showed his delicate command of the battle. The imperial cavalry commanded like a slow-paced infantry, and the imperial cavalry looked very tenacious, but the actual results were pitiful, that is, the humanoid knight could also deal with three or four imperial cavalry with one strength. Those who are not good at fighting right away are not enough to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard defeated the Imperial Mobile Corps without suspense, and forced Li Shilongtu to make a very painful decision, that is, to drop his own corps and lead The guards first evacuated, and it was hard to hear, that is, escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of the empire expressed their understanding of Li Shilongtu’s decision. A living Li Shilongtu is definitely more meaningful than the death of the war here, so the war has just begun. When the strong and weak balance began to tilt significantly, Li Shilongtu led more than a thousand soldiers to bypass the ice fortress and headed for the Imperial Capital only a few tens of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was not in a hurry, but stayed to command the fifteen-minute battle until the imperial cavalry’s defeat was completed, and this instigated the brain. In the direction of Li Shilongtu's escape, he flew away. At the same time, the four hundred knights left the brigade and closely followed Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is very cold and very hard. On the horseback of the fierce bumps, Li Shilongtu only feels that the head-on wind is hitting the face like a sharp chisel. It hurts, he doesn't even remember when it was the last time he was chased, but now he has a strange feeling of shame, and some are just cold, a desperate cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decade ago, the voice of Salenwell seemed to be ringing in his ear. He advocated the power of the country to put the country where there was no blood. Richard was completely wiped out. At that time, due to political needs, Li Shilongtu became the strongest and most powerful tongue of the opposition. He also succeeded in driving Sharonwei away from the empire’s right center. At that time, it meant the Saarway. Seoul cut off the hope of inheriting the throne, but now recall that the only arsenal in the entire empire was the true vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the battle outside the Mouth of the Mountain, Li Shilongtu won the Saranwell again, but he lost to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the thought of this, Li Shilongtu’s heart was as painful as a thorn. He felt that the wind had become colder, and the running horses had become more bumpy. Fortunately, the outline of the Emperor was already far away. At this moment, a team of knights flew at an incredible speed, obliquely inserted between Li Shilongtu and the Imperial Capital, blocking the retreat of the legendary Marshal of the Empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the bursts suddenly fell from the sky, the shape of the horrible brain slowly descended, falling between the knights of the deep red duchy, the imperial side The horses were stimulated by the brains, and they were all standing up. Li Shilongtu had been sleeping all day and night, running continuously and escaping to the present. He was exhausted, and his hands and feet were stiff. He fell straight from the battle and was planted on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood on the brain and silently looked at the imperial marshal who struggled on the cold land. Li Shilongtu’s helmet had disappeared and was white. Long hair and beards appear to be messy and sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal, under the help of the guardian, struggled to stand up and coughed for a while, and the coughing blood was stained with red armor on his chest. Breathing a little, looking up at Richard, a bitter smile, asked: "Licha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu pushed away the support of the guards and approached Richard. He looked at Richard’s unchanging face and sighed: "It’s so young, you and your teacher, both. It’s not the people in our world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really.” Richard did not mind letting him approach a dangerous distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu sighed: "This fact is even seen by all of us, but I don't understand why our gods have not responded, even the three goddesses. Still standing on your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said: "That is because my teacher once fought with the gods here, the gods that can react They were all slept by the teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu suddenly widened his eyes. After a while, he recovered and sighed and said: "No wonder, It is no wonder that many gods suddenly become weak, or they are directly asleep. The three goddesses should be afraid of the power of your teacher, fear of corruption, and finally stand on your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked back at the direction of the emperor and said faintly: "Li Shilongtu, although I bring fewer people, but it is enough to destroy you. Only one charge is enough. You should not count on the army of the emperor. Save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilong figure smiled and said: "I have indeed had some extravagance, but just a little bit, come on, I am old. However, you can still swing the sword and fight like a warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilong figure pulls out the sword and puts the emperor with swordsmanship The posture, this swordsman has followed him for decades, and has already reached the realm of perfection. At this moment, the sword is swaying, and naturally there is a smothering of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his left hand and pointed forward, and hundreds of knights rushed out from him, killing Li Shilongtu and his guards in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A generation of imperial empire, this is the end of the battle, this is the only defeat in Li Shilongtu’s life, and the last defeat, Li Shilongtu is solemn and solemn, and has Richard The cold-blooded and ruthless that neither is with Allen, and the most difficult enemy to be defeated on the battlefield. If it is equal, Richard is not his opponent, and Allen is also losing. It is a pity that Richard, who has a mother's nest and is backed by Noland, has an overwhelming advantage on the battlefield. Li Shilongtu is the possession of the military gods of the past, and there is no room for change. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal fell to the ground half-finished, and there was a fist-sized blood stain on his chest that was still expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scar on the chest of the marshal is very familiar. This is the point of the gun that is shot on the breastplate, and then the violent explosion of the gun’s front penetrates. Armor and body, smashing the heart inside, this is one of the favorite moves of the knight, specially designed to deal with the opponents of the general strength, you can kill many enemies in an instant, then use the rifle to sweep the fly, clear out path of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shilongtu may be the whole iron triangle empire of Megatron, and even the famous western mainland, but in the eyes of Richard’s costume knight, he is just a fighting force. Ignore the ordinary old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal has a last-line life, his chest is ups and downs, his eyes are looking at the dim sky, his lips are arrogant, and the last slogan is spit out: "For... Empire..." Then, I fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
