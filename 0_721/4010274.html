			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shocking news is that Richard actually recruited candidates The construction of the knight, this can only show that the construction of Richard has more than the number of candidate knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the floating giants were busy digesting the two news, the portal of the Eternal Dragon Hall finally got a movement, and Richard came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that when the news was known, the old Duke of Joseph almost passed out on the spot. One of the Dukes, the two marquis, and the four counts of the Holy Alliance were very irritable that night, and some killed people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Noland, Richard immediately announced that he would hold a small assembly conference two days later. Due to time constraints, it is only for the floating world. Aristocratic giants. At the same time, the participants will be randomly selected to present five costume knights from Faro. As for the delivery of the major giants, the content description is extremely simple, indicating that there will only be a third-order configuration release, and will not sell any fabric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third-order construction is enough to support a construction conference? The answer is obviously no. Only in some very special circumstances, such as the initial release of the builder, will not allow the emergence of third-order construction. This is a customary convention. In general, a large architect has a conference, and at least two third-order installations must be made, and innovation is necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the floating islands have received invitations, even the families of Beard, Joseph and Mensa who have fallen to the freezing point with the Archimonde family No exception. But every family has an expectation for tomorrow's press conference, because this third-order structure is mostly very special. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the floating island giants also had a strong interest in the carriage of the Knights brought back by Richard. The reason why the knight is called a knight instead of a warrior is because the mount has a very important position. On the battlefield, the impact of the knight and the warrior is very different. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a limited number of structures and limited average strength of the knights, the ability to improve the ride is an important part. There are many families in the floating island giants who are good at cultivating all kinds of Warcraft. In fact, the main purpose is to cultivate a more powerful knight mount. There are no special restrictions on the structure of the knight's seat. As long as there is enough strength, the rider of the dragon ride has appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard returned to Noland, the news that he was already a 16th-level magician immediately spread in Faust. Counting, even if Richard is at ten times the flow rate of Faro every day, the time from the fifteenth to the sixteenth is not more than half a year! What is the upgrade speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland’s history is a genius, a floating world. If you are less than 20 years old, you will reach 16th grade, and even higher geniuses will have many. However, most of them have undergone rigorous training since childhood and have worked hard for more than ten years. In the past ten years, Richard grew up in a small mountain village and did not receive any systematic training and cultivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, people pay more attention to Richard’s talent in construction, and his personal strength and rank can always be said to be a bad injury. Even if his inheritance is dark blue, he did not let most people change their minds. To know that on the road to the strong, the teacher is only a shortcut, not even a cornerstone. However, people now find that Richard's level of improvement has also begun to put pressure on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Faust was destined to be unsettled. Many people are feeling restless for tomorrow's press conference, which is expected and irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these people, the most special one is probably the Luna, another royal constructor of the Holy Alliance. This time, he also received an invitation, and he was so sullen that he did not shred the invitation directly as he did last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in front of the office desk and stared at the invitation in front of him. The black and white color scheme, which is extremely strong in style, deeply hurts his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just Luno’s stinging, but Feng Stern standing next to him is even more angry. The original handsome face has become bitter because of hatred. He couldn't wait to grab the invitation and tear it away. He even wanted to send the invitation directly to Richard's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if Vonster burned his head with hatred, he knew that the latter could only be an imaginary scene. He also saw the duel between Richard and Xiaomensa, knowing that the result of rushing himself was to give others a cut. If he and Richard have a conflict, the royal family must now stand on the side of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just a year ago, this was never the case. At that time, Vonster was already counting the days when he became a royal builder, and Richard, who knew who Richard was at that time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonster himself had no way to take Richard, but decided to consolidate Luno’s hatred of Richard: "Teacher, this Richard is really arrogant, district A third-order structure is going to be taken out to open a separate conference, and all the big guys are invited! You can make a dozen or so three-level structure of the big builder, and for the past many years, it has not been so publicized. "Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luno’s eyes flashed in anger, but the years of the city and the painful lessons made him force his own anger, and slowly said "Maybe his construction is really special, it is possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But are you really going? This is It’s a matter of losing face identity! I think that Richard actually only wants to sell those mounts that have been taken from the eccentric plane.” Feng Ster continued to provoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luno did not say anything, just staring straight at the invitation. What makes this invitation unique is not just the design style, but the inside pages that list all the invited families and some important people, such as Luno, Nolan and Greek, and Deputy head of the Knights of the Dragon Hall and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go." Luno finally said that suddenly it was like being ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster did not dare to persuade, but thought of something, said: "Teacher, the royal family sent people yesterday to prepare to cut your supply of magic materials." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Luno slammed the table with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a royal builder, his rich body is built on surplus magical materials. In the past, in order to retain him, the conditions given to him by the Holy Alliance were much better than those of the other two empires. This also makes Luno's level lower than that of the other two empire's royal architects, but he is rich, but he still has it. Moreover, his talent has reached its limit, and the hope of impacting the fourth-order construction lies in the small probability event that may occur after consuming a large amount of material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luno also knows that in recent years, he has become less and less self-contained and his quality has declined. But for the fourth-order construction, he was too lazy to manage the royal family. However, I did not expect that the royal family finally reacted after several years of forbearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
