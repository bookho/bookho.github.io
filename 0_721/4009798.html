It feels that the time of this transmission is extraordinarily longer than that of the magical array. In fact, it is only a few seconds longer, but it has already crossed the long-term space that cannot be measured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the portal, in the gap of the plane space, the Archimonde family has established a forward base and is set to guide The lighthouse of the followers. In the vast and turbulent time and space, the time lighthouse will provide stable and clear coordinates to prevent the temporary paving transmission channel from shifting, resulting in the lost of the passer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the information obtained by Richard, the size of the forward base is not large, and the base is not more than 50 people, together with a tamed local indigenous, and a large The adventurer's camp is almost the same. Seventeen people have survived in the early transmission. The radius of the area that has been explored is less than 50 kilometers. It can be said that the whole plane is still at a stage of ignorance. But the coordinates of each stable plane are invaluable. Once completely conquered, it means huge wealth and countless resources. Gordon’s current low-level plane is only one, so Richard has no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a foothold, a relatively safe base, and an advance team member who is already familiar with the environment. Richard is very satisfied. It can be said that many dangers have been avoided in the initial stage of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dazzling white light blew open in front of Richard’s eyes, and his eyes were stinging for a moment, and even the colorful light curtains could not be seen. When the vision is restored, what Richard sees is no longer the ray of light, but the white clouds and the green trees. The soft wind rushed to the surface and told Richard that the new world was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the scene in front of you and Nordland are very similar, except that the main color of the vegetation is purple, I don’t know the season, or it’s all year round, but Under the blue sky, the rolling mountains are covered with deep and shallow purple, which reveals extra vitality. However, Richard couldn’t appreciate the scenery of the new plane. A very strong sense of danger suddenly slammed into his heart. He hadn’t figured out what had happened. The wind screamed in his ear. It was a crying scream, the corner of his eye. After seeing the water splashing, Yu Guang put himself on the ground in a down-to-earth manner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feather arrow is almost stuck in the cheek of Richard’s cheek, and the sharp wind spurs his eyes sour, and the arrow shaft exposed on the ground Uninterrupted, still trembled, making a heart-rending snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again passing the death, Richard calmed down a lot. Enemy! It was his first thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me!" Water Peanut said hard, like a cheetah bounces, the shape constantly changes the running path, twists and turns rushing to the nearest A big tree. Richard also jumped up and jumped up and followed her without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Archimonde's stepping knight ran past them, but did not rush a few steps, a few arrows screamed, Pinned to him, the boring sound of the meat makes people feel sour. The step knight continued to run with his teeth, trying to find a bunker, and then at this moment, a sharp whistling sound, a hand axe flew and flew, and instantly hit the knight, the axe blade had completely fallen into his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Steps made a painful cry and finally fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard was able to distinguish between various sounds. Shouting and killing came one after another, coming from all directions, apparently they were already surrounded. And the constant painful roar came out from the woods. Some of the sounds were very familiar to Richard. They were step-by-step knights, and some of them were unfamiliar and weird. That should be the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly observed the surrounding environment. This is a sparse forest of mixed forests, with occasional shrubs and occasionally a few large old trees. Deep in the depths of the trees, you can see the agile warrior, who is approaching this side with the cover of the trees and grass. From the action of the enemy, Richard judged that they were at least five or more fighters, familiar with the mountain battles, and the proportion of shooters was high. The only good news is that so far no sound of magic attacks has been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After observing, Li quickly ran to the big tree that was found by the one who was found in the water. When he arrived at the bunker, the girl immediately jumped out like a wolf, and rushed to the enemy in the depths of the woods with extraordinary agility. In the forest environment, Richard is confident in the water level in the face of his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, in the blink of an eye there is a constant scream, and in the woods, the gesture of the splash is like a real moon wolf, is putting an enemy Throw down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly stabilized his mood and quickly added himself to the magic shield and stone skin surgery, which began to sneak into the most fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a short distance from the front, Gangde’s roar suddenly sounded, and then his burly body rushed out from the middle of the two trees that were tightly intertwined. The vines hung from the canopy did not hinder him, and seemed to fall like a sharp cut. He had a big upper body and could see a long arrow on his back. However, Gangde’s temperament was strong and strong, and it was obvious that the arrow did not affect his combat effectiveness. His hand holds a trunk that doesn't know where it came from, thicker than his muscle-tangled arms, and the trunk is covered with red, white blood and brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows around the woods are fascinating, and the enemy is cautiously forming a situation, but the injured and unfavorable battles have not only failed to smother Gangde’s fighting spirit, but have even more His fierceness. As he strode forward, he waved the trunk, and the heavy footsteps shook the earth and trembled. The roar sounded like a thunder in the forest: "The reptiles! Let me roll out and die! Don't think that these are similar to toothpicks." The thick saplings can protect you. I can smell the smell of your body after a few kilometers! The big axe in my hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde’s voice Suddenly, he looked at the trunk in his hand and did not know how to proceed. At the time of transmission, all of the weapons are handled in a uniform package to save the mana of the transmission channel. So now his big axe is not in his hand, but in a tightly packed weapon box. But obviously killing is more important than the slogan, so Gangde just paused for a moment and continued to growl: "All of my guys are hungry and thirsty! Shake, reptiles!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! The answer to Gangde is a sharp arrow flying from the side. However, he showed the agility that was inconsistent with his body shape in an instant. A side jump easily let the arrow pass, and then the trunk covered with blood-stained blood flew out and slammed into the woods with a strong wind. Only the shooter of the half body is exposed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones shattered and the sound of the shooter suddenly twisted and twisted, and even the cockroaches couldn’t make a sound, and they fell down. Gangde looked around and couldn't see the weapon that was easy to handle. He simply pulled a big trunk around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle sounds in the other direction were suddenly intensive, and the four stepping knights were in the middle of the squad, and they continued to move backwards. They were armed, and only one had a shield in their hands, and the other two held a long knife and axe. Lee Arrow shot from the woods in a round, and the four stepping knights were already wounded. However, each knight shines with a faint glow. As soon as the arrow touches the light, it immediately enters the water, and the castration stagnate, and the strength and speed are at least half weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
