After re-creating the army of the Duke of Elbow in the private sector, unless the Duke made up his mind to eradicate Richard and complete the army, Richard had already proved by facts that the force of that rank could not be allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Duke is really desperate to send a large army, then Richard does not mind spending a few months in his bloody land. And he also believes that the Duke's enemies will be very happy to see the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Richard nodded to Him as he had a tacit understanding, then swept his eyes to the other aristocratic representatives and said, "Which is there?" If you want to join the coalition, or if you have better suggestions, or simply quit, you can say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the example of the Viscount of Heim, there are a few The aristocratic representative said hesitantly joined the coalition. Soon, Richard found that he had thousands of knights and more than 5,000 infantry. This does not include his own troops. This situation, to be honest, is beyond the expectation of Richard. He really did not think of the influence and appeal of the Viscounts of Him in the nobility. Maybe he is not a man, but there is a huge family behind him. When people think about every word that Shim said, the first thing to think about is whether he represents who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged aristocrat coughed and asked: "Hello, if we don't join the coalition, don't know what the consequences will be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ri shrugged and said: "There is no consequence. But if you don't join the coalition's family, you will have trouble in the bloody land in the future."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged aristocrat is wary and asks: "What is the trouble? After your plan is successful, isn't it said that a safe passage will be opened in the blood-stained area?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "That channel is indeed safe, but it is only for families joining the coalition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you mean?" The eyes of the middle-aged aristocrats became very sharp. Behind him is a powerful count, who has always been respected and flattered in the social circle of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The land of blood can be safe or dangerous." Richard explained patiently, although his smile was very dangerous: "For example, the red Cossack The caravans have recently been in trouble. For them, the bloody land is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged aristocratic face became very ugly, stunned Sit down and sit down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of Richard is very clear, that is, he does not want to join the coalition forces, but in the future, the forces of this family may be attacked as long as they enter the blood-stained land. It doesn't matter where the attack comes from. For example, Richard is a pioneer who can rise in the blood-stained land. It is only a matter of minutes before the army becomes a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a violation of the rules, or even a threat. Because since they are not aligned, Richard has no obligation to them. Rights and obligations have always only corresponded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand the rules of the game, and some of the nobles present began to express their desire to join the coalition. In the hands of Richard, there were 1,500 knights available, and the infantry reached as many as 10,000 people! As a result, Richard had to limit the size of the infantry of the later entrants and increased the level and equipment requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line plan requires a soldier with sufficient maneuverability, rather than a large army of mediocrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the aristocratic representatives gradually became active, but Richard was not happy at all. He stared at the viscount of Heim, but the viscount, who seemed to be more rounded and rounded, immediately returned with a smile that even had some flattering invitations, which made Richard laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan of Richard is indeed to open the way to the blood-stained land. But it doesn't need so many troops, and it doesn't need so much family support. In fact, there is no support from the nobility. With the foundation of the armed forces and allies that Richard now possesses, and the existence of the mother's nest, it is also possible to independently open the road to the dwarf empire, but it takes only a long time. And in the later stages of the beginning of the benefits, it is necessary to guard against threats from the rear, after all, nominally, Richard is currently a small lord of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why all relevant aristocrats should be convened to discuss together, in fact, Richard is considering for the future, this meeting has been opened, Richard is equivalent to declare Freely expand the legitimacy of the blood-stained land, and lay the groundwork for his future monopoly of the bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a big piece of cake, Richard actually wants to swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn’t expect to pop up a Viscount! The unicorn Viscount’s attitude toward Richard not only made a complete turn, but also completely destroyed Richard’s original plan in such a peculiar way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the coalition is not an option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking very fast, and his talents are moving at full speed, thinking about the current situation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the formation of coalition forces is also beneficial, and Richard can have a large number of troops on his hands, and plans to open the blood-stained land will inevitably accelerate. On the other hand, thinking far and deep, Richard is an alien invader, but the aristocrats who have deep cooperation with him will inevitably be suspected of cooperating with the invaders in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity will also compromise, but for the gods this is a matter of principle, not to be reluctant! Everyone who works with the invaders will be sent to the first shelf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard and so on have a number of natural allies, but they are still ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another afternoon of intense discussions, the line plan was finally formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of six nobility exit plans, the rest are willing to join the coalition, and handed over the command to Richard. The final size of the coalition forces is two thousand knights and eight thousand infantry. The logistics units of the joint efforts of the families have totaled 30,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of Richard’s own troops is nearly 3,000. However, this time the implementation of the line plan, Richard is only ready to dispatch 1,500 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the plan is successful, the channel will open, and Richard will receive a 25% benefit. On the surface, the proportion of income does not match the strength of Richard, but the Viscount of Hem is strongly supported, and the soul of the coalition is the highest commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hem so enthusiastically supported Richard, in the eyes of other nobles, it is equivalent to the attitude of the highland unicorn family. Since the relationship between the two hostile lords looks too strange, the nobles of the meeting can't help but associate the Duke of Glasgow and the Duke of the Wolf, which are standing behind each other, so they can't help but try to figure out the color and the voice of opposition. It is not so effective, and this distribution plan is finally determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a favorite banquet for the nobility, but everyone did not want to participate, but chose to pass the message back in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead of night, Richard was alone in the combat room, and began to calculate the success or failure of the plan against the map of the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan is successful, the total revenue will reach the scale of 10 million coins! But correspondingly, the investment is also huge. The military and military deaths of the entire coalition will reach an astonishing two million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vertical line plan is not successful, then the military spending will rise sharply while the gains are zero. This is where the risk lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertical line is an action that Richard originally planned to take a year to complete, relying on the huge benefits brought to and from Noland, and the nest. The high-level warriors created by the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan is successful, Richard will not only harvest a value-for-money trade line, but his own strength will become one of the core forces of the blood-stained land. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s other purpose is to nail the nails that must be removed on the route of the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His route is not arbitrarily chosen, and those that must be removed are either possessed minerals that have not been fully exploited in Faro, such as the Ground Crack Canyon. The cloud iron ore, such as the fire-striped stone of the Black Flame Mountain, can be used to get a lot of divine items. For example, the Camp Noto Camp consists of dozens of large and small tribes, the ruins of the Jubval, where the legendary troll country is located, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals also need to be divided among the nobility, and those with divinity, such as sacrificial statues, are all needed by the hens. Big complement. The nest that is stuck in the fifth order can no longer be promoted by magic crystal and eating. Its promotion requires the support of divinity. These items, in the eyes of the nobles even the shrine gods, should also be a waste of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only trouble is how the sacred officials like Liusha stand in front of aristocrats. However, the Faro plane is extremely broad, and it is even more of the gods. How many true gods there are, that is, only the gods with medium divine power can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long years of thousands of years, there have been gods and gods, and new gods have been born. If you look at the history of the entire plane, there is no such thing as a mortal person who knows how many true gods have been born in history. Because the gods and the priesthood are the greatest secrets, the books of the gods that record the elements of the true gods are so important, and they are forbidden by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true God may fall, may also close the Kingdom of God, temporarily fall asleep, and may even turn to a mortal with blood, expecting to reignite the fire . Therefore, many new gods that have been born in the history of Faro are actually the resurrection of ancient gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of God is so complex that it is impossible to master the priests who are mortal. So when two strange clergy encounter each other, the first thing is to test the other's level of magic and divine power. This is a way of identifying the camp, such as deceiving and lie to the two gods of the gods, the service is likely to conflict. The gods of order and chaos are naturally opposite. However, as long as they are not natural opposition or conflicting gods, the priests will not easily conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
