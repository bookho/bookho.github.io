			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two years of support for the integral system is no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no Richard’s fifth-order costume and Midalun’s suit, the no-host-hosted sacrifice seems to be more overbearing than Richard’s. One. The characteristics of the Richard sacrifice are various materials, so the feature of the faceless sacrifice is the artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same number of sacrifices, the facelessness of even the face is even more than Richard, and the proportion of artifacts inside is also exceptionally high. Although most of them are artifacts of the original level, artifacts are artifacts, and no one is comparable to legendary equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, although there is no structure, there is a lot of artifact support, and the point system is still running. In addition, Qi Qi will put some second-order suits from time to time, so the attracting strong is still a lot, and Archimonde has the corresponding financial resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively speaking, the dragon plane is somewhat silent, and the abyss is the hottest point battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss is vast and vast, and the expedition of Richard has proved the path to other abyss. Although the waterway is narrow and the environment is much suppressed by humans, it is almost a treasure trove of resources, so a large number of strong people flood into the abyss and continue to kill the demons. In terms of value, the abyss demon is not lower than the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another surprise to Richard is that the Star Sage has always stayed. With him, the entire point battlefield has a guarantee of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran superpower, Xing Xian’s reputation is even bigger than Richard’s. Although he is not known for his combat power, but the super strong is the super strong, the nebula chain is almost synonymous with perfect defense, and his space ability also makes many strong people reluctant to easily challenge him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard knows that this is the Star Sage who is repaying himself. However, when he is deeply immersed in the dark territory, the Star Sage can defend the point battlefield for three years, and the significance is far more than that. With him, the Archimonde family is equivalent to having a super strong person. Other giants are no longer eager to move, nor dare to mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is the case of two planes. In Faro's mother's nest, it should now be called the mountain and the sea. The body has reached fifteen levels, and it is only one step away from the 16th level of the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the reaper's war, the population of Faro has dropped sharply, and the number of believers and the power of faith have also been greatly reduced. It is impossible to maintain a large number of true gods. Even the three goddesses can barely maintain the power of God without downgrading, and the other gods are even worse. From time to time, there are news that the gods are downgraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the mother nest finally began to work on some less important gods. This time, even the three goddesses rarely stood on the side of the mother's nest, but they did not have the guts to stand on the opposite side of the mother's nest. Eventually an unprecedented war broke out in the history of Faro. One side is the mother's nest, and the other side is all true gods except the three goddesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of the war ended in the victory of the mother's nest. In the three years of war, the gods of the Faro were degraded, and only three true gods survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has been recorded in the history of the gods of Faro and is called the dusk of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen gods and their gods have all become the food of the mother's nest, with a lot of divine supplements, and the mother's nest and the mountains and the sea are cleared. The ultimate obstacle to the promotion. Since the integration of mountains and seas with the mother's nest, the number of divines required for the promotion of the ranks has increased greatly, because the two real names need to be promoted separately, which is equivalent to consuming twice as much resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not take long for the mountains and the sea to enter the 16th order, and the mother's nest will officially become the mother. In Green Forest, the nest of the mother's nest is not so fast, it only reached the 12th order, but with the help of the Golden World tree, it has the energy of the sanctuary of the night elves. In Green Forest, a terrible army has gradually been hoarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has always been committed to creating combat units, and has never changed from start to finish, so its ability in this field is more than the nest. Now the hen's nest can create a combat unit with a greatly enhanced ability in one aspect at the cost of lowering the first order. For example, a special night-enhanced elf shooter with enhanced vision will even surpass the Sanctuary level elf shooter in combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Richard saw the ability of the hen’s avatar, he immediately thought of another, more important application, that is wisdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark night elves after the great enhancement of wisdom are comparable in wisdom to the elite units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector used an afternoon to learn more about the situation when he left this time, let the followers leave, and then call the faceless to their study room. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Richard looked at the faceless and said very seriously: "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless mask floated up with a smile and said: "Light thank you Not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, a thank you is not enough. In the reaper's war, no face is a great achievement, her role is very subtle, but it is everywhere. Countless small local wins have accumulated, and they have changed from quantitative to qualitative, and have become a big victory that can affect the entire situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no point exchange system established by the faceless, Richard will not be able to accumulate a huge amount of wealth in the short term to defeat the Reaper. Although the war with the Reaper was very heavy, the entire Faro and the destruction were only one line. But Richard's gains are huge, and the essence of the embers is only a small part. The hundreds of millions of souls that have been redeemed are the real wealth. It was their innumerable obstacles that led Richard to cross the rule of the road in one fell swoop, and finally stood on the highest peak of the entire Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abyss, there is no face to accompany Richard to the end. Only she can stand by Richard until the two mysterious and terrifying existences in the deepest part of the Abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was in the darkness, she propped up the entire Archimonde and allowed the point redemption system to be maintained, for Akmon Germany has accumulated a huge amount of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be said that there is no faceless, there is no Richard and Archimonde today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, looking at no face, Richard did not know what to say at the moment, and finally asked: "How did you come back from the abyss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others were sent back by Richard with the portal. Richard originally intended to open the world channel and let the faceless guard channel go to the world to explore. Unexpectedly, just after the war, he was taken to the dark area by a man on the throne, and no face was left in the abyss of Abis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original way back." The faceless answer made Richard quite speechless. Even if Richard himself, it would not be easy to return to the original route, but no face does not seem to be too much explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the face, I looked at Richard and said, "Your harvest in the dark area is not small!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked at it and didn't know how it was seen without face. Speaking of his real gain, but the analysis of thirty-six twisted rules, now back to Noland, these distortion rules are of no use. Therefore, in his own strength, Richard did not feel that he had too much gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing seems to know what Richard is thinking, not to mention, directly looking for a mirror to put in front of Richard, let him see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked into the mirror, only to find that the inside of the map itself is somewhat distorted, and the body is still faint with the black gas. Of course, those are not ordinary black gas, but the light band produced by the regular forces, which are constantly extinguished in the body of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that he has not completely shaken off the influence of dark areas, and has been unknowingly using the power of twisting rules, although only a little bit However, it is always suppressed by the Norland plane rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he came back too quickly, and he’s barely stayed in the semi-level, and once he’s on the floating island, he’s going to know the whole situation in Archimonde. So I didn't notice the abnormality in my body. In the dark area for too long, those days that can't be distinguished from day and night, in the heart of Richard, have been for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw myself in the mirror, there was still some time between Richard and I didn’t want to suppress the twisting rules. After a while, he adjusted his body little by little and completely integrated into Noland's plane rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting down the twisting rules, Richard suddenly felt that the whole body was loose, the whole world became brighter, and many invisible shackles that were originally pressed on the body were broken. Now Richard has once again become a super strongman who belongs to Noland. Every super-powerful person controls more or less the underlying rules of the plane. In this sense, it is not too much to call them the son of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly put down the burden, Richard couldn’t help but move his body and sighed freely. But with his movements, a faint snoring suddenly sounded in the study, and everything seemed to lose weight in a flash, flying up, and then slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Weiwei, his perception is so powerful at the moment, with the help of the rules, instantly spread to all directions, even beyond the fascination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
