			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee does not think about it, instinctively knocks on the desk, leaning against the table The elf's long knife suddenly came out of the sheath and jumped into the right hand of Richard. In the narrow study, the long elf knife was very difficult to display, but Richard slashed like a wind, but like a fierce battle in the wilderness, he opened wide and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s knife screamed, and the blade edge suddenly burst into a green brilliance, and the blade was no longer visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shadow warriors did not know when they appeared, they each held a shadow giant axe, the axe blade just lie in the position where Richard was originally stationed. If the reaction of Richard is a little slower, he will be divided into two shadow warriors with the equivalent of fifteenth level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Warrior missed a hit, returned to the axe and looked up, just want to continue chasing, but the eyes are filled with countless green knives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first seemingly soft and harmless blue-colored knife light gently passes over the shadow of the samurai's chest, but like the water in the oil, the knife light The shadows around are all boiling. The shadow power is constantly torn from the body, and then annihilated by the blue knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Warriors suddenly screamed in pain, their shouts have no sound, but they have the power to tear the soul, some similar to the effect of the banshee, but Not so strong. However, Richard's soul is strong, and he once took the gun of the soul of the Troll Superintendent. The bark of the two shadow warriors in the district is only a breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the knife in both hands, and when his left hand also holds the handle, a pair of forearms suddenly radiate a faint bloody brilliance, and the knife is shining, thousands of times. Strong, if the wind and rain suddenly splashed into the two shadow warriors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife is raining, passing in an instant, then pouring it on the opposite wall, leaving countless criss-crossing marks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shadowed warriors stood in the same place, and suddenly there was a net woven from countless green thin lines, and then the body and the weapons in their hands suddenly exploded. Hundreds of pieces of finely divided shadows, then annihilated by green thin lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few whispers, four shadow drills fell on the floor, bouncing a few times, rolling around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s double-handed knife still maintains a straight-forward posture, but it’s a look of surprise, it’s hard to believe that this time it’s so easy to eliminate it. Four shadows of life! Like the last time, the giant axe in the hands of the two shadow warriors is actually an independent shadow life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers the last time the shadow warrior, but almost got his life on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dense nicks on the opposite wall faithfully recorded how many knives had been revealed at that moment. This is not only the reason for the magical armed forces, but also the power of life. Each of Richard’s arms has one life, and the two are superimposed to show the true power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life that claims to be the first to kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the extra damage to the shadow creature in the elf knife is negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a knife out, Richard suddenly felt that the body was extremely empty, regardless of the magical strength, was exhausted, his hands were soft, almost even The knife can't hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is always in the pursuit of ultimate killing, while consuming the same horror. This is the structure for the strong people above the sanctuary, but Richard is used on himself, and it is still two at a time. As a result, the knife was really amazing, but it also took Richard directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha directly throws the elf knife into the ground, and strongly supports to find a bottle of vitality, almost even the cork can not be opened, before and after A few times the strength is considered to be successful. Filling up the vitality agent, Richard directly sat on the chair and waited for physical recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the small footsteps suddenly sounded at the entrance of the study, and the door was gently ringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very upset in the heart, who will come to the study at this time? Listening to the sound of knocking on the door is not an old butler, but like a weak girl. But the favorite camouflage of the assassin killer is a seemingly harmless girl, child, or old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who, wait a moment." Richard adjusted his posture in a quiet manner, taking out the book from his arms and gently placed it on his desk. And then open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am, master." The sound of cocoa came from outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." Richard said calmly, but he did not dare to relax in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed open and Coco came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s eyes immediately shot a faint glow, sweeping her whole body up and down. Seeing the girl in front of her is not a killer camouflage, and she did not bring any weapon, Richard was really relieved. However, he still maintains a full-scale alert and does not dare to relax a little. Somehow, Richard always felt that there seemed to be a huge danger hidden in the darkness. But no matter how he perceives the exploration, he can't find the source of the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cocoa, it’s too late, why don’t you sleep? Do you have anything?” Richard asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa is obviously extremely cramped, with both hands clasping the clothes, but not knowing how to open. After a full minute of this, she finally made up her mind to take a folded piece of paper from her arms, spread it out, put it in front of Richard, and then stepped back two steps, waiting for Richard's hair to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a bit strange. When I open the piece of paper, the expression on my face is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is a miniature version of the map on the wall of Richard, especially the labels that Richard added for each territory. Chu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and asked, "Is this thing drawn by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The cocoa sound was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much can this item sell?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is willing to buy with 10,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not leaving the floating island More, how do you know how much this map can be sold?" Richard continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... a former colleague of Irvine, he found me and said that he hopes to get the information of your next move. They robbed the sacrifice. I am very worried now," Coco said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The picture is good, have you handed it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I... thought for a long time, still can't walk that step. So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "It’s not good to sell. However, you can actually take this thing down, for example, this thing, just tear it up. After throwing it, no one knows what you did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa suddenly had a rare courage and said, "I...in that case, I will sleep." No, it’s better to say it and accept punishment than to be painful as it is now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee threw the map on the table, sinking, Then ask: "Are you short of money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you think I hate you?" Cocoa took the courage to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only smiled and repeated his question: "Are you short of money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The courage of cocoa disappeared instantly, bowing his head and saying softly: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that as your partner, you always receive a standard allowance. Three times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa looked up and looked straight at Richard and said, "But that is not enough. My father’s debt, my brother’s trial, need Money, a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is 10,000 gold coins enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Reluctantly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, and now he understands that Cocoa made this decision and really needs a lot of courage. Selling the map, she can at least temporarily ease the dilemma at home, but in the end, she still handed the map up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha tapped the table and began to seriously think about the problems she faced. After a while, she said, "Okay, my principle is that I can forgive mistakes, but never Tolerate betrayal, and honest people deserve to be rewarded. Since this map has not been sold, then this incident has not happened. Your father’s debt is well resolved, you can go to the old butler and let him from me. Take out the gold coins and repay those debts. As for your brother...the nature of his actions is too bad, all I can do is to give him care, not to be disabled or die during hard labor. In addition, I can try to give the victim a compensation. If they are willing to accept compensation and forgive your brother's actions, then the hard time limit can be shortened appropriately. But that's all. The specific size is determined by the old butler. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa has turned from sorrow to surprise, and many days of minds have been resolved, so that her tears can no longer stop, such as springs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the map and threw it back to Cocoa. He smiled and said, "This picture is good, don't waste it. You take it back, Who to sell to whom, but 10,000 is too cheap, a price, less than 50,000 do not sell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa looked up in surprise, Say: "No! I can't do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" Richard said with a smile. "This is what I let you sell, and yourself." The nature of private transactions is completely different. You can do it by the way, you can make a profit by the way. Since these guys have too many gold coins, they don’t earn money. But the asking price you started is really low, our information about Archimonde. It is now more precious than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
