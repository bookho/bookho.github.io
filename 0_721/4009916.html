			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield was quickly cleared, and Richard turned over and led the lack of sleep. The team started, the wolves have been chasing them up, and then it will be a long and difficult tug of war surrounded and separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of Richard’s march has always been erratic. This team first moved to the northeast, and after a few kilometers, turned north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall barbarian can't ride horses, but they are running faster than ordinary people, and the endurance is unexpectedly long, but after all, can't Compared with the short-legged horses produced in the blood-stained areas. This kind of horse is suitable for the sand people to ride, the short-distance sprint has no merit, and the endurance and adaptability far exceeds the tall horses of the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team keeps moving at a medium speed, and the wind teeth are alert within a few hundred meters. With their more sensitive sense of smell and induction than humans, Richard can blur the movement of large-scale ** within a kilometer, which is also an important basis for his team to fine-tune the direction of movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of Richard is to finally go north and enter the territory of the Iron Triangle Empire. There is a good chance to find the forward base of the town bear knights and a vital time lighthouse. And there are mountains, lush forests and a lot of fierce Warcraft. In the complex terrain of mountains and forests, the red Cossacks will not be able to play a quantitative advantage, and the strength of this team will be maximized. Powerful mages and priests, as well as contract professionals, are always a trump card in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Richard didn’t know how the red Cossacks behind him were adorned with each other accurately, and how quietly assembled such a huge force of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial encounter with the red Cossacks did not cause him enough vigilance, but the attack became endless, and several familiar faces continued Appears after the healing cycle. Richard realized that the scattered enemies had begun to organize in a way that he did not know. He only knows that the enemy may pounce on himself from all directions, anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No backup is Richard’s biggest disadvantage, and he only mechanically repels the enemy’s offensive once and for all, and with his keen grasp of the regional situation, Lead the troops to move constantly, and jump out of the encirclement that will be gathered again and again. Then smash the enemy's pursuit and block, and then jump out of the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, whenever possible, Richard steadfastly moved to the north, but the enemy clearly noticed his intentions, and the troops deployed in the north were significantly more than other directions. Much more. At this time, Richard decisively changed the route of travel, and suddenly suddenly attacked the east, defeated the frontal enemy, and left the main force of the red Cossack behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at the northern end of the blood-stained land, the wolves and prey began repeated pursuits and counterattacks. Both sides seem to have achieved their goals. Richard was forced to deviate from the destination in the north, but he repeatedly escaped from the red Cossacks and gave the enemy a lot of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to think about it, the ups and downs are getting bigger and bigger. In addition to trying to drive Richard away from the Iron Triangle Empire, the Red Cossacks also deviated from the main trade routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to their understanding, Richard is not without a foundation in the blood-stained land. This is not enough to make him a substantial reinforcement, but the message is delivered. Still not difficult. The red Cossacks did not have the intelligence network to block the entire blood-stained land. They had to grab the power behind Richard to get rid of the arrogant boy who dared to challenge the red Cossack reputation. Once the safari became war, it would not meet them. The interests of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering the red Cossack's attempt, Richard immediately adhered to the principle that the enemy did not want you to do the most, and as long as he had the opportunity to go to the business road, he could not touch the main line, but also passed near the branch line. Of course, he has no news to pass, but to contain the enemy's deployment, and occasionally get extra personnel and material supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has encountered two small-scale caravans, and after simple persuasion, he received the caravan's supplies and guards. Behind Richard is the red Cossack's pursuer. If the two small caravans let the red Cossack see it, they will inevitably be wiped out. In bloody places, this kind of thing is very common, and large slave traders usually work part-time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after continuous combat reduction, Richard still led the troops of nearly 500 people. War is the best furnace, and people are ore. After the ore is put into the furnace, it is partially condensed into fine iron and partially converted into waste residue. In the blood-stained area, the waste will basically become a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding in the battle, while heading north, Richard is quietly calculating the power of his hand. There were 821 people joining his team, and now there are only 460 soldiers left, and the difference between them has become a dead body. The ones who finally survived became calm and ferocious warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard himself, under the continuous high-intensity command, the only gain is that the wisdom talent has made a breakthrough and entered the second stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new stage does not seem to be fundamentally different from the first stage, but the thinking speed is much faster, basically reaching an unforgettable level, for the perspective of data. Processing power is also greatly enhanced. Intuitively, the original chaotic and complex battlefield is now simpler and clearer, and Richard can also clarify the situation in a shorter period of time, thus issuing more orders. Within a unit of time, the number of orders he can release has doubled, that is, the ability to control the battlefield has doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of several hundred people is just right for the current Richard, and can fully utilize his abilities. But it is one thing to clearly understand and think about the reaction. It is another thing to get accurate conclusions. Whether the decision is correct or not has little to do with the ability to deal with the numbers. The improvement of wisdom talent only makes Richard reduce the chance of making mistakes because of hasty and unreasonable thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the powerful effects of wisdom have been reflected in the war. More than 400 warriors have fully adapted to Richard’s command and have become a whole. Even if they are attacked by powerful enemy forces in the battle that just happened, they can lift the chaos and adjust the formation in the shortest possible time. And reconstituted the indestructible battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Richard, this small army, originally composed of various races and different warriors, has become like the most sophisticated Alchemy machinery harvests the enemy's life with incredible efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a hundred kilometers from Richard, a train team is driving on the desolate Gobi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the team, but it’s not the trucks of the regular caravans, but the passenger carriages painted with scarlet paint. A centered carriage is decorated with low-key and luxurious features. The horse is driven by a tall horse. The four-wheeled carriage of the carriage is equipped with a magical machine that can absorb shocks. Under the magical effect, it can even float for a short time when passing through the most rugged road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the manual fee is neglected, the material value of the carriage itself is more than 100,000 gold coins, and the use is of course not just to provide comfort during long-distance travel. In fact, this is a magical chariot. The function is to provide a quiet and stable environment during the long march to march, so that the magicians can meditate to restore the magic. Moreover, a special magic array is arranged inside the carriage, which is driven by magic crystal and can accelerate the process of magician meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
