			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden scream of screaming in the distance, obviously dying The former screams. The screams spurred the Viscount's nerves, so that his legs could not support the body, and he sat down on the ground. The pro-arms quickly grabbed and protected the Viscount. The opposite empire veteran smirked, slamming, vomiting heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the veteran’s sneer was so dazzling in the eyes of Him, and the Viscount’s eyes appeared in front of Li’s eyes with a deep wound last night, if nothing happened from him. Walk through and go to the night to attack the scene of the much more powerful emperor. The two images are intertwined, like a fire, and I completely ignite the nerves of Him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xim suddenly felt a bloody red in front of his eyes, he suddenly uttered a beast-like roar, I don’t know where the great power, pushing a pro-arm, a sword Rushed to the opposite empire veteran! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the thorn sword that is more decorative is actually a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the sword was deeply immersed in the heart of the veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran’s face was incredibly stunned and slowly fell. And he was staring at this opponent who had fought a few rounds with himself, and did not understand what happened. Until the pro-entrums exclaimed "You are hurt!", Heim felt the pain in his shoulders. He looked down and saw that when he had a wound with more than a dozen centimeters on his shoulder, the blood was pouring out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him suddenly remembered Richard and remembered the rolled wound on Richard. So the screams that had already reached the throat were swallowed back. In the horrified eyes of the soldiers, the Viscount tore the shirt and threw it on the ground, revealing the whole upper body, and then sat down on the stool in a big way, and shouted to the soldiers: "What are you going to panic! Come over and help me. On the bag! I haven't finished it yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, he felt that he had a bit of insight. But what Li revealed was a block of muscles and a sharp-edged body, while Him's upper body was white and delicate. The upper body of the Viscount has only curves and no corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers quickly wrapped up the wounds for the Viscount, and he ignored the dissuasion and left the house and took to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning, the Viscount was out of control, and when the night fell again, there were four dead souls under his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the city, Richard left the fate of the twins, the right hand is a long knife extinct, is carrying a team of humanoid warriors, murderously through two Hengjie blocked the back road of hundreds of imperial infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard turned out from another street. Opposite him, dozens of imperial infantry emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, the long knife extinct the knife tip, the pace at the foot is getting faster and faster, heading for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only more than 30 humanoid fighters follow behind Richard, they never know what is fear, as long as there is an order, even if there are hundreds of enemies on the opposite side It is also correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard violently crashed into the Imperial Infantry, suddenly a group of hundreds of slaves emerged from the opposite side. They have no other equipment besides a sword in their hands. But when they saw the Imperial Infantry, these slaves rushed up like crazy, ignoring the huge equipment and strength gap between the two sides, screaming and trying to puncture their weapons into the enemy's body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fierce hand-to-hand combat, only a dozen of the nearly 100 imperial infantrymen broke through and escaped into an alley next to them. More than a hundred slaves followed suit. The slaves who killed the imperial soldiers cut their ears of war and hung them around their waists as proof of military merit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sigh of relief, and the unspeakable exhaustion has come out from all over the body, so that he only wants to fall down and find a place to sleep well. feel. His head is also like a crack, and the long-term command of dozens of targets has caused Richard's brain to overdraw. The second consciousness has long been involved in combat command, so the burden and consumption are doubled. The whole city is a battlefield. The soldiers on both sides have already had me in you. I have you in them. At any time, you may encounter enemies and friendly forces at the next intersection. Richard reluctantly commanded his own warriors and followers, turning them into time and turning them into the most sturdy grinding teeth, constantly eroding the flesh and blood of the enemy in this meat grinder-like battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Richard has dried up, the scrolls have been used up, and even the physical strength is consumed. He broke into a broken house on the side of the road, sat down against the wall, and gasped like a fish on the shore. The humanoid warriors have left the team and headed for the next battlefield. If you look at it from the air, you can see that their destination is a small square, where there are hundreds of imperial infantry, they are surrounded by a great magician. The magician is singing a spell, and the gorgeous staff is constantly waving, shooting a fireball into the ruins of the surrounding room. The screams that sound from time to time verify the magical power of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are already four teams of more than a hundred humanoid warriors rushing to the small square from all directions, and behind a second floor, they are assembled Multiple throwing soldiers. Now the throwing soldiers are holding a variety of weapons, their throwing axes and bone blades have long been used up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sigh of relief and continues to accumulate physical strength. Don't look at it, he knows that the great magician is finished. Because the twilight is in the ruins of less than 20 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of footsteps outside the house. A person probed the room and glanced at it. Then he screamed and rushed into the room, staring at the surprise. The hands of the fate in the hands of Richard. This is an empire veteran, and it is a seven-level strength, it should be a junior officer. He looked at Richard and smiled. "It turned out to be a magician! It’s not a small task to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up without saying a word The left hand carries the fate of Gemini, while the right hand is the long knife extinct. However, the imperial sergeant was relieved, and the opposite magician apparently dried up, and at first glance, the rookie who was close to the battle, actually took the knife and knife together. Unmagic Master, he can easily put a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly jumped a few steps, roaring, and extinct to the head of the sergeant! The sergeant sneered and the Sabre greeted the extinction. The two knives intersected, and when they slammed, the extinction suddenly flew out and was nailed directly to the roof. The extinction is coming, but it is just a touch. The sergeant suddenly used the wrong force, and he could not help but walk a big step forward, and Richard stepped forward at the same time, fluttering with the sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a muffled sound, the heavy fate of the twins linger on the back of the sergeant, the engraved work of the beautifully fallen angels is immediately covered with blood and Brain pulp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! A rookie! It’s so deceiving." Richard didn’t look at the fallen sergeant, but the fallen angel statue with his cloak on his head. I wiped it off, cleaned up the things I had on it, and then apologized to it: "Sorry, man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legendary level The fate of Gemini is not the first time this kind of thing has been done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
