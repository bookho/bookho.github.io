			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a huge number is beyond the expectation of Richard, when the current sands raised Iowa and Naiyou, the cost may not have a faceless one percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after level 25, there is still a need for a first-class sacrifice! Richard has a first-class sacrifice, that is, himself. If he sacrifices himself, he should be able to return to the first step. In the history of Noland, this should also be unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned, and finally accepted the reality after a while, silently moving towards the transmission. He now understands that perhaps only the higher-level planes, such as the world in which the ancient stars lived, are the places where no face should go. Only in that kind of place can we afford the huge consumption of no-faced promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the moment he seems to understand a little bit of what the old dragon said at the moment, "Can you be sure that it is good for her to find the sand?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to step into the portal, the flying beast suddenly came back with a shocking picture! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper staying in the base suddenly started to act. They are divided into dozens of teams, and they rushed out of the base like a bee colony. The marine units jumped into a transport ship, then formed in the air and began to rush to the south! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper is starting to act again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time differently, the reaper did not accumulate a large number of troops, trying to beat Richard one time, but turned into more than a dozen troops of different sizes. Pounce in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Reaper has changed his strategy and is prepared to gradually consume Richard’s strength with constant harassment and slowly drag him down. On a large-scale battlefield, the superpowers like Richard are so powerful that they can destroy dozens of small fighters in an attack, especially in a dense formation. The number of reapers is huge, and they can't stand Richard's slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard clearly caught the soft underbelly of the Reaper, and his blue fire actually refining and purifying the essence of the embers. In this way, the reaper's manufacture of a large number of low-end warfare machinery is like sending the essence of the embers to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what puzzled Richard was that the Reaper created more than a dozen new warships and fighters. The shape of these fighters is obviously different from the previous ones. A large number of small fighters were captured by the warships, and then the dozens of giant ships were lifted up in sequence, and they continued to fly high until they reached the end of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and suddenly he was shocked: "That is the battleship to attack the kingdom of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing also said: "Yes. But the Kingdom of God is not so easy to break. Faro is not high in this place, and God is quite a lot. The Reapers have to attack one by one, how can they have to spend one? Two years. We still have time. Let your three goddess hide away. At this time, we can't stop the attack on the kingdom of God. Right, Richard, the reaper squad in those planes, you are ready How to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaper is divided into a dozen teams and flies in all directions. This is obviously to prepare to bypass the deep red kingdom and the turbulent land, to clean up the various creatures that Faro survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West, in the east and in the south, there are hundreds of millions of human beings living. There are tens of millions of intelligent lives of various aliens. With Richard's current strength, even the Crimson Kingdom has no way to defend it completely. It can only defend the key cities, and the escorts will concentrate on the king and wait for transmission to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to think, he understood that this is actually a faceless test, test whether he can really be a mature king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pondered for a while and finally gave his own answer: "With our strength, outside the protection kingdom, we can organize up to a maximum A strong hunting team. So... we should knock out the squad sent by the Reaper one by one. And... give priority to the wreckage and then attack the second detachment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a somewhat cruel but very realistic command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time it takes to ship the wreckage is almost the same as destroying a detachment. If you don't ship the wreckage, you can obviously fight for time and die a lot of people. But if these wrecks are taken back by the reapers, it will not be long before they are a new reaper. So Richard’s command is to exchange time with the reaper for the life of someone other than the deep red kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a disguised mutual consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face does not give his own thoughts, but says: "Okay, I will do it according to this plan! Go now!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard disappeared in the portal, he turned to the wormhole and walked in. After the moment, she came to the No. 1 position from Lanshui Oasis City and walked into a separate camp room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the barracks with mountains and sea, this barbarian girl is engrossed in carving a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone statue looks a bit like Richard, but it is quite rough. The girl's engraver is obviously not very good, and some of them can't control their own strength. One accidentally squeezes the half-carved stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed into the ground with some anger, and the whole camp shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't help Richard." No face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea stood up and frowned and asked, "What should I do? Do you want to kill more reapers?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl has had no trust in faceless since that day. If you encounter something you can't think of, you will come and discuss it with no face. No face will help her as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face said: "Now the nest is in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is just lifting Does Misso share the painful thing? What should I do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face said calmly: “I don’t know. But I know, now only your beast God's blood can completely suppress the soul of the mother's nest. Now the reaper constantly gives control orders to the mother's nest, and the mother's nest has been resisting. But there must be other loopholes in the soul of the mother's nest, such as forcible control, or even erase. Soul. Once the hen's nest is controlled by the reaper, or killed, the consequences are clear to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea are thinking, after a while: "I remembered, Calando does have a secret method... well, I know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faceless but frowning, said: "Tell me, what is the secret law? I also have a method that can play a similar role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea look no Face, calmly said: "But your method will not be very useful, isn't it? If there is no problem, you have already told me what to do, instead of coming to me for discussion."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, this method is not very safe, and the effect may be limited. But this is a solution after all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is what you just said, then my method is obviously more effective. But what is it, that is the secret of the Calando tribe, I can't tell you." The mountain and the sea are abnormal. Calm, not like the girl who used to be unclear in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea stood up, took the cloak and wrapped it on the body, and walked outside the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one took her and asked, "What are you doing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To talk to the mother's nest, we must first understand her situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Nothing, I don’t know why, there is always a kind Strong uneasiness, so refused to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea looked no face, suddenly turned around, close to no face, closed his eyes and smelled it, then whispered: "Good smell "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl suddenly leaned forward and kissed gently on the cheek of the faceless metal mask, then said, "Thank you for telling me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the mountains and the sea strode out of the camp, leaving only no face in the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea trails go to the wormhole, this wormhole was originally only open to Richard, but the mother's nest also knows a few special characters around Richard. No face is one, and mountains and sea are also one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before standing in front of the wormhole, the girl put her hand on the frame of the portal and said softly at the bottom of her heart: "The mother's nest, I am coming to you, and you." Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miraculously, the sounds of mountains and seas rang through the outer body of the wormhole and in the consciousness of the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest immediately replied: "Very happy, the mountain and the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls walking The wormhole, when she came out from the other end, she saw the mother's nest like a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl went to the mother's nest, walked up to it, and then extended her hand. The nest hesitated, then explored the blade and gently placed it on the girl's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest of the mother's nest is a little ridiculous compared to the body. However, compared with the barbarian girl, this blade is wider than the girl. Such a huge and extremely sharp blade, so soft in the hands of the mountains and the sea, did not hurt her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea gently held the blade of the mother's nest, closed his eyes and smelled it, saying: "This is... each other The staggered taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and sea otters have opened their eyes, and the deep shackles seem to contain the whole world. She looked at her mother's nest, and the voice sounded directly in the consciousness of her mother's nest: "I have already felt your pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the mother's nest is very sweet, Very gentle: "The pain can always be tolerated, not to mention the owner to help me share. But I am worried that I will lose my freedom, and once I lose, the owner's help will be lost by half. Even more."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl nodded and said, "Our Carando's secret method can help you and help me. Next, I will show you that we are picking up The fate of the down, are you willing to accept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian girl sent a message, and after the mother’s nest saw it, she immediately said with surprise: "But your Highness! You "How can this be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't care for me, are you willing to accept about your part?" The mountain and the sea asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can accept, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is not yet When I finished, I was interrupted by the mountains and the sea: "Then we will start. I will call the people who are holding the ceremony. At this time tomorrow, we can carry out the ceremony. I need your cooperation, including when necessary.. ....lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
