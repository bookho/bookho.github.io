			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the Hunter and the Holy Builder means that if Li The luck of the inspection is good enough to gather the legendary abilities of the various powerful players. Once the hunter is discovered, naturally everyone will be quicker, and from another perspective, if you can cooperate with the hunter In particular, Richard is also a holy constructor at the same time, and it is also endlessly tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face does not continue to go deep, but faintly said: "Speaking of this is enough, since you have such talent, then follow this path Going on, the legendary powerhouses and gods you will encounter will become more and more in the future, don't waste such good materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not waste Such a good material has no understated understatement, but Richard suddenly burst into a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the face, Richard stood alone in the courtyard for a whole night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules that can perceive the soul fragments, and the traces of seeing the rules, are derived from the true talent. Today, Richard gradually discovers that this is true. Talent is actually giving you the power to see through the essence of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true talents from the beginning to the present, the real talents are evolving according to this route, as the number of uses increases, and Richard’s own strength Growing up, real talent is showing more and more powerful power. Without realism, it is impossible for Richard to pry into the trajectory of the rules when he is so young, and it is impossible to use the wisdom talent to establish an analytical model of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom is the weapon to climb the summit, and reality is the cornerstone of the entire world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the face, at this moment, it is repeated in the heart of Richard, and Richard believes that many powerful and powerful fields can be brought to their side, even Can partially tamper with the faceless rules of the eternal and time dragon game rules, the words will never be untargeted, is this really the best way for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a soul-hunter, one of the most obvious benefits is that Richard’s future magical souls will be endless, and there will be a wide variety of them, within a certain range. The only limitation that controls and influences the type of magical soul generation is the number of Richards who hunted the legendary powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a little expansion of the idea, in addition to the legendary strong, those powerful forces with regular power, such as the star beast, as well as the gods, can be the object of Richard's capture, and Richard also found a let him The fact that I am creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the analysis and research on the rule of the Iron King's soul rule, Richard found that he has made great progress in the control of the basic metal rules, which originally took three years to reach. The basic control of the project is now almost complete, and it only takes a few days. After all, the rule of the soul is to show the metal rules naked in front of Richard. What Richard needs is memory and learning. It is naturally much faster than the analysis, establishment and control process from scratch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this precedent, Richard also knows that other rule fragments must have the same effect, so that as long as the strong presence of hunting is enough, Li The progress of the control of the rule power will be as fast as the legendary Magic Rainbow Bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror power of real talent, then slowly show it, with it, Richard, etc. directly skipped the process of touching the rules, directly into the analysis and The stage of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was dawn, the first line of morning light pierced the darkness, and it was on the face of Richard, and it hurt his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light in the distance is weak, but it cuts the darkness like a sword, but in the blink of an eye, most of the sky is full of glimmers. Bring a new day and new hope to this dark and cold world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the word appeared in Richard’s heart, and he remembered that person, the goddess who went to the dark area, he also I immediately remembered the fragments of the future that I saw, and thought of the vows I had promised. It was desperate to stop this happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha grew a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soul hunter is a destiny that he can’t avoid, then control the fate in his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplely cleaned up the lab, Richard informed the followers in consciousness and let them gather at the Imperial Palace. After so long, Richard’s army has The rest is almost the same, it is time to proceed to the next battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine o'clock in the morning, the followers and the generals of the Principality gathered in a partial temple in the Imperial Palace and began to report to Richard on the situation during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville is already sitting on the throne. He is busy spending most of his time to appease the people, reorganize the army, and plan to rebuild the Throne of the Cold Iron. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Principality of the Principality was entrenched around the Throne of the Cold Iron, and did not leave much force to protect the traffic line from the Principality to the Throne of the Cold Iron. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of reconnaissance beasts all over the empire, and dozens of brains are in turn, and a huge network has long been woven. It is almost impossible to sneak into Richard’s transport force. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the logistics force is commanded by Raymond, for the former opponent of the Joseph family, put a trap in the 珞 位 plane, destroying Gordon and him in one fell swoop Most of the knight's guys, at least there is no problem in their ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard never relaxed the surveillance of Raymond. The real knowledge of the Solomon Scholars Master is too profound, and it is so profound that the conspiracy can be concealed to the invisible. The extent of no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always has an instinct. It seems that Raymond is not as comfortable as he is, as if he has been planning behind, but Raymond is now completely Being controlled by the mother's nest, as long as the mother's nest has an idea, it can directly let him die. As long as Raymond does not want his soul to fall into the hands of Richard's necromancer, it will definitely disappear with the secret method while ** dying. To erase the soul, according to common sense, Raymond has not played any tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei expelled the distracting thoughts and continued to listen to the report, and the line of sight continued to linger on the map of the empire’s territory. At this time, a message made Richard Have an interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grand Duke of Sabalu wants to invite me to his place to feast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dek snorted and glanced dissatisfiedly at the general who was reporting important political affairs. He said: "This little thing has to be mentioned. The cold iron throne has been hit by us. He is a little grandfather and wants to make a head. Going to his territory, forget who he is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at this time: "Wait, this guy dare not come cold at this time." When the Iron Throne meets the new emperor, he invites me to the past. I must have relied on it. I will check his background."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general immediately turned to command the commander, and an imperial official walked into the hall after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With careful questioning, he found that the Sabairu Grand Duke was really not a simple character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the Grand Duke of Subaru is in the northern frontier of the empire, facing the extremely cold zone. His territorial territory is unusually large, with a range of more than 100,000 square kilometers. It is already a big kingdom. Because most of the territory is the permafrost ice sheet and the Gobi, the climate in the southern narrow strip is pleasant. The growth of the local population and the scarcity of immigration have always been a serious injury. His development. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the advantage of the law, the suburbs of Sabalu can still be self-sufficient in food, and his territory is rich in various mineral deposits, especially Known as the Bihan Mithril, these minerals have accumulated huge wealth for the Dagong of all ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Sabalu is a member of the Iron Triangle Empire. In fact, it has always been an independent kingdom, in addition to maintaining regular rituals on the pilgrimage, whether it is military It is still diplomacy, and the influence of the Empire on Subaru is minimal. More importantly, it is said that Dagong and the dragons who have been plagued by the empire for hundreds of years are very close, but even this generation of the Iron Triangle Empire has successively connected Li Shilongtu and The two famous generals of Salenville are still unwilling to tear the face and open the war with Sabairu, thus showing the strength of the great Dabar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragons, is there a dragon?" Richard asked indulgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire official looked very nervous and couldn’t help but reach out and wipe a thin layer of sweat on his forehead and said, "It is said that there is, but no one has ever I have really seen the dragons worshipped by the dragons, but according to the teachings of the madmen, it should be an ancient dragon. It lives in the void and has all kinds of incredible power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the headquarters of the dragon education." Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far, no one knows where these madmen’s headquarters are, they just appear out of thin air, every time they appear A batch, killing is not endless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said: "This is a bit interesting, tell Sabalu, just say me I will be there soon, let him prepare for the reception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
