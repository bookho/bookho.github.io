			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the worm nest is large enough, the half-blood can be hatched once Hundreds, every 10 minutes can hatch a batch, although the life of a half-blooded god is only a short ten hours, but this is enough, the blood of the mother's nest reserves enough to make 4500 half-blood Hey, this is a terrible army. At the crucial moment, you can instantly immerse the enemies in the sea of ​​the 16th-level combat units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information surprised Richard. I didn’t think that the Zonghu actually had such a huge effect, but the number of blood from the mother’s nest Zong Hu has been emptied of at least 1,500 times of blood. No wonder he will become so humble and flattering that he wants to go to Richard's side. Zong Hu is not willing to follow Richard, but just wants to get rid of his mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha swept their position, the two soul nodes of Zonghu and the mother's nest almost overlapped, and there seems to be nothing good, no wonder so rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-blood is really important, but Zonghu has been working hard for Richard since this time, and Richard has to consider his feelings. The information transmitted by the hen's nest was repeated several times, and Richard asked the mother's nest: "How important is Zonghu in your promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The nest firmly answered: "It can affect the probability of success in my promotion. In addition, it may affect the real name that appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is equal to Said that Zonghu is indispensable. After hesitated, Richard said, "If this is the case, then let Zonghu 'help' you for a while, until the completion of the promotion, but you should also pay attention to it. Don't make him too embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest came with a feeling of pleasure, saying: "Master, Zonghu is a god, can not follow normal People look at it, and the more he packs, the more he will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu plugged in again and shouted: "I am not a god. It’s a human being, my soul is still a human being, but the blood of the gods is flowing in the body, very thin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest of the mother makes the Zonghu quiet Down: "Since it is very thin, it is necessary to put a few more blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard once again examined the information of the hen's nest. After such a long time, all the conditions of the tenth order of the promotion were satisfied, and the divinity even had some overflow. This was when Richard was not in Faro, a group of followers. Significant progress has been made in the ancestral highlands, which successively defeated the barbarians' coalition forces and occupied two important temples. The temple contained divine objects, which were naturally shipped to the mother's nest in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother nest has evolved to a considerable extent, and the description of the functions of various parts of the body is as many as hundreds of thousands of words. Possible evolution and improvement direction, then this number needs to be doubled again. If a sub-item is used to adjust the promotion, Richard finds that he needs to make nearly a thousand choices, covering the nest. The nature and frequency of the breath, up to the material of the hind paw. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is now in the chest of the body, hiding a huge brain that is terrifying, the efficiency of its calculation is not much worse than that of Richard, who has seven-order wisdom. Regarding his own promotion, it has long used a lot of time and computing resources, and divided the ten-order promotion direction into three major directions: maternal survival, creation of combat units and maternal diversification, and in each direction. Set up three different reinforcement forces. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all strengthen the maturity of the mother, then the ability to create combat units will not change, and if the weakest one is chosen, then the nest There are still some resources left to create combat units, or to develop more capabilities to strengthen, so if Richard does not want to bother, then skip the details, just choose among the nine options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has indulged in a bit, and originally wanted to reinforce the ability of the Brood to create combat units. This is the core and largest of the Brood in the plane war. The value is there, but when it is time to make a decision, Richard suddenly feels a move and thinks of the doomsday mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a doomsday mark, which means that the reaper will appear on this plane sooner or later. So far, no one can say clearly whether the reaper is What, the doomsday mark and the reaper of destruction, are just things that live in the legend, and all records are not vague as if they were telling a story or from prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the mark from Faro, Richard did not study, so he was taken to the Eternal Dragon Hall by the sand, and so far there is no result, but Richard There is a vague intuition, and the thing he got is probably the true doomsday mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sinking, Richard resolutely chose to maximize the survival of the ancestor ontology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This choice surprised the mother's nest and couldn't help but ask: "Master, this is not necessary, now the strong under the legend, I Not afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need you not even afraid of the legendary strong," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, I am not afraid, half-blood is very fast, and it will fly. If it is just a legend, it can completely kill him." The nest honestly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I need you to fight against a group of legends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this place? A group of legends." The mother's nest is somewhat puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not want to explain it any more. The intuition about the doomsday imprint came entirely from the sixth sense of the magician, which could not be explained by language and logic. On that day, he got the thing, and then the sand was blurted out and the term was imprinted. The intuition suddenly imprinted into his consciousness, and then every time he thought about it, Richard had another intuition, if the last day’s mark appeared. When things spread out, they will come true in a very short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most incredible phenomenon in prophetic magic, and it becomes a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is silent for a moment, suddenly suddenly: "Master, we are not going to start the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard nodded and said, "Almost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is counting fast, saying: "If you fight, you are still preparing for it. Not enough, but you can start the prelude in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is preparation for starting the prelude, but wait for you to advance and say."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered something and said, "Yes, I brought you some power. For the sample of the living body, you send a brain to come back and take it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your master." The mother's nest came with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the knights have all passed the plane portal, and hundreds of Cyclades, who have proved loyal, have begun to transmit. Every knight and step knight carries a lot of supplies for replenishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a box with a volcanic mark on it and walked into the rear of the commanding castle, where the area was specially opened for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years of development, today's Lanshui Oasis City has become a huge city with a registered permanent population of over 200,000. The number of migrants who want to find opportunities is flooding in every day, and these floating populations are more than the resident population with identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Water Oasis has been completely expanded, the huge oasis lake is completely controlled, no longer allowing caravans or rogues to come close, the city center is constantly Reconstruction and expansion, a lively neighborhood may turn into another more prosperous look after half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area where the time lighthouse is located is no longer the edge of the city, but has become the center, and Gangde has drawn a huge area centered on the time lighthouse. Reconstructed a city in the middle of the city, and used it as a crimson grand prince, which is the castle of Richard. The castle has all the facilities and is stationed by the soldiers and the nest combat units brought from Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the castle, the central area of ​​Oasis City is also developing rapidly, with ample supply of water, and a group of low-level mages who smell the smell of gold coins. The environment in the core area is changing almost every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the wide and clean streets, you can see the tall, shady street trees and the manicured lawns. There are exquisite and beautiful buildings. Around the building, there are well-kept gardens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street, you can see a few fully armed knights at any time, walking slowly through the column, which is a timed patrol, these knights are It is the young stepping knight of Richard, who is handsome and tall and looks good. Their duty is to patrol the wealthy Manhattan. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these knights are only about tenth level, they can patrol the cavalry with the tenth-level knight. This kind of big handwriting is also the aristocratic gathering area of ​​several great emperors. It is not common. In addition, the more important of these knights is their identity. They are the direct knights of the mysterious crimson Dagong Richard. If they attack them, they will declare war on the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
