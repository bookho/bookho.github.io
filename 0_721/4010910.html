			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of sacrifice is unremarkable, and Richard brings five A top-level offering also smoothly strengthened the plane channel of Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chose to strengthen it three times in a row until the deck channel was reinforced to the point where only one hundred gold coins were needed to transport a warrior. Only when this intensity is reached, the plane channel will allow the special powerful creature of the hive life tree to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the time limit for the eight times time flow rate of the Greenson plane has been extended for thirty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other graces, Richard used to redeem two small lord-level core materials, and also got a few pieces of quasi-legendary equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the list of gods, Richard saw a lot of five-stage design drawings, including three in the magical suit, and in the 骑士è Knight series. Two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since Richard has the ability to hunter, there is no need for the design of the fifth-order construction. In his eyes, the magical suits and 绯sè riders are just more powerful. Compared with their own compositions that copy the magical soul, xìng can be improved, but the cost and time spent are more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the money earned by Richard’s sale of a magical suit is similar to that of the magical soul, but it takes three times. more than. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in terms of high-end combat power, Richard does not lack the structure, the lack of the legendary level of equipment. If the followers are able to match this level of equipment, then the worst will also approach the heavenly sanctuary, strong like Tiramisu, water, 绯sè and Zonghu, can fight against ordinary legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, this sacrifice Richard got what he wanted, but there was no extra surprise, it was a good rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the Eternal Dragon Hall, the attitudes of the great priests suddenly became a lot of enthusiasm. It was a complete transformation, and there was a tendency to climb to Richard’s bed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky great priest who presided over the sacrifice was even more prosperous, very reluctant, and implicitly hinted that he would definitely find a way to return to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard’s sacrifice, the wave is five top-level offerings, which is a rare big deal in recent years. The great priests then understood why Richard was able to kill a chief priest in such an understatement. This young sacred architect is not lacking in sacrifice at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation between the chief priest and Richard, now seems to be a joke, able to strip off the two cobweb patterns on Richard’s hourglass She is already a very good record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other great priests have long let go of their restraints and desperately want to leave a little impression on Richard. As long as he orders himself next time, they can really fight for 30 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not entangle with these over-enthusiastic priests, leaving the Eternal Dragon Hall directly to the Prince of Tumen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, the eyes of the great priests were concentrated on the lucky one who was still immersed in happiness, and they speculated that Richard had taken a fancy to her. Which point. White, long legs, big chest, or fart / hips? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned, Prince Tumen had already waited for him in the study. After he was seated, Prince Tumen asked: "Is the sacrifice today still smooth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Five top festivals Goods, how can you get what you want without success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five top-level offerings...have to admit, holy The mentor is really embarrassing!" Prince Tumen did not hide his surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing, there are more sacrifices, aren't you going to use your channel? But your channel doesn't seem to work very well!" Here, Richard’s gaze began to become sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple are so arrogant and arrogant, and they will never use their arrogance on the head of the Tumen. This can only show that the Prince of Tumen secretly greeted them and allowed them to come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Richard’s blame, the Prince of Tumen did not panic and smiled and said: “I heard that you are the title of Eternal and Time Dragon. And the title is very high. As the title owner, you will never be bullied by the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to test the power of my title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What good is this for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen personally poured a cup of tea into Richard and smiled and said: "The advantage is that I confirm the title is It is worth having. Although it is difficult to get the desired grace with my current strength, a large number of sacrifices are still necessary and valuable. The title can only be obtained by a large number of sacrifices, and the number of sacrifices is up, the title Naturally, it seems that it is not a good deal to transfer the sacrifices to other families."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen said most of it The situation faced by the strong and the giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s a strong individual or a giant of the whole, it’s gradually going to happen when you sacrifice, the stronger you are, the less you get yourself. What you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the giants also intentionally let some weak families to sacrifice for themselves, to see if they can harvest anything special. But the end result is that God's grace falls on the family that replaces the sacrifice. The giants are completely bloodless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a lot of things, people find that it is impossible to drill the eternal and timeless dragon. Everything they can think of, the Eternal and the Dragon of Time can think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, people have also found that as long as they have done a lot of things, even if it is a small movement, then the future graceful harvest will quietly decline. This is not to say that the total amount of God's grace is falling, but that it is even more difficult to get the necessary grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme example is that a warrior goes to sacrifice and is finally solidified with a spell-accelerated super-magic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many wealthy and strong people choose to sell sacrifices in the end. The gains obtained in this way are much stronger than the gambling luck on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after seeing the powerful power of Richard’s senior title, Prince Tumen finally realized the meaning of insisting on sacrifice. The Eternal and Time Dragon will not be taken advantage of, but it will not be lost for no reason. As long as you pay, you will have a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen did have a huge harvest. There is such an understanding. With his strong strength and family background, it is not difficult to get a sacrifice. Maybe in the near future, the Prince will become a title owner. But from Richard's point of view, this is not a happy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Prince of Tumen and said faintly: "His Royal Highness, in order to let you get such a conclusion, I erased all the gods of the chief priest." Well, there are dozens of shrines of the Knights of the Temple. You know the fairness of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, how much grace I have erased, how much God I have to pay. It seems not so pleasant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not my intention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is your subordinate is too stupid." I understand that you are wrong." Richard did not give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen smiled and said, "But your handling is really too intense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and admitted: "Really, I think so. In fact, the next time I should use my fist to hit the woman's face, it is more enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen’s mouth was open, and the smile on his face seemed a little embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he or the chief priest, to the present position, decent and dignity are sometimes more important than interests. As the chief priest's identity and heart, if Richard is smashed in front of everyone, it is better to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you really... very decisive." Prince Tumen did not know what to say, he thought about it and said "This way, I really have a bad thought about this time. As compensation, I will build a fortress in the Ashan collar and station the army for 30,000. After one year, the fortress will be handed over to Archimonde, how do you see it? I think this should help the current situation in Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen cannot be unclear The current trend of the sacred dynasty, he did so, in fact, is to protect the security of Archimonde for one year in his own status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of this fortress can be specified by Richard. Whoever attacks the fortress is equivalent to attacking the Prince of Tumen. If Richard proposed to build the fortress on the border, it would block the march of the sacred dynasty army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or change the conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s refusal made the Prince of Tumen very surprised. He took a deep look at Richard and said slowly: "It seems that many people underestimate Archimonde!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has always been like this Richard said lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you need? Equipment, materials, territory, or the army, the plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you can, I want to see your material library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Tumen thought for a moment and nodded: "Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the son of the Garan Emperor, the collection of the Prince of Tumen is extremely rich in nature, and he has no secrets and has completely opened his own treasure house to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking into the huge treasure house of this palace, Lichao thought that he saw the list of gods provided by the Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the double-headed dragon, the snake head of the five snake lizards, the complete Chimera specimen...each is the core material of the small lord level . In terms of minerals, the various elements of the lord have the heart, and actually have enough three sets. The wonderful metal that can absorb the magic growth on its own, the liquid minerals that can change the shape at will and have their own consciousness, also let Richard open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard chose a tree of life tree as a compensation for the spirit of the empire. In addition, he also bought three snake heads of five snake lizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Carando continent was in the past, Richard had eaten the egg of the snake lizard and was extremely impressed with its horrific ability to regenerate. The blood of the multi-headed snake lizard is also one of the top bloodlines of Noland. When this creature breaks through, it will have a snake head. Six snake lizards are already close to the level of the big lord, and it is said that in the depths of the plane, there is a seven-snake lizard named Xudela, whose horror is even above the abyss lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these three snakeheads, Richard paid two top sacrifices as a price. This is a fair and reasonable price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reason why the Prince of Tumen was so happy to open his collection, the purpose is to find out the sacrifices in the hands of Richard. It can be seen that his title for the Eternal and Time Dragon is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
