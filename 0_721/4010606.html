			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, dotted with dozens of stars, small and small, small It’s just a flash of light, but the big one takes up a whole third of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magnificent scene shows that Richard was lost for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the earth suddenly trembled, and an earth-shattering roar came, just like a bang in the ear of Richard’s ear, Richard stunned When the bangs looked around, they only saw a sudden glare. At one time, Richard’s vision was white, and no other could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling, something in the glare flew over to Richard, as if it were a person, Richard reached out with lightning The tactile sensation immediately confirmed that it was indeed an individual, and it was a very powerful person. It was just that the whole body was up and down, and it was obviously not hurt. Richard remembered that there were no human beings in the population of the Jinjin Valley, and there was no human being. Biology, then most of the people who flew over were warriors who had been wounded. Richard’s hand immediately led the way, and with great precision, he eliminated the huge impulse of the man and gently placed him behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s whole body energy was running, his vision had recovered, but when he saw the scene again, he saw a huge incomparable tomahawk flying. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked, the lightning slammed, the big axe flew past his scalp, and the terror power attached to the giant axe exuded High heat, burned Richard's hair to a small half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, Richard’s cold sweat came down, and the Golden Valley was too dangerous. He was shot when he went to Greenson. Now that the fighting power has risen sharply, and through the tempering of the absolute battlefield, the result is that it is almost shackled by a golden valley. If it is really careless, it will be seriously injured by this huge axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge axe is surprisingly good. An axe is just two meters square. It is more exaggerated than the weapon used by the ogre. Richard looks up. Seeing the battlefield is not far away, there are three giants of more than ten meters, screaming like thunder, killing with hundreds of human warriors, one of the giants is less than a hundred meters away from Richard, now with his hands empty, look The big axe that came to him was thrown by him. The three giants only looked at their size, and they knew how to be powerful. When they waved their legs, there were always several human warriors who were beaten and flew out. Some soldiers were directly The air is squirting blood, and obviously can't keep his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the human warriors are well-trained and extremely elite. They hold heavy-duty rifles and are crowded at the feet of giants. A gun is constantly piercing into the feet and calves of giants. Each gun will leave a blood hole. The giant is rough and strong. The skin has no blocking effect at all. The more powerful soldiers simply climb the giant body from behind, and the short knife in their hands will cut a piece of meat on the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant has been bruised and bruised, and has been continually retreating, but the human warrior surrounding his feet is like a thorny thorn, let him When the struggle was difficult, the giant was so mad that he suddenly lifted his right foot and stepped on it. Once the feet of several meters long were practical, the human warriors below would indeed be trampled into meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers under the big feet can’t hide, they have cocked their rifles, put the handles on the ground, and set the tower shield on the ground, the whole person As far as possible, the giant was stepping on it, as if stepping on the nail plate, dozens of lances all pierced into the soles of the feet until there was no handle, and even a few of them were worn from the instep, and the giants screamed loudly. Oh, I can't stand, I fell down, but the place where he stepped on, I saw a piece of flesh and blood under the twisted tower shield. More than a dozen soldiers were trampled to death. After the giant fell, no matter how hard they struggled, they couldn’t climb. When he got up, he made a fierce attack, grabbed a few soldiers and stuffed them into his mouth, and swallowed it alive, but his ribs were also pierced by countless rifles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant screamed, struggled a few times, finally did not move, and the blood flowed into the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant who was closest to Richard, after throwing a huge axe in his hand, fell into a frenzy, waving his fists and beating him. Sometimes, kneeling, punching heavily on the ground, every time the giant boxing falls, it will sound like a berry being pinched under the boxing. In heavy boxing, the soldiers will change instantly without wearing thick armor. Into a discus, these soldiers are well-trained, as if they can't hide, they will immediately erect a shield and give the giant the greatest damage. The giant has only smashed a few times, and the fists are bloody. More than a dozen thorn guns were inserted in a dense manner, and he was so angry that he roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sharp and saw two blood lines in the eyes of the giant, apparently already paralyzed, so that he suddenly became mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer screamed and ordered more than a dozen powerful fighters to rush out and quickly throw a spear at the back of the giant. Up to two meters, the first half is covered with barbs, and the tail of the spear is connected with a long chain. The spears shine with a faint scent of light. Apparently these pitchers are all elites above the 14th level, throwing them all out. The spear is extremely powerful, and it is easy to break the skin of the giant's thick skin like a skin, and it has no handle until it is nailed to the bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the giants have been stunned, and they do not know how to avoid them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spearman will chain up and hung up, hundreds of fighters swarmed up, every seven or eight people picked up a chain, screamed and slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant made an earth-shattering roar, but resisted the drag of the hundred soldiers, and the huge body of fifteen meters high fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer screamed: "It’s all gone, let me come." Just jump on the chest of the giant, and the knife in the hand flashes, the giant’s throat is thoroughly Cut open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood spewed out and splashed the officer, but the giant’s hands were caught, and the officer was caught in his hand, slamming into the mouth, 嘎嘎吱I chewed it up, and every time I move, the blood will spurt out of the throat. The giant does not chew a few times, and the head will be stunned and will not move any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting, but for a moment, Richard has seen that the giants’ lives are quite tenacious, and the counterattack before dying is even more deadly. The officer obviously knows the last thing. The one-shot person is not spared, so he is on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last giant snorted again and again, turned around and ran, and the surrounding soldiers took the opportunity to insert more than a dozen long guns on him, but the giants were thick and thick. Forced to squeeze out the heavy infantry in a row, striding away, the giants are long and long legs, striding, and they have already gone in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the battle of a moment is fierce, and it seems that Richard almost held his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axiris then walked out of the portal and immediately exclaimed: "How do you do this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who flew from the battlefield and was gently placed on the ground by Richard, was the thief who was guarding the valley of the Golden Valley with Achilles. The inconspicuous guy looked awful and unbearable. His chest collapsed unnaturally, his face was full of blood, one eye burst open and the other was tightly closed. Richard did not expect him to be so injured. According to the perception, the vitality of Han Erdong is still strong and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris lingered in the cold winter, opened the dark sacred script in his hand, and directly tore off several verses from the inside, those ancient pages were immediately Achilles burned in his hands and accumulated the power of healing that he did not know for many years. He poured into the body of the cold winter, and the body of the cold winter made a squeaky sound. The depressed chest began to recover, and the flesh and blood was blurred. It also stopped bleeding, and new granules grew, sealing the wounds. Even the empty eye frame began to grow granulation, but not long after, the speed of the cold winter recovery was greatly slowed down, obviously those pages The energy burned by the scriptures has been consumed almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
