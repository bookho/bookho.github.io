			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the small hole in the ground, Richard’s face is naturally ugly and ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden smirk came from the side, and Li turned and glared, seeing the water splashing in a panic, not letting him see his face. . But just looking at her constantly swaying shoulders, I can see how hard it is to endure this smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked annoyed and hadn’t had time to curse anything. The seven or eight pharmacy bottles were thrown over. He confessed to drinking all these healing agents, and then sat down to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong people in the vicinity can't help but smile, but there is an unconcealed admiration in the eyes of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the critical moments of the battle, especially when Richard was seriously injured, they also enjoyed the bonus of the King of the Faceless War. The ultimate strength of the instant outbreak really made them deeply obsessed, but also paid a painful price. The price of the soaring level is that the consumption is also increased, and the weak period after the disappearance of the ability can be tortured to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an indescribable weakness and lack of space. Every bone is constantly itching, itching makes people want to poke themselves a few knives. This kind of thing happened to the Iron Shield. His ability to use the King of War was excessive. Therefore, the period of weakness was particularly painful. As a result, he even made a dozen knives, which forced him to endure the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for destroying the projection, it is Richard’s patent. This ability is too dangerous even if it is a blessing on the legendary powerhouse. If the legendary powerhouse can't control it and launch an attack that is too powerful, it is possible to drain itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Sanctuary, only the strongest can enjoy the war madness. No parallels like Romne can enjoy anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich now has to use a faceless destruction projection in every battle, and he naturally inevitably has a weak period. But in the weak period, Richard can't just rest like other strong people. He also needs to take medicine to recover, but also to meditate, but also use the blue fire to refine the reaper of the reaper. This kind of inhuman willpower makes the strong people have nothing to say except for admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face seems to have a soft spot for Richard, and he is particularly fierce, and he is not willing to leave him for five minutes of sleep. And her threats are also effective, as long as the sword is out, both men and women will subconsciously clamp the hips/parts. In the past, the famous stunt of the water flower was carried forward in the faceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes, Richard completed the whole process of refining the remnants of the relics from the meditation, and then the people returned to the kingdom, where they put down the harvesting power metal, replenished the replenishment, and then set off to intercept another. Reaper squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you fight, you will return to the king, and it is also an insurance strategy to prevent the reaper from taking the opportunity to attack the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mother’s nest believes that the reaper will not do this, because for them the king of the deep red kingdom is now worthless, and so many civilians are just The raw materials of the flesh-and-blood warriors. It is not only humans that can be used as raw materials, but all living creatures can. On the number of lives, the ocean can be much more than the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard does not allow the king to lose, the millions of people still living there, and the nest of the turbulent land, is his war. significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Lanshui Oasis City, Richard saw two unexpected guests: Asa and Goshawk. When he saw them, Richard was extremely surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here to participate in the battle of points." Goshawk smiled and gave reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s brain was a bit slow: “Which integral battlefield, dragon or abyss?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Faro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faro? Oh, yes, and Faro!" Richard didn't react at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Faro’s point battlefield is already in vain, even if there are three exclusive artifacts as attractions, there is no strong one to come over. As a result, Richard almost forgot that Faro was also one of the points battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enlightened Li looked at the Goshawk and Asa, and his complex face: "Do you really want to go to Faro to fight? Always give me a reason to say it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is a super strong, Goshawk has a black hair at the moment, and even the strength of Richard is somewhat invisible. Even if he does not reach the super realm, he should not be far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two strong players to join, and the victory over the Reaper will increase a lot. However, such a strong person, even if there is demand, there is no special reason, and it is not dangerous to accompany Richard. For example, the Star Sage is willing to take responsibility for the safety of the other two points in the battlefield, but will not take part in the battle of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the reaper, the superpower is also at risk of falling. If Richard does not have wisdom and real talent, he can control the variables to the lowest level, and he does not dare to fight on the wire every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God eagle smiled and said: "I came for knowledge. The secret behind the reaper hides the essence of the world, and only here can get enough There are many clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha doubles and accepts, slowly said: "Someone gave me a clue that you are a university-level scholar mage. As far as I know, college students are the highest level of scholars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk calmly said: "I know that you are all the scholars of the Master. I am in the past It is indeed a scholar's mage, and is regarded as the next generation of castle masters. But I have left Solomon Castle and become a free man. My desire for knowledge is no different from your thirst for power." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha did not relax and ask: "Why are you out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa Cold, heavy snoring, and went to Richard when he was murderous. And Richard smiled indifferently, his body suddenly burst into a thick blood, and swallowed Asa's murderousness in one bite, and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is in a stunned color, she did not think that the hidden killing and destruction consciousness in Richard has actually become so rich! How many killings will this accumulate so rich and murderous, and how old is Richard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a murderous fight, Asa has been defeated. Other forces, regardless of combat experience, Richard has far surpassed Asa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk saw the competition between the two superpowers in his eyes, reached out and shot in Asa’s hand, preventing her further movements, then Said to Richard: "I understand why you are so hated and vigilant to the scholar mages. Even if I am, I can't prevent them. Of course, I have to deal with them, they can't stand it. Ok, I am detached. The reason for Solomon Castle is that I have found a more important and meaningful goal than to pursue the ultimate in the world, that is Asa.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Goshawk Looking at Asa, the gentle moment in his eyes melted the invincible warrior of the Great Snow Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two openly showful acts of love, Richard is quite speechless. But it must be admitted that with their participation, Richard’s actions in Faro are extremely beneficial. It is this pair that can be used to kill the reaper's squad without any assistance. What Richard needs to give to them is nothing more than a messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to see the mountains and the sea? She is now in a turbulent place, and can be reached instantly through the wormhole."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa shook his head and said, "No. There are opportunities in the future. I will help you solve these reapers first, but what do you need to pay attention to?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of things." Richard thought for a moment and said, "This way, the next interception will soon start. This time we will act together, you should be able to see the reaper Strength, then you can act alone. If you need any replenishment, you can do it directly to the Quartermaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa suddenly said: "I heard that there are three pieces in the battlefield of Faro." Exclusive artifacts?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and said, “Yes. But they have already entered the points system and have set the exchange price. But if If you need an artifact, I still have it in my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk’s eyebrows rise, obviously Surprised, said: "There are five artifacts in the redemption system. There are other artifacts in your hand. Are you not a god builder or an artifact craftsman?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed: "The most artifacts here are not me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, no face change A pose, an elegant shape, and then the body shines brightly, the various artifacts are intertwined with light, and there are curtains like halos and rainbows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this, even Asa and Goshawk were shocked to stand up. Because they actually saw the running runes in the halo! Because of the power of too strong and the emergence of the gods runes in the light of the bloom, how much should this artifact be so powerful? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are more than one artifact that can release Rune Guanghua! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no face and a dignified atmosphere, the artifact is gradually fading away. But Asa and Goshawk see her eyes are completely different. This faceless is simply a mobile treasure house, it seems that the whole body is an artifact, and there is no low-level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk and Asa looked at each other and the eagle smiled and said: "Well, Richard, I have to admit, you really surprised me. But we have already seen the list, the three artifacts for us two They are very useful, just redeem it. As for the points, we have prepared some things to redeem points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawks handed over a barbarian-style backpack, inside Put dozens of things in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard took out the first piece, his heart jumped. This is a star-shaped iron, which is one of the necessary materials for making space-type equipment because of its natural space rules. Just the size of this piece of iron, you can redeem points for more than 200 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other ancient beast bone, actually contains the spirituality of the ancient beast! This ancient beast bone can extract the magical soul and is the main material of the fifth-order structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the talent of the Hunter, you can extract the spiritual integrity from the ancient animal bones, and then create countless but slightly weak magic souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Richard saw seven or eight pieces of spiritual material. Each piece of material means a series of fifth-order configurations. In addition to the materials, there are some special herbs and minerals, which are very rare. As for the use, Richard is not good at pharmacy and alchemy, so it is not quite sure. But the value of the city is identifiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard picks up a ruby-like material, it is instantly attracted by the incomparably ancient, but incomparable will. If you look carefully, you can see the illusion of countless fierce beasts in this gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps: Thanks to the new ally, the dusty, radiant, and sunglowweng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 120,000 words planned for January were successfully completed. This is the character of you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Spring Festival, everyone rests and relaxes, and every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still about 200,000 words in the whole book, the vast green continent, the bottomless abyss, the dark areas, the dark side of the world, one will not be less! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the Lantern Festival began to erupt until the finale, if the pass live singing "until the end of the world", does not rule out the early outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
