It doesn't matter, there is me. I can design a structure so that she can see you when I see you, and what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is so angry and funny, is there such a thing? Nature expresses no faith. Controlling the human heart, even the church does not guarantee 100% success for its followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence said proudly: "The kid, in the world of construction, you are really tender! When I was young, how many beautiful girls were there?" After my construction, I never dare to see me again? Hey! It’s just that this kind of thing is much more done. It’s inevitable that there will be a soft fit for the girl who shouldn’t touch it, then Hey, I have to come to the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lawrence's lasciviousness, Richard is speechless. This old man is obviously so natural, or else he will not study the so-called soft structure. Although the old man looked at himself with an eye, you asked me what I was, but Richard did not have any interest in the magical structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying in the day and staying for a day, confirming that the white night body is innocent, Richard will give all the harvest on the road to Lawrence, quietly One person left the capital of the day and stepped into the portal of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time of Noland, Richard only left for a few days, but Akmon’s floating island was obviously a lot more lively. In just one morning, three people came to visit the archipelago of Archimonde and asked about the appointment to participate in a private auction two months later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took all these things to the old butler, but a brand new application made Richard interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying from a small family called Nelson, this is just a traditional count. The lord got a low-level offering and wanted to sacrifice to the Eternal Dragon Temple, so he applied for the sacrifice to the Archimonde family and mentioned the voluntary contribution of 40,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with a low-level offering, 40,000 gold coins are less than 10% of the total value. But this is the first time that Richard has seen such a request, so he called the old housekeeper and asked him carefully. This means that it is generally necessary to pay about 20% of the 'channel fee' through the floating island giants. The little Earl’s economic situation seems to be average, so he is ready to take the path of Archimonde to see if it can be cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler’s suggestion is to charge at least 15%. If it is low, it may become a public enemy of the floating island. This is a customary rule. There are not enough benefits. It is meaningless to challenge it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "Okay, it will be charged at 15%. But this price lasts only three months, and it rises after three months." Go back to the 20% channel fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With everything in place, Richard left the floating island and went to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has been waiting here, he brought in five million magic materials. This mortgage is the equivalent of the future of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon is also here, he is ready for the twenty candidate knights that Richard needs, and one hundred up to thirteen Step by step knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, both Nyris and Agamemnon discovered that Richard’s mood was a bit dark, especially when Richard saw Agamemnon, his face seemed to be even darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich! What happened to you?" Nyris asked in surprise. In his impression, Richard seems to be always very cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and tried to expel the image of the white bed lying on the bed from the heart, and squeezed a smile and said, "I am fine, not quite Okay? You see, my strength is expanding very fast now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris nodded and said, "Yes, you are ready to take back Is there any difficulty in the idea of ​​the Black Rose Castle? If necessary, I can help you find a few Sanctuary to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head and said, "Reassured, how can I not even pick up a bunch of clowns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are in a bad mood, Richard." Agamemnon Suddenly, he stared at Richard and asked: "Is it related to me? No, is it white night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated and finally ordered. Nod, said: "She is very hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon frowned, only after a moment asked: "Can she fight?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha nodded: "It should not be shadowed It’s just a long time to recover, and it’s just a matter of luck.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon said directly: “That’s it. If she can’t Fighting, it’s better to die. At the latest, one year, I have to go to the absolute battlefield!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Me too!” said Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Richard is somewhat puzzled. They are all people with great prospects. Why should they take risks on the battlefield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only those who have experienced the battlefield can truly be called the strong!" Nyris said with a longing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is a little weird. So, isn’t he already a half-powerful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought the newly acquired warrior, bid farewell to the two allies, and entered Faro. He also has a sense of urgency now, because the sanctuary of the temple on the floating island is coming to an end soon. At that time, the various people may be ready to move again. However, after coming out of the battlefield, Richard looked forward to the arrival of this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro’s everything is calm, but the Sequoia Kingdom is not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the inspiration of Richard, Gangde is extremely tough on the one hand, but all the army of the kingdom aristocracy wants to enter the blood-stained area, all intercepted, do not listen Advice will start. On the other hand, Gangde tried to avoid killing the aristocratic army. After the arrest, he also handled it according to the rules of the aristocrats. He ate and ate deliciously, and then let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, although the kingdom nobility never dared to enter the bloody land, but in their traditional battlefield, the noble House of Lords, but more and more Active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opening day of each House, several nobles jumped out and accused Richard of jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the main reason is that after the end of the intruder, Richard himself and his close allies are greatly damaged, and the loss even exceeds those who stand on the royal side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal expeditionary army was completely shackled, but only 10,000 people, the death of the Crown Prince is a huge loss, but the royal family has other heirs. And Richard has a bloody battle, more than 50,000 deaths and injuries! The most important thing is that Richard’s lord, the Duke of the Wolf, died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the minds of many nobles, it is felt that the contrast between the royal family and Richard has quietly changed. The benefits of the blood-stained land are too great, and the huge 25% share of Richard's will make people's eyes go crazy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as Gangde and Io almost annihilated all uncontrolled horses and slaves, the caravan’s advancement speed was greatly improved, and the guards Power has also been cut by more than two-thirds. As a result, the trade profit with the dwarf country was immediately doubled. This cake is already big enough to make people lose their senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every day, there are always a few nobles jumping on the podium, screaming and screaming that the bloody land should belong to the entire Sequoia Kingdom, Richard is only How can a small viscount occupy more land than the entire Sequoia kingdom? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in the process of their roaring, Richard’s fact of laying down the entire bloody land as a knight is naturally neglected. Anyway, it is impossible for Richard to come up with a confirmation letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these people are so eagerly appealing, and no one cares about their clamour for war with Richard. Although the aristocrats sometimes get excited, they will not lose their sense of reason in the real big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more people who are louder in the House, the fewer soldiers there are, and even hundreds of old, weak, and sick people can't get together. As far as this is concerned, it is not enough for the few perverted followers of Richard's men to kill them. It is very doubtful. I want to fight with Richard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles, though they are eager to see the huge interests of the hands, but they still hope to get a new solution in a peaceful and elegant way. Why can we solve the problem that can be solved at the negotiating table? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many nobles in the kingdom have experienced the thrilling bloody battles of Richard and the invaders. The invaders’ killing power is completely beyond the wildest of the nobility. Imagination. At that moment, the filmed Faro warriors rushed to the battlefield, and then they were killed by the invaders. Some people were even smashed into two pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Richard’s squadrons were dispatched, they were able to entangle the invaders, and even the elite team had a slight advantage. As for the last riding of Richard, it is even more turbulent. Who ever thought about the grand scene of the thirty Faro Sanctuary forces charging together? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one day, the taste of the House of Lords began to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a very young aristocrat with messy hair, pale face, and thin body, and when he stood on the podium, it still appeared Very nervous, even afraid to look at the audience under the audience, the voice is also dry. He even took out a stack of thick manuscript paper to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his clown-like look, the original audience was snoring, but with his screaming voice, the House of Lords gradually calmed down. Aristocrats, look at me, I look at you, my face shows horror and ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
