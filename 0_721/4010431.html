He screamed and jumped up, his face was extremely panic, and Cangjie glanced at the store. Let's see what evil characters are in the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw that I was standing in front of Richard, St. Lawrence was a glimpse first, and then I looked quite strange and asked: "Dakso Das Didn't go into the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence immediately gave a long breath, and he immediately remembered that he had just looked awkward, suddenly his face was red, and he put on a fierce expression and stared at Richard. Anger said: "Don't that murderous thing was made out by you, you are a little rabbit, and you are afraid to scare me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrily smiled apologetically, saying : "Just did a life, the whole person has not recovered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden white-night voice inside: "Life "Where, where are you, give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton was shocked and immediately rejoiced: "White night, why are you there too?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get in." White night said inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Lawrence walked inward, but Richard suddenly remembered something, and suddenly he jumped in his heart, pulling St. Lawrence and lowering his voice. Dao: "Wait a minute, the bear's first warlord's ** is not you bought it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What bears the first warlord's **." Lawrence looked Awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he is, the more helpless Richard is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the white night and the old man is special, Richard knows, but if Lawrence uses his own hunted bear’s first superintendent to take medicine, he successfully made a white night. At that time, who knows whether White Night will be angered, she will not be the one who distinguishes the right and wrong, so that Richard is actually sold to the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard had repeatedly questioned, Lawrence showed a mysterious smile and whispered: "I have never seen the squad of the bear chief, and I have never bought it. You should think about it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, thinking about what, Richard is confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sky, the white night is sitting on a broken chair, legs are high on a square table in front, holding a cup in his hand Blood-like red wine is slowly drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only wore a pair of hip short pants all over her body, but the upper body was almost covered with bandages, and there was a huge huge wound on the calf, deep The pale leg bones were exposed, and the wound was still faintly black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night looked at Richard with almost colorless eyes, could not help but shake the red wine in his hand, the scarlet liquid is as thick as blood, in the cup The wall was smashed into various patterns, and one had to wonder if the cup was filled with blood or wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night saw Richard, the pupils shrank, and Richard immediately felt that several parts of his body were like acupuncture, and he wanted to make some action involuntarily. The heart was shocked, and I couldn’t think about it. I instinctively expressed the Tao Tao’s killings accumulated in many life-threatening enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a tangible murderous, but an invisible killing competition, there is no wind in the room, but the temperature is plummeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha swayed, his eyes had a short-lived glow, and then he returned to normal. White nights seemed to have no change, but the blood stains on her bandages It is slowly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a groaning noise in the room, and St. Lawrence fell to the sky and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is now very ordinary, white night and Richard are fighting for the killing, but he is suffering from the pool fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night and Licha face each other, Richard quickly put the old man up, found a chair to put in, remake two times, and then vigorously on his chest back Stroking, let him slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing that Licha was busy in the night, he only got a little bit and said, "Richard, yes, it seems that the killing is a bit more recently."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can get a white night to praise "a lot of killing", and Richard really deserves to be proud. He asked the old man who had finally opened his eyes to shoot the back and asked: "Are you not in the rising place of the rising sun? How come suddenly? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two super-powers of Dakso Das, and two legends and Philip and his two The name guards confronted each other. For the time being, no one can help. The superpowers’ battles are too wide. There is no place where I can intervene. I still stay there. Many people have tried to return to the other three legions of the fortress. I suspected that I was in trouble and I came back directly from the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White nights are understated, but Richard knows that people in Dakso Das are like locusts. In the case of sweeping the entire dusk, you have to go directly back to the sun and the capital from the battlefield. You have to break through the blockade of many enemies. If you don’t say anything else, just look at the injuries on the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a madman." Richard couldn't think of a better adjective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just like each other, you don’t do it with a good sect, you have to go to the battlefield to find death, and how much better than me.” It is also said that although Richard was recruited, the royal family’s original intention was to ask him to give priority to serving the warlord in the dusk, just like another royalist Lu Nuo who was also recruited. The place where he and his studio work is still in Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a reason." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night faint smile: "I have reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will drink a glass of red wine End, reach out to Richard and say: "Get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Life is extinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence next to it suddenly coughed a few times, so Richard frowned, glanced up and down the body of the white night, said: "You The body is too bad to be able to hold more lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For another reason, I don't like to listen to this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the eye, Richard saw that Lawrence had drawn a symbol of a gold coin, and he couldn’t help but move. He said faintly: “One for ten million, you have to pay immediately.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This white night face has become a bit ugly, said: "First owe, wait for the Dax Sodas to return you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard shrugged and said: "The life is absolutely owed first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night light and colorless eyebrows almost locked together, suddenly on Li Inspected: "No, why can you load four lives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I am strong." Said, Richard stood up Pulling on the shirt, the micro-capacity, the muscles of the body are bulging, showing almost perfect lines. Just look at the body shape of his upper body, although it is far from being comparable to the powerful high-ranking warriors, but not like the traditional The legal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaben was fed in the dark blue, and he ate the eggs of the Hydra and the emperor’s meal, and the body was stronger. It is not a level with the ordinary big magician. It is not difficult to carry life with such a strong vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this time, there was a rather embarrassing thing. When Richard was so hard, the cockroach suddenly bounced up, and it was strong and strong. The pen is quite like a gun. Looking at the frame, it is almost necessary to break the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night, Licha was shocked, but Lawrence was a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bear first overseer." White night immediately thought of the reason, some strangely glanced at Richard, then immediately remembered something, said to Lawrence: "Old man, It must be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never seen any of the bears’ superintendents, or they will let you go." Lawrence seems to want Screamed like a rape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night and Richard no longer care about Lawrence, but sit down and talk about the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, Marshal Lundstedt and two other legendary powers have frequently dispatched to the strong people scattered around the sun. Retrieving the Legion Fortress, the plane channel that belongs to the royal family on the side of the floating world also modified the transmission rules, and sent the strongman of Noland to the dusk land directly to the capital of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few days, the long-lasting glory of the ancestors of the eternal dragons will be completed. At that time, all the strong will withdraw to the sun and the capital, relying on the power of the city and the squad to resist the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real war will only begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night swaying the empty glass, saying: "I am going to move a house and put the residence in the gate area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy?" The first thing that jumped up was Lawrence, and the old man was so excited that he was flushed and shouted: "The dog scorpions of Dakso Das are not entering." The city can see us, so how can I sleep later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going, you can stay here." White night said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lawrence's shop is in the upper area of ​​the city, close to the Eternal Dragon Hall, if the Dakso Das people can get here, then the whole It is not far from the fall of the Legion Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the city defense gate and the lower city are different. According to the established strategy, there is the main battlefield of the future, especially the city defense zone, which is the first line. position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sat back again and angered: "You are a conscience guy, how important is an old man’s sleep, you know, but I am also I am used to the screams of the rabbit scorpions, I have adapted, and there is nothing in the past, but you remember to me, if something is broken in the store, I will remember your account."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night is surprised: "Old man, you really want to go, it will be really dead, I will not have the spare time to take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have been through the battlefield for so many years. Don't you still live well? Don't worry, I won't die until I get your people." When it comes to the body of the white night, the old man becomes full. Red light, and courage multiplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night shrugged and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard said: "You are really ready to move over, well, let's be a neighbor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night eyebrows raised, said: "For you, making the construction is more important to the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
