Breathing, and constantly increasing, has been rushed to the sixth level to stop, pale gold shines out of the body, lingering around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of letting the sands shake their heads and shocking Cass. Richard was also a bit surprised. At the beginning of the third grade, Ma Wenzhao jumped directly to the sixth level. Kas had five grades and the result was only six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass did not know that the two were very dissatisfied with their promotion. He even had some surprises at this time, and did not think of burning power. After that, I can still grow to the sixth level of the pastor level! This shows how powerful the new god is, at least it should be a powerful god in the same line as Xerxes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the powerful god of the entire Faro plane is only three. If Kas is hard enough, the theology can be more profound, and it will immediately be found to accept perfusion. Divine power does not belong to any known god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn’t know it doesn’t matter, and the sand tells him the same. When he heard the title of the Eternal and Time Dragon, Kas was obviously stunned, and then he tried desperately, and could not remember what kind of god it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick explanation of the sand is due to two points. First, the dragon of eternal and time is an incomparably powerful god. Its influence is just as its name, and it can even cross the plane and time. Second, if Kas is betrayed again, the power of the eternal and time dragon will burn. In the process of divine power, it is fully shown that the specific manifestation is to accelerate aging, and each priest level will lose ten years of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Carston, who was just rejoicing for the pastor level, turned into a stun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being alive is a good thing, young priests can only comfort themselves. He has no psychological contradiction to this sect who claims to be pursuing mysticism. It is also very common to have secret sacred spokespersons who use secret methods to spread teachings. After all, the power of the power of God is true and true, and the true God's breath is solemn and solemn, not a fearsome evil god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Kas is more concerned about the secular identity of the nobles of the Sequoia Kingdom. He himself has a father who is a baron. This is a family with a history. He originally had a status in the family, but now everything has vanished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sequoia Kingdom and the Iron Triangle Empire are not hostile, but they are not fixed allies. Although there is no war at the national level, armed conflicts in border areas occur from time to time. . In addition, the interests of the blood-stained land, extraordinarily red / naked blood, the two aristocrats have agents there are already open secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the young pastor is still very optimistic. After accepting the reality, he does not feel too depressed, because in the Temple of Xerxes, his future has come to an end. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Richard’s inquiry, Kastan said this was because he had seduce an Earl mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing to say about this. So far, his team of people is mixed, completely a collection of slaves, murderers and backers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard and Liusha walked out of the camp and looked at the dozens of soldiers who were captured. They felt a little tricky, so they consulted Liusha: "What do these people do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liu Sha thought about it and said, "Let Kass deal with it, he should have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha nodded and nodded and said: "Cass ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young pastor immediately ran to Richard and asked what was ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out to the captive soldiers and said, "I want to solve their methods, not killing them, nor let them reveal my secrets." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass face has a hard time, then nodded and took the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha left the soldiers in the camp, brought their followers, and came back to the base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand walked into the base, reaching out and touching it on the gate of the city, a light golden light suddenly appeared, undulating in the air without any irregularity. With. It is very careful to find that the trajectory of the light belt is somewhat different. No matter how it flutters, it does not exceed the scope of the city wall. It seems to be surrounded by an invisible air wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strip is very beautiful, and occasionally it reflects a colorful glow at some angle. However, Richard knew that it was actually an extremely dangerous force of time and space. Even the great magister or the sanctuary did not dare to touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sands lifted the book of time, when the light band approached, it suddenly brightened a few points, and then turned into a faint golden sand of time. They have fallen on the book of time. Then, like the raindrops absorbed by the soil, all of them infiltrated into the cover in an instant, and then the cover of the book of Time was brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands continuously absorbed three scattered time and space forces at the gate, and continued to walk into the base. Whenever her light pace enters an area, there will be one or even a few pale gold bands in the air that is dead and empty, and then the golden sand will fall. Then the whole base was extinguished, shrouded in beautiful and wonderful light and shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mensa family’s forward base is very large, and it took a whole week for the sand to absorb all the power of time, which is equivalent to making this the same. Thoroughly purify the base of the death trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Richard has been staying in the camp and constantly drawing the structure. This time it was a magical increase in the structure, but he prepared for himself. Richard's understanding of his body is naturally deeper than other people's understanding. Therefore, this structure has been greatly modified compared with the standard structure. On the basis of not affecting the effectiveness, the structure is simplified and carried. The requirements for force are lower. The end result is a sophisticated plug-in of the palm size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took off his clothes, entered the magic on the plug-in, activated the structure, and then rubbed the plug with his hand and slowly stuck it on his chest. When the plug-in comes into contact with the skin, it instantly emits a light smoke, which burns a shallow layer on the skin as soon as it burns, then melts and grows with the skin at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of loading the plugin is very painful, and the skin in that area is like being burnt by the soldering iron. After waiting for the plug-in to be in place, Richard breathed out a sigh of relief and wiped the cold sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a few soft knocks were heard, and then the sand was pushed and the door came in. Her eyes fell on the fresh scars on Richard's chest, bowed and asked, "Your new construction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
