			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long arrow is entwined with a distinct green brilliance, bringing this name together The power of the guardian elf hunter is more than half, and the energy attached to the arrow can not only track the target of the guardian elf, but also double the power of the long arrow. In terms of tracking ability, this long arrow can fly to the guardian elf. The location where the eyes are looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long arrow is extremely fast, the locked knight has just found the attack, the arrow is already in front of him, he can’t stop it, he sees the arrow and the chest A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian spirit in the distance grew a sigh of relief, and the whole person softened at once, and even the strength to open the bow again was gone. After the arrow, he had to rest for ten minutes before he could fight again. In one day, he could shoot up to two arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before turning and retreating, the guardian elf finally glanced at his prey, hoping to imprint the dying form of the victim in memory, whenever hunting a powerful beast He has this habit, this time is the same, but this eye looks at the past, his eyes are immediately rounded, and even forgot to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long arrow did hit the knight, and the arrow was buried in the breastplate, but there was a long section of the arrow that was exposed outside. The guardian elf can see that the length of the breastplate is less than ten centimeters. This distance is likely to not even penetrate the ribs, let alone the internal organs, to build the strength that the knights have just shown. At most it is medium damage, and the Cavaliers must have combat ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is an arrow that condenses all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is naturally less powerful than the Sanctuary hunter’s full blow, but it is also enough to break the rough and heavy bark armor of the war tree, as for the activation of the tree, If they are not shot on the stone bombs they are mounted on, they can penetrate them all the way. That is to say, the knight who looks not very strong and burly in the distance, the carapace is thicker than the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of the guardian elves, the war tree people are moving fortresses, the defense is incomparably strong, and those war trees are treated as the ultimate bastion, the war ancient The bark of the tree is equivalent to the wall of the Noland people in the concept of the guardian elf. The ordinary war tree is equivalent to the war behemoth with the enchanted heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the guardian elves can't understand is reality. The construction of the knight is a mature unit of Norland in the long years. It is the combination of quantity, lethality, mobility and adaptability. It is the backbone of the plane war. Rand's general construction of the knight's protection is even thicker than the war tree, and Richard's wildly created series of knights' defense is even better, and Richard's equipment for the knight is worth 100,000. The gold coins are a whole higher level than the normal standard, and the green guardian elves do not know what the plane war is. They understand that the concept of heavy armor is not the same thing as Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how the guardian elf was astonished, the knights who had already started the game began to charge, and the guardian elves immediately began to retreat, and the surviving activation tree people gathered. The guardian guards retreat, but the magical ride is extremely explosive. In the blink of an eye, the knights have already rushed to the front of the activation tree. The front-ranking knights immediately raised the rifle, but not the sniper. Like the battle axe, the guns had a bright light on the front of the gun, and then a huge crescent-shaped light blade came out of the gun. It instantly disappeared dozens of meters away, and disappeared on the light blade route. The activation tree was mostly divided into two. There was a particularly bright light blade that even opened three activated tree people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness strike, this set of ability, after the strength of the construction of the knight, finally revealed the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is like a rolling stream, and instantly rushes to the line of defense tree people to rush to the escaped guardian elf hunter, the speed of the guardian elf is really fast It’s not even slower than the magic ride that rushed up, but the throwing spear of the knight is a weapon that is more powerful than the elf hunter’s full force. A spear throwing a splendid ray of light shines through dozens of spears. An escaped elf hunter, but the other guardian elves escaped back into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Li’s face is frosty, and she is about to let the knights continue to pursue. Richard suddenly shouted: “All retracing.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the knights received the order of Richard, have been holding the magic ride, the entire team drawn an arc at the edge of the forest, once again returned to the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the forest, a group of elf hunters showed their mistakes, but they did not expect the prey to be retracted, and the elf hunters took them. It’s not a longbow, it’s a powerful throwing spear. These throwing spears are longer than the structure of the knight. They are made of heavy hardwood. The spears are inlaid with a few flashes of runes. These spears are blessed by Druid. In the current situation, the power is even more powerful. Every throwing spear has the power of the Elf high-level hunter to make a full blow, and the throwing spear is smeared with poison, once it is Rubbing the skin, the mammoth will be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these knights have actually retracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Liyi looked at Richard indiscriminately. In her opinion, the forest environment is not a problem at all. The wild series Knight and the Qiqi Knight have special reinforcements. The structure of the operational ability, the machine power is absolutely excellent, the previous attack has proved that the attack of the guardian elf has a limited threat to the construction knight, and now it is not the time to pursue the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the sky outside the canopy and said, "Heaven is still dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Alize looked at the sky, now it should be daytime, but now it is black and lacquered like midnight. This kind of abnormal scene makes her frown, but she is the first time to come to Green Forest, not very aware of this. What it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the performance of the forest will gather, fighting in this environment is very unfavorable to us." Richard explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice squinted and asked: "How bad will it be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is adhering to A Kemond’s temperamental character has always tended to fight the enemy through a series of offensives, and the opportunity to pursue the remnant enemy has never been let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the strength of the current forest will, their full blow may have fatal damage to our knights."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is shocked, which means that the knight can have a lot of casualties, which means that the attacking strength of the opponent also reaches the level of the knight, which is the green, the secondary The plane, the number of guardian elves here is even rarer, how can there be a strategic level of force in the formation system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha understands Ellie’s thoughts and says, “The true master here is not the tree people and the guardian spirits we just saw, but they "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Richard pointed to the forest, and Ellie immediately meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the knights back to the tree of life, here is the scope of the tree of the night of the night, how strong the will of the forest will definitely not affect here, in life Within the scope of the tree, the knights can play their combat power normally. There are more than 300 knights in the construction, so you don't need to worry. At least defense is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two large-scale offensives, the guardian elves did not get anything. Instead, they damaged hundreds of high-ranking hunters. According to Lin Haizhong’s standards, this is equivalent to a middle-class tribe being disabled. In the depths of the forest, The proverbs of the proverbs and the Alliance tribes were surrounded by altars, all silent, and the atmosphere was extremely depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, a tribal elder said: "The outsider named Richard has such a strong force. If this time is not the gathering of the forest will, We are afraid that it will be more and more serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what is used." Another tribal elder was angry and eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We hunter tribes have more than one death Fifty, where are your forest cavalry and say good support?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former elder sighed and argued: "We want to They are drawn into the forest will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to do it, people can't come out." The elders of the wind swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang elders frowned and said: "Enough, we are now thinking about how to fight the Yongye tribe, not the time of guilt."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the two elders did not speak, and the elders of the elves surrounded the altar and fell into silence. On the altar, it was repeated. Playing the short but fierce battles, especially the throwing spears that make the knights powerful, even if they are seen through magical images, they are suffocating, and all the elders can’t help but imagine themselves. Before these throwing spears... I think that many elder elders can't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the son of the arrogant Emerald Leaf Tribe Forest, Feng Ye, also surprisingly kept silent, although he is arrogant, but not a fool without vision He is very clear that such a spear throws as long as ten fires are set, he has to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the proverb turned to the black robe and respectfully asked: "What should we do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes slowly said: "Prepare a group of soldiers, let them let go of their hearts, and prepare to carry the will of my Lord, so that you have a powerful warrior who can match the other."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
