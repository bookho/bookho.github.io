			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in every city, people come out from their homes and look up at the sky. They all felt the shudder and uneasiness of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people of order are looking forward to the coming of the day from the moment they fall to the darkness. The out-of-phase between the heavens and the earth shows that the time lighthouse has been built, and the final ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is praying, a little light flies out of them, merges into the fire of time in the center of the city, gathers together, and turns into a golden Light belt, cast into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last time, all those who want to return to the order of the land have turned themselves into a part of the fire of time, protected by the power of the soul Time Lighthouse, against the power of the world in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the top of the Time Lighthouse, and the images in his eyes are different at this moment. He is trying to revisit the world from the perspective of distorted rules. This will be the last time he saw the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, the world of dark areas suddenly changed. The sky here is a faint purple, and the light from the sky is the source of life for every aboriginal. On the earth, you can see tall soul wood and purple patches of grass. These pastures are all energy-like, some indigenous people are harvesting, while others are transporting the harvested pastures back to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These purple pastures are the food of the aborigines. There are many other varieties of energy plants that can also be used as food, but purple unknown pastures are the most widely distributed. Almost every aboriginal material has a large number of lush purple pastures, and it seems that the aborigines already have the ability to grow them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness is no longer dead, but full of vitality. Only people can't see the aborigines, and they can't see these pieces of purple pasture. Under the twisting rules, there is only one empty and dead wilderness in the eyes of the people of order, and these creatures of pure dark energy state cannot be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the colorful plains, there are large black spots. There is an area of ​​energy and lack of vitality, and all the aborigines will be careful to avoid it. In the center of those huge dark spots, it is the city built by the people of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in the plains, a black spot suddenly appeared, and then like the ink that fell in the water, the black quickly spread. In the center of the dark spot, one person is struggling to stand up. Obviously, this is another person who falls into the dark. The energy he carries is as powerful as the energy life on the plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the person stood up, he swayed to a nearby city. It seems that his strength and luck are good, he should be able to go to the city and live. But behind this person, there was a dark, slanting line that was imprinted on a colorful plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of aborigines appeared, and they carefully avoided the black area, crying heartily and helplessly. These aborigines constantly spray colored water droplets from the body and pour in areas that are branded with black energy. Black does have a slight relief, but at this pace, it takes a whole week to completely eliminate the toxic energy of black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in front did not hear the aboriginal screams, he just walked tenaciously, and Richard looked at it all. But the efforts of these aborigines are already doomed to be useless. When Richard ignited the lighthouse, it all ended. The place of dawn will disappear from the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood the words left by Liushuang on the pages of the book of Time: The real world is often the opposite of what we have seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This colorful and lively energy world is the true face of the dark region. For the world, not the dark areas distorted the rules, but the rules that these outsiders distorted the dark areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragon is the biggest twister, and its gods have succeeded in distorting the rules of the dark regions through generations of effort. The rules for the land of order. In this way, the whole area will be separated from the dark areas, and the kingdom of eternal and time dragons will be joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the aborigines in the dark, the gods of the old dragon and the people of Richard are no different from the reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha secretly sighed, the truth is not always pleasant, the more you know, the more he will be heavy. Perhaps it is not just sand, but other people who have discovered the real world of dark regions. Just don't know what they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotion in the heart is one thing, and the action is one thing. Richard will not give up the lighthouse of the time because of the momentary feelings. This is not only for the self, but also for the people who are struggling in the land of dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li turned and opened the book of Time, a golden glow shot from the pages of the book, illuminating the wick of the brazier. The wick immediately jumped a few golden sparks, then swayed and eventually turned into a small flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ignition seedlings ignited, Richard seemed to hear a click, and then the image he saw was like a broken glass, covered with strips. Cracked. A piece of debris came off and rolled in the air. After it fell off the whole scene, it was actually an endless void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more clicks in Richard’s ear, which is the sound of broken rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision remains in the dark regional rules, and you can see that there is a huge dark spot on the bright plain, with black The mist ejected from the dark spots. The sky is also cracked, and the cracks of the road stretch out hundreds or even thousands of kilometers. From these cracks, from time to time, the energy of black ink, such as ink, drip, and large patches of black spots were dyed on the plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aborigines are completely panicked, they are aiming to fly, but whether in the air or on the ground, black energy is increasing. A black mist rushes through, and the purple energy grasses will burn completely and then turn into a void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li saw with his own eyes that there was a hundred meters of dark black energy dripping in the sky, falling on an aboriginal village. The twisted nodes that protected the village immediately dissipated, and the village was also flooded by black tides. When the Kuroshio retreats, the villages can no longer be seen, and there are no longer Aboriginal people in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole place of dawn is full of doomsday scenes. Numerous indigenous creatures that Richard had never seen before flew out of the hiding place and flew in desperation. But the Kuroshio is coming from all directions, and there are fewer and fewer places to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Kuroshio, all the aborigines were so weak, even the butcher who had made Richard a headache, was overwhelmed by a Kurdish lang head. After that, it will immediately become a residue in one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Kuroshio are actually the power of order and time. In Richard's dark regional vision, it became a horrible harvest of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the copper basin, the fire of time is burning. Only the flame he saw at this time was not gold, but black. Numerous black energy bubbles are extinguished around the lights. Every black energy bubble disappears, and on the plain of the dawning ground, there will be a new black pool. Or it will drip a black energy from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Kuroshio, the energy of color is not only digested, assimilated, but is constantly broken and annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of time is a key, it does not rely on itself, but to set up a channel between the dark region and the order of the country, so that the power of order and time can be sourced Constantly enter the dark areas, thus completely destroying the underlying rules here, and dip the dawn into a state of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a pain in his eyes, and his blood began to turbulent. He knew that this was his own rule of using dark areas, and now he has begun to be attacked by order and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of the mind turns, the energy in the body begins to operate according to the rules of order and time. Then the image he saw was changed again. In the copper basin, the fire of the golden time was burning. A number of beautiful light strips connect the time lighthouse to all the cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is no longer gray, but the same red. There is a huge gap in the cracks. From the cracks, the golden light is shining, and the light and heat are constantly sprinkled to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time in the lonely wilderness has life, with light and warmth, and then with water, then it will take a long time to be full of life. Hope the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie seems to have heard the cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, standing on the lighthouse of the time, his gaze can be extended to every corner of the dawning land. Richard saw that in the city, people are carnival, singing and dancing like a madman. The wine that was used for life has now become an ordinary drink for everyone to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
