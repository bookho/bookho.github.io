I don’t know where to go. It was discovered that Richard was again a double eyebrow. The electro-light flashed on his body, driving the magical armor, and the action suddenly accelerated. After passing the monster, he flew the fate of the twins, and exiled the tomb of the light, the aliens, the dissociation, and so on. But without exception, the effects of magic are small. Not only did the dissociation not dissociate the monster, it even failed to make it cry. Obviously, the additional damage effect after the dissociation failure does not take effect at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is still fierce, the residual magic effect is quickly washed away by it, and its slam is getting closer and closer to Richard. Even if Richard uses the magical arm, it is not the opponent of this monster in speed. The ruined tentacles are also constantly slamming Richard, and its attacks are even more preventable. Richard looked more and more embarrassed, and finally the monster rushed to a close enough distance and took a bite to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, the flash of the cold flashed, and the magical armed forces were rushed to the extreme, the speed suddenly increased, flashing the monster’s flutter, and then brutal slaughtering the long knife狠狠 狠狠 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪 怪<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge wound, but the real fatality is after Richard's knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the monster suddenly stagnated, and the four eyes showed extreme horror! It screamed and suddenly there were more than a dozen cracks on the wound cut by Richard, and each crack was actually an unusually deep wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tear, the special effects of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood then squirts out of the wound! It is not a rush, but a spray. When the blood flow effect is superimposed too much, it will cause such a fountain-like out of phase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds of the monster's wounds began to roll, and there was a piece of grayish white that was lost in life. It was also seen that many intact flesh and blood were constantly violent and became a group. Blood fog. Necrosis and flesh and blood burst, it looks like a silent, another abnormal glare, but the degree of damage, but the same horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the blood flow of the monster slows down and the wound does not creep. It quietly crouches for a moment, as if the biggest crisis has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the monster suddenly screamed, and the wound was caught by countless invisible hands, and it was torn open! This lower wound was so cleaved, half of the body cracked open, and then a group of more than ten meters of blood fog was shot from the wound! There are blood and flesh in the blood fog, and there are also unknown visceral fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, seeing that Richard is also a moment. This is the first time that he has installed four lives for himself. For the first time, he has made a full effort against a roughly equal enemy. He finally saw the horror of the full-scale explosion of life after the superposition. He can now stack up to ten attacks in a single hit. If there are more overlays, the effects will be even more terrifying. Richard remembered the characteristics of life, and claimed to be the first to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a knife also makes Richard's body energy empty, and the residual magic and physical strength have dropped to a rather dangerous level. Richard refused to scrutinize the monsters, hurriedly decomposed and collected some of the most important materials, and then cut a small piece of intact cortex for future research, and hurriedly left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakso Das people have an unusually sensitive perception. For a long time, Dakosodas people who are dozens of kilometers away can smell the blood. gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Richard’s departure, the two groups of black mists floated. In the fog are two black magicians who carefully examined all the traces on the battlefield before they came to the scene where the monster was dismembered, and talked from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard is sitting under a leeward rock, slightly closing his eyes, performing shallow meditation while cutting the monster into pieces. The meat is put into the mouth, sometimes chewed twice, and more often it is swallowed. The energy of the monster meat is slightly inferior to that of the mouse, but the meat of the mouse is delicious. The meat of this monster is difficult to swallow, and it is very stinky. Chewing a bit like a bite in the sewer. But Richard forced himself to swallow it, because it was the only source of added strength and moisture. But even with his will, it takes a while for each bite to slow down. The meat of the monster is so weird, it is simply the instinct to challenge human survival. In the state of shallow meditation, most of Richard's feelings become dull, and only in this state can he swallow the pieces of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat quietly, not paying attention to the consumption of time. At this moment, he suddenly felt that the earth beneath him was shaking slightly. In the vision of meditation, Richard suddenly perceived that a touch of blood energy spilled from the void, constantly twisting and struggling, and it was extremely painful. . As soon as it appeared, it gave Richard an indescribable feeling. This is similar to the feeling of seeing the tree of life in the Greenson plane. It is a feeling of ignorance, fear, confusion and excitement. . This shows that this blood color energy contains the power of the plane rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard immediately explored and captured the blood of this blood. As soon as his will touched the blood of the blood, he immediately felt the same pain as the burning. But Richard can understand the indescribable power contained in the blood energy. Maybe it was just a drop of water, but from this drop, you can see the whole sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the source of the plane. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of the super strong to extract the potential power of the plane, the dead plane will also tremble, thus overflowing some of the planes. The so-called plane is dead, that is, the rules of balance have been broken, the power of the plane can no longer maintain the stability of the entire plane, and it is constantly being consumed, but it cannot be supplemented. When the plane surface is completely exhausted, the entire plane will collapse. What appears now in front of Richard and captured is the most primitive energy of a plane. The burning sensation is the conflict between the rules of the dusk and the nature of Richard's power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that this bloody power turned out to be the power of the plane, and Richard immediately became surprised and happy. This is an excellent opportunity to understand the rules of the plane. The time of the tree of life is more than ever. Richard immediately resisted the pain and forcibly dragged the blood energy into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the source of this plane entered the body, all the blood of Richard began to appear, vibrate, and made a roar of uneasiness. The power of the rules it represents is too large, so that the blood of Richard's not yet fully grown is fearful. In Richard's body, the blood color energy began to melt, and the silky scorpion was absorbed by Richard. But most of the power contained in this source is opposed to Richard's own energy, and is consumed in vain. This is not a waste. In the process, Richard is frantically interpreting the rules contained in the blood energy. It’s just that this source of energy is too little, it will soon be consumed, and Richard’s analysis is only the beginning, and even how many rules it contains are unclear. Now in the eyes of Richard, this source of energy is a cloud of fog, which may have countless contents, but it is impossible to see even the most general outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the analysis of Richard can dispel the fog, then it is only one step away from the rules of the touch plane. But Richard does not know how much of the source power to absorb to reach the level of the rules of the touch plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he continues to analyze the power of the source, the magical world tree that has been silent has suddenly moved! All of its roots are dancing, frantically wrapped around the remaining source power, and exhausted all efforts to extract the power of the source. The bite source has a beast that is bitten, and it actually makes a sharp call! There is a sharp needle in the sound of the scream, and it has a headache that is extremely incomparable. Although the remaining power of the plane source is almost the same, there is no comparison with the magical world tree that has evolved to the fourth order, but it may feel the final demise, just like the breath of the ups and downs. Swelling and shrinking, constantly projecting the light of the blood to the roots of the magical world surrounded by layers. As long as the roots are contaminated with blood, they will immediately burst and burn, turning into a section of coke falling. The entire tree of the Magic Star Tree began to tremble, and it was obvious that the roots had to be destroyed and it was very painful. However, one layer of roots must be destroyed, and the other layer of roots must be immediately followed up, smashing to the ground of the plane. The source of the plane is constantly emitting a bleed of light, and each time it is shot, its luster will be dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
