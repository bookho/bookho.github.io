			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward took Richard into a region he had never passed, along A dark and damp rumor took a long time to pick up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a six-story building on the side of the castle. There is no environment for the layout. The rooms are dense and small, obviously to accommodate as many people as possible in a limited space. . There are five such buildings, and most of the young people sent by the pedigree are living here. They are also some of the high-ranking servants of the Archimonde family, as well as the senior guards of the guards and the young war knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the small size of the floating island, many of the five buildings are two or even four. Coco lived on the top floor, which was allocated to the young men and women of the collateral family. However, since no partners were selected, these boys and girls were assigned to separate rooms for the convenience of access. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper is obviously familiar with everyone on the floating island. Although there are servants on the road to salute him, he does not need to stop to ask, but Directly took Richard to the front of the door at the end of the corridor and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one is it?" The soft voice of cocoa came from behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler reported his name, and Coco immediately screamed and said a little. After a while, Coco opened the door. She was wrapped in a thick shawl, wrapped around the upper body, revealing a white nightdress that grew to the ankles, and the little feet on the carpet were slick and glaring. It’s already late, and it’s obvious that Coco’s looks have been sleeping before being woken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these young boys and girls, the steward on the floating island can be said to be an important person behind Gotton, especially for those who are not strong in their own family. This is especially true for people. So when I heard the housekeeper outside, the cocoa quickly climbed up and wrapped the shawl to open the door, even not changing clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the housekeeper, and also saw the Richard behind the housekeeper, as if she understood something, immediately slammed her body and said: "It is going to be done now." Magic experiment? Please wait a few minutes, I can change clothes right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of this job for cocoa is obviously far from sleep Above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler waved to stop the cocoa, saying in a constant slow and steady tone: "No, nothing to do with the magic experiment. Cocoa. Mary. Archimonde, You have been honoured to be designated as the first companion by Master Richard. Because Master Li will leave early tomorrow morning, I will stay here for you tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What!?" Coco exclaimed, his face instantly became white, and he couldn't help but step back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler is not going to repeat it to her again, but instead let the road out of the way and said to Richard: "Young master, please come in. Also five tomorrow morning When I arrive at the clock, I will call you to have breakfast. The departure time is 6:30. The journey tomorrow is very long, so please be restrained tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li said with no expression, just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper turned and prepared to leave, Coco suddenly rushed out of the room, grabbed him, and hurriedly asked: "Adult! How could it be me? You must It’s a mistake, yes, it must be!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper did not try to get rid of or explain, and did not seem to notice anything wrong with Coco's behavior and tone. It was only elegantly feasible, but his unexplained attitude showed that there was absolutely no mistake. In fact, the old butler who has been in the 60th year seems to have never made mistakes in the past two decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard, who was shackled at the door of the room, said faintly behind them: "You are my choice, there is nothing wrong."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa opened his mouth and took a moment to rush to the front of Richard, and bowed deeply, saying: "Master Li, please seriously consider it again. Once! You know that I don't have any blood abilities, it's just a second-level illusionist. I don't have any talent in any way. Don't say that you are such a great genius, that is, I can't match a normal tribe. I can't give birth to you. The excellent offspring needed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned, keenly felt the reaction of cocoa, including what she said was overdone, no matter what the reason behind, already There was a faint anger in his heart. Any teenager who is just as bloody is so rejected, it will always be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of cocoa is very loud. There are several doors on both sides of the corridor that open, and several heads are found from inside, there are men and women. When they saw the situation, they spit out their tongues, or smiled at the housekeeper, and they shrank back. The faces of several girls were full of envy and jealousy. They couldn't figure out how they could, but the cocoa, which had almost no advantages except the face, was suddenly seen by Richard. Did she bring her natural luck or natural charm, but why didn't she see it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls cursed in the back of the door and were all caught in the ears by Li, but he only heard nothing. Looking at Coco's pale and weak face and the big eyes that had begun to get wet, Richard looked up and asked the butler: "Can you still change your partner now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housekeeper couldn’t see anything in his eyes. With a constant voice, he kept respectfulness without adding a point or a point. He replied: "This is your choice, and it has been approved by the patriarch and has come into effect. It's hard to change. If you have a better candidate in your mind now, my personal suggestion is that I can choose it again. Anyway, you have the right to make multiple decisions. The meaning of this plural is personally understood and is not limited to two. Of course, If you insist on changing instead of choosing one more, you can do it, but you need to go through some necessary procedures. First, you need to get the consent of Gordon. Second, prove that you have used cocoa, ..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the butler narrated the long conditions, the face of the cocoa immediately ignited hope. It seems that she wants to say something, but she is not too stupid. She did not take the trouble to interrupt the butler and interjected, and did not persuade Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a light and rapid footstep on the stairs, and a handsome young man appeared on the stairs. What Li felt was, suddenly turned back, a pair of cold eyes fell on the young man. And the butler did not know when to turn to face the stairs, looking at the young man peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the temperature on the sixth floor seems to have fallen below the freezing point, and people can’t help but fight a chill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s movement suddenly became stiff, his eyes moved from Richard to the housekeeper, then to the cocoa, and then gave her a deep look. But with the calm and deep eyes of the butler, the sweat began to rush out of the forehead of the young man, and finally failed to shout out the prepared words from the throat. He stiffly bowed to the butler and said, "Walk the wrong floor," and turned and slowly went downstairs. The hard and heavy steps seem to be his current mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
