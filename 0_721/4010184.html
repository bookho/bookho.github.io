			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several toll stations have already broken ground, and Richard has set the The tax rate is 10% of all transit goods. If it is a goods that cannot be divided, it can also be discounted and converted into gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of Faro, the tax rate set by Richard was low. At that time, many people opposed and said that the tax rate was completely unbelievable. However, Richard decided to follow this and announced that the caravans who did not pay the tolls were not allowed to enter the blood-stained area. If a caravan enters privately, it will not guarantee their safety in the blood-stained area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a low tax rate would make tax evasion no longer desirable, because that would risk the entire caravan. The low tax rate also makes it unnecessary to bypass the Iron Triangle Empire, and the tax rate is much higher through the same border cities. And because the empire's center of gravity is in the east and north, the law and order in the southern mountains has always been not so good, and luck will almost encounter thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will send several cavalry to wander through the entire blood-stained area. Once the caravans that do not pay taxes are found, these cavalry will immediately turn into horses. bandit. And those caravans who have paid taxes will find that these cavalry have turned into the natural enemies of the stables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in fact, this is just to add a fig leaf to yourself. His next plan is to announce the inclusion of the entire blood-stained land in his territory when the time is right, and then march into the ancestral plateau and pale highlands to further reduce the living space of barbarians and dwarves. At that time, if any caravan wants to pass the blood-stained land without paying taxes, Richard can justifiably levy all their goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the low tax rate, huge business opportunities and the consequences that cannot be borne by the tax are combined, Richard believes that any organization can organize a dye through The people of the Blood Land Caravan have enough wisdom to know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of Richard was passed in the silence of his fanatical supporters and the silence of the nobility who had been deterred by his previous record. Of course, he also knows that it is impossible for the nobles, especially the aristocrats of the Iron Triangle Empire, to accept the taxation right of his ‘righteousness’. But Richard is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only stayed in Noland for a few days, and Faro passed another month. A month's time means that there are hundreds more humanoid knights under Richard. Seeing that his number of knights would be broken, then Richard found that his weapons and equipment were not enough. At this time, he deeply felt that the war was really burning money, and equipped with a super-elite force of a thousand people, the actual investment has exceeded 10 million. Of course, this is the reason for his pursuit of excellence in equipment. It is the first-rate standard to arm a knight with five thousand gold coins in the Faro standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged for the force arrangement, Richard paused and looked at the followers in the conference room and suddenly began to have a headache. The key is that he does not know who should be left to preside over the overall situation of the Faro plane. Gangde, water splash, ogre... Richard’s sight swept through one follower and ended up staying in Io. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat priest is very disgusted by Richard, but he has to admit that this guy does have real material, and he also showed a superb battlefield in the past battles. Smell, it can be said that the understanding of the local battle is second only to Richard. But Richard knows that his strengths are incapable of reproduction. Because of the wisdom and true talent, and the connection with the nesting elite units, the battlefield is equivalent to full transparency for Richard. This made the tactical command of Richard invincible. These three conditions are the same, and Richard is no better than Io. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the fighting sergeant's wisdom is outstanding, the appearance is elegant, can be mined with the nobles, playing the intrigues and tricks is not inferior, it is the perfect choice for a plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Li sighed and shook his head in front of everyone, but the first one excluded Io. Faro is the base camp of Richard, and he is the foundation of it. There is no room for omission. Therefore, when choosing a guard general, loyalty is the first element. As for ability, it is good to go. Richard does not seek to be able to open up the territory, as long as it is not lost. In a major battle, he must come back to preside over the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second candidate is a quicksand. In addition to directing the battle, this god girl is not as good as Iraq. I can't see that she has any place worse than Io. However, quicksand is a girl who often creates miracles. She just did not independently direct a large-scale battle. If she let her exercise for a while, maybe there will be a generation of famous players. As for the local battlefield, as long as I think that she can often add a shield or a life reply to the warrior before the enemy weapon falls, she can know how sharp and precise her judgment is. It’s just that a godsman is going to be a famous general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard looked at the sand with a deep look, but decided to take her with her. Sometimes making decisions doesn't just take reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just trying to take her with her, no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard’s gaze moved to the next person, a slight smile on the lips of the flowing sand was very satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard finally had a difficult decision, reaching out to Gangde and saying, "Gund! You are leaving!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde immediately jumped up: "Hey? Head! This is not good! How can you throw me in this ghost place where the bird is not pulling? You see, now it is fundamental There is no beating! It’s okay to leave Oral. This kid has a very good set of people for the nobility.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee undoubtedly to Gangde One finger, said: "It's you! Oral wants to go with me, I will leave you to Iraq."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of the fighting officer Solidified, Huo Di stood up, just wanted to oppose, the sand immediately next to it coughed. The expression of Iowo is even stiffer. He turns his head and looks at the sand, but sees that the girl is looking at her left hand nails. Her hands are long and powerful, her nails are moist and round, perfect, and there is no need to modify it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Israel, what do you think?" Richard asked faintly, but revealed a vague murderous light. joke! Li has beaten Iraq and Russia in the fight last time. Now he has come back from the battlefield in the field. The whole person’s understanding of killing power has risen to the next level. If Iraq and Russia dare to provoke, it is once Hit it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, beyond Richard’s surprise, Io actually sat back in a depressed position and said, “No idea.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chest of a chest, Wu Yong suddenly vented, and bowed, said: "Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the moment, Iowo remembered the most real threat of quicksand: re-create a female combat priest, instead of raising his upper limit to eighteen. What worried Iran and Russia is that the combined effect of the two 16-level combat priests must be more than one 18-level battle priest. The problem is that Iowa is a special one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the cruel reality makes Io understand that the special one sometimes doesn’t work, and the sand that controls his upgrade limit is really special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
