			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last days of the ink fly into the hands of Richard, the two doors of the temple are immediately closed Obviously, Vatican does not want to have further communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to Nolan, thoughtfully, and asked: "It just seems to be a will left by His Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan nodded and said, "Yes, His Royal Highness Van Gogh has already set off and went to a very distant place. I thought that my Highness had already left. I didn't expect her to stay for a while. Until you come to the Eternal Dragon Hall, this will only be activated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the temple going down." Richard asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That place... can't say it." Nolan gave an answer that made Richard feel familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, I am going back to Faro. Do you have anything I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan indulged and said, "Your enemies seem to be getting more and more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "This There is no way to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan looked at Richard, and there was a faint sorrow in the eyebrows, saying: "But you still have to be careful, I have tried recently. Watching your destiny a few times, every time I always feel that there is a huge risk of inexplicable being close to you. This danger seems to have been around you for a long time, so that it is almost ignored, I only You can see an approximation vaguely, so you must be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately grabbed a few keywords, all of which point to It’s a shadow creature that hasn’t appeared for a long time. Su Hailun has temporarily blocked the passage of the Shadow Corps into the world. Is it because Su Hailun’s seal has a problem, but Nolan’s only sees it. Paste prophecy, and there is no clear point, so it can only reminded Richard beware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the temple, Richard suddenly remembered something and asked, "Is your god grace enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Nolan smiled and said: "For the time being, you can protect yourself. Don't worry about me. In a few days, the Tulan family will have a sacrifice. I will get some grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and said, "I will get some sacrifices back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice is only a small matter, you should do things normally, don't consider me. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the floating island, Richard came to the magic laboratory for the first time, put the last imprint on the experimental bench, and observed it nearby. The Doomsday Seal has completely changed. Now it is a transparent crystal ball. There is a dark, strange metal crystal floating inside. The end of the imprint is now in a state of being detectable and observable, not the one that was just received that day. The secret is shrouded in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin did not know what kind of means to peel off the protective shell on this doomsday mark, revealing the hidden secrets inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated attempts, Richard discovered that the Doomsday Mark responded to the magic and other forms of energy, and he immediately tried to enter the magic, inside the crystal ball. The metal block began to tremble slightly, as if a tiny alchemy machine was starting, Richard gradually increased the input of magic, and the tremor of the metal block began to become apparent. When the magic input increased to the level of the big magician, the whole end The mark made a squeaking sound, and several cracks appeared at the front end of the metal block. The orange light was emitted from the inside, and then the front part of the metal block was split. Several pieces of the shell opened like petals, and a new one emerged from the inside. A metal strip of the size of a finger and extending forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a metal block at all, it’s a machine that is so delicate and incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sees the concentration of the eyes, the eyes that radiate the light do not let go of every detail, the machinery in the end of the imprint changes constantly, and in a blink of an eye, it turns into a ship. Something similar to the magic ship, but it only stabilized for one second in this form, and then changed to the next form. In the blink of an eye, the mysterious machine in the imprint changed hundreds of forms, each part inside. It seems that all can be split into several or even dozens of smaller parts. Those parts that are already inseparable in Richard's eyes will split into countless tiny parts that are almost indistinguishable. In the decomposition, on the other hand, it is constantly combined to become a new part, and then become part of the next form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magical machine, just like having your own life and soul, there are constantly changing shapes, and the most subtle changes are used. Richard, who had an insight, could only barely see it clearly, but there are still more subtle changes that even the insight can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard's vision, countless numbers are falling like waterfalls, and the amount of data makes it difficult for him to remember his wisdom, not to mention the analytical model, and he has not seen it because of the insight. Many of the more subtle changes, so the data is obtained, and it is also incomplete, whether it is possible to establish a feasible analytical model or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard has an intuition that the Doomsday Seal and the Reaper represent a new system of rules, and the Doomsday Seal is finally dealt with by Vatican. The state that can be parsed, but the difficulty of parsing is far higher than any rules that Richard has touched. It is almost the same as the rules seen on the scales of Su Hailun’s fate. The two rules are hard to say at the moment which is more advanced because Li There is no possibility of successful analysis of the current wisdom talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard suddenly felt a dizzy, had to retreat from the state of insight, he looked at the magic clock and found that time passed. In less than ten minutes, such a short period of time exhausted Richard's magic and energy. For the first time, Richard was so clearly aware that the two talents were not enough to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the doomsday mark in the palm of his hand. At this moment, because the input of magic power was stopped, the metal inside was restored to its original state, and there was no abnormality. After the end of the seal, I found a small box of magic, and carefully put it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard is tired, but he feels that the true talent that has not changed for a long time has signs of looming breakthrough. This is an unexpected surprise. The change of the doomsday mark, the real talent is likely to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment there was still some time from dawn, so Richard took time to meditate and finally added the magic to the half before the scheduled departure time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the difference in time and flow rate, this time, the Faro was fifteen days passed. In these fifteen days, Faro has undergone many changes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general convening of followers, sacred strongmen, great mentors, and generals did not know how to divulge them, and then passed them at an incredible speed. Opened, and the border of the deep red Principality, spread far and wide in the human kingdom. In the blink of an eye, all the countries know that Richard wants to do something big, but he does not know that his goal this time. Who is a great empire, or a god in a secular church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news suddenly aroused too much uneasiness. The kings and church bishops of all countries held secret meetings almost at the first time. Then the second angels set off and tried to reach some secrets before Richard really took action. The horror of the Crimson Principality has long been known to all human beings. It is only seen that the Chonghong Principality has almost monopolized the slave trade in the western part of the mainland, and the financial resources are rolling, but no one has raised any objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the summoning order that should have been secret was like a wing, and spread like a wind to half the human kingdom of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the territory of the Duke of Glasgow, there is a beautiful mirror lake, and the mirror lake on the lakeside is known as one of the most beautiful castles in the Sequoia Kingdom. Jinghu Castle is famous for its beautiful scenery and beautiful architecture. It is not known for its warfare and other war functions. It is not far from the castle. It is built with a military camp, where a whole team of knights and nearly a thousand infantry are stationed. This is The main force guarding the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upper level of the castle on the lake, a special area is isolated. This area has a bedroom, a living room and a study, forming a semi-independent space. The carpet in the area is light blue, not the deep red in other places. When entering this special area, both the maid and the guard will deliberately suppress the sound, so this area is very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several heavily armed knights guarding several entrances in the area. They are not the emblem of Glasgow, but are the symbol of the royal family. This area is actually the Guardian Knight of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large central bedroom, there is a huge luxury bed with a pink and white young man lying on his back, which is sleeping. It was the grandson of the Duke of Glasgow, the blood of the unicorn, and the blood of the sacred Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two noble youths are standing outside the big bedroom and chatting about the political situation across the continent. The most important event in front of Faro is the call of Richard. Therefore, the focus of their discussion naturally cannot be separated from this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that this deep red Grand Richard is going to call all the strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, there are a lot of township strongmen under the deep red grand prince. This time his butcher knife doesn't know who he will turn to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
