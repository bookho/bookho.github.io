"A radiance of magicalism fell on Richard's head." Richard began to release the fireball, although this time is just ordinary fireball, but the speed of casting is almost incredible! Just a hundred meters away, there are actually seven or eight fireballs in a line, while flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to look at the ending, the two big magisters immediately flashed a thought in their hearts, Zaku must not even find the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what they can judge, Richard can also judge, the eighth fireball shot, the person begins to turn, the ninth fireball has been shot to another A great magister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s long laughter, the great magister only had time to scream: “Richard!” was drowned by the raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of eleven fireballs instantly poured into the second great magister, and there was a scream in the heavy fire, then at the center of the fire Suddenly a magical storm was blown up, and all the fires were extinguished in an instant. The great magister walked out of the embers and fell to the ground without taking a few steps. He looked extremely embarrassed, his hair, eyebrows and beard almost wiped out, and the Master's robe burned down most of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great magician did not expect that Richard would attack himself, but did not expect that the fireball would violate the magic principle, such as the flood of mountains . Fortunately, his big magician title is not white, the magical defense of the wizard's robe is instantly activated, a magic scroll is used, and a magic shield is finally released with a fireball bombardment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other big magister around him was a little longer when he was scared, but he eventually gave him a magic defense. So this big magister was also seriously wounded, so he left a half life, but there is no power to fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard’s magic power has been exhausted. It’s a pity that he looks at the black magician’s mentor. He wants to pull the knife forward and give him a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a strong magical wave in the middle of the battlefield, and then a portal appeared in mid-air, Zaku took out from the portal and then lost balance. In the air, I fell to the ground and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transition of the outside world! He / milk / milk /, so can not die!" Richard could not help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation in Zaku is not better than the big magician who is almost half cooked. He briefly transferred to the outside world and avoided it. Killing the body, but the first three bursting fireballs have seriously injured him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! Kill Richard!" Zaku no longer cares about the demeanor and credibility, the face is distorted, screaming wildly. Now that Richard is far from his own guard, the coalition's cavalry immediately gathered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and turned over the back of the unicorn, pulling up the sand and letting her sit behind her. Then, in the face of the knight knight who is madly approaching, he laughed and took out the book of the bearer and opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong magical light flashed through, and a total of twelve raptors who were more fierce than violent bears appeared on the battlefield. What is stunned is that when the twelve raptors are summoned, they are arranged in a neat semi-circle, blocking Richard and the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raptor's breath naturally frightened the coalition's horses. They burst into low-pitched, slammed into the coalition, and bite a bite with a big mouth, and they would tear a piece from the horse or the knight's thigh. Meat comes. The armor of the Allied Knights is also extremely soft and fragile under their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were twelve raptors stopping the enemy, and Richard immediately returned to the camp. At this moment, the unicorn finally showed its characteristics as a legendary creature. Although it carried two people, the speed of running was not slow, and it was even faster than the top horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the great magister who survived the difficulty pointed to the bronze-bearing book in the hands of Richard, and shivered: "Artifact! That is an artifact!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artifact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all people, even Zaku, who is fleeing to his own cavalry front, couldn’t help but look back at the book of bearing in the hands of Richard. The flames of the ** are unmasked! An artifact, no matter what level, is enough to be the fuse of war between the two kingdoms. This kind of temptation is not at all Zaku can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Zaku, who was deeply attacked in the magic showdown, finally found a bit of comfort, defeated a 13-level master magician, and lost in one The artifact is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the greed of the coalition forces, Richard only sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaku quickly recognized the reality, not to mention the artifact that wanted to snatch Richard, now even if it is alive to escape . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the periphery, Richard’s five supporters have formed an encirclement, and each unit is rushing at full speed under the leadership of a knight with a scarlet armor. The cavalry units of the coalition forces were bitten by the main force of Richard, and they simply could not get away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhausted magic of Richard has retreated to the rear, but still commanding the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five hundred elite knights of the Allied Forces guarded the three great magisters in the center and fought with the same number of humanoid knights. The other hundreds of humanoid knights have assembled into a dense formation, such as a sharp knife, constantly cutting the complete front of the coalition cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the battlefield of the coalition’s central army, and summoned a burning meteorite in the last good big magister, and stumbled over a dozen humanoid knights. Later, Richard knew that the time had come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness, Richard issued an order that had already been prepared, and at the same time yelled "Israel!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting sergeant screamed out of the crowd. In front of him, Gangde is holding a big axe, and roaring like a wild animal, rushing to the coalition army! Behind him, five strange knights lined up in a dense front, followed by Gangde. Six horses riding a huge iron hoof on the ground, and the earth is shaking, the earth is shaking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the five knights occasionally have a shimmer of light, extending from the breastplate to the mount, the lines and nodes are like a magical array. If the eyesight is strong enough, you will find that the patterns are exactly the same, without any difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel is also excited by the mighty charge of this team of knights, yelling, the magic is like rain, and I don’t know how many gods are falling on them. Surgery. The fierceness of the gain effect is at least equivalent to a few second-order configurations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of a kingdom knight who led the coalition’s Chinese army saw a bad situation, screaming, and the whole body was shining, welcoming Gangde! Gangde sings a magnified laugh, the big axe is round, the legs are a clip, and the squatting dragon rides directly into the air. The giant axe with the evil wind, with the weight of Gangde and the magic ride, headed to the captain of the kingdom knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain shouted, struggling to cross the gun and holding a shot from Gangde! The axe guns slammed the brakes, and the captain of the team made a dazzling ray of light, and it was actually a sanctuary strong! However, he slammed the giant axe of Gangde, but he could not bear the impact of the giant horse, and he mourned and squatted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was backlashed by Juli, and the squatting squats back a few steps. The arms were even more numb, to his present The strength and the strength of the sanctuary are still a little bit worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the two knights quickly rushed out from Gangde, and the guns in their hands rushed to the Cavaliers captain. An extremely dangerous feeling floated on the head of the captain. He screamed and screamed at the deformed gun in his hand, while holding the two guns stabbed. However, at this moment, the two knights suddenly screamed at the same time, the guns illuminate the dazzling blue light, gathered at the tip of the gun, and finally condensed into a brilliance of dazzling blindness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain only felt that the power of the gun was almost doubled, and he couldn’t hold his weapon anymore, watching it fly. sky. The two knights' guns were divided into left and right ribs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde went back and passed, passing behind the captain, and he swung his head with a big axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary of the squadron was killed and no longer able to stop the power of this team. Gangde led five knights into the coalition. When the knife passed over the cheese, he cut it through the circle and left only dozens of bodies behind him. Enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde screamed, the giant axe danced in the air, and a bloody bead on the axe blade. He turned to the magic ride and turned around and entered the coalition army. The five knights still maintained a strict team shape, and then followed Gangde again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the giant axe of Gangde pointed to the only intact magician! The big magician suddenly broke his heart and even dared not cast a spell. Instead, he directly blessed himself with a flying technique. He even swayed and flew up, and he seemed to want to escape the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time the founding knight has appeared in Faro, though it is only a small team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying on the battlefield is definitely a stupid move, which means becoming a living target for enemy magicians and archers. But the great magician apparently did not think so much, he was deeply shocked, and he only wanted to leave this hellish place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral is trying to maintain the effect of the Elf Warsong, and he was caught off guard by the time, and did not have time to shoot. However, the lieutenants in the Richards team were among the dragons and tigers. During the moment, a number of brilliances of light balls rose up, and a beautiful trajectory was drawn in the air, instantly hitting the big magician in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the big magician in the air has countless negative states, including sluggishness, heavyness, paralysis, madness, silence, poisoning, etc. Wait. There are magic and magical techniques, from Clark, Sander, Tiramisu, Io, and quicksand. Among them, Iowo immediately threw three magical techniques, and the sand was thrown two. These guys are either old-fashioned or genius, and they know how to leave a guy who wants to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
