			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood parrot still maintains a posture that can be attacked at any time, but Naia casually The standing posture, the action is even a little street-like vulgarity and screaming. In her perception, there is no gap in all directions, and it is impossible to launch an attack and even escape. A 14-level killer is actually so close to the state of no-hands-on force, so what is the power of Naa in its heyday? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya did not immediately plan to do it, but still ridiculed the blood parrot, extremely sarcasm: "Hey, look at your posture, ass Why is it so high? Want to seduce me? Although I have earned a lot of extra money recently, how do you know that I have money? Hey, hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned a few more screams, suddenly the tone sank, put away the exaggerated rough and wretched, said coldly: "Blood parrot, just rely on your goods, dare to run into the dark blue wild? Well, who is the master messenger behind you, let me go when you say it. If you want to be hard, I don't mind practicing some techniques that have been used for a long time! Hello, Richard, you can stand up. Don't be so nervous, here is my place, she can't move your finger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common way for Richard to come up, but not Instead, it is traversed to the corner of the wall, then attached to the wall like a lizard, and then stood up. The whole movement is swift and unparalleled, and the direction of action is incomparable. If someone suddenly attacks during the standing process, then most of them will fail because of judgment errors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of Richard made Naia very satisfied, and the blood parrot was surprised first, then suddenly, in a hoarse voice, said: "The disaster blade, you put yourself The art of assassination has all been taught to Richard? No wonder they will fail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya shook his head in dissatisfaction and snorted, saying: "What is it all to teach him? Hey, now he is only a little bit of fur, just can't talk about the art of assassination! But this little guy is learning fast and serious, always forgetting to be alert, very much a day. But dear blood parrot, are you delaying the time? Didn't you find that I was also delaying the time? Here is my site, you are calling more reinforcements and can't escape my palm..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a very angry and imposing voice in the distance: "Her reinforcements have been cleaned up by me, and yours is also! To correct you, here is the dark blue, the place where your Highness is! You are standing on the site of your Highness. , It would have to pay tax "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; would have sent massive sound move, but only now reaching the enforcement group Master real scene finally appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood parrot's body suddenly vibrated, but still dare not change the posture of the crouching. She found that as soon as she moved a little, she would immediately inflict a fatal attack on Naia. At the end of the roadway, a small but extremely imposing figure emerged, which is the gray dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of Black Gold comes from the law enforcement group mages who are behind them, and the number is more than one dozen. Moreover, the mages were protected by more than ten heavy-loading knights. The large pieces of these steels are incomparably powerful, all of them are heavy weapons, and they are powerful in the street fighting. Naa will also have a headache, not to mention that there are dozens of firepower mages behind them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Steps dragged three bodies and walked with two men. It was the two men Richard had seen in the taverns of Naia, but they were very captive, but they were very relaxed. Because Black Gold is really only to collect taxes, and paying taxes is a matter of Naa, they have no income. As for the three bodies, the blood parrots waited for the reinforcements. Unfortunately, the brain was not very flexible, and they dared to resist. So they immediately became corpses, and they failed to cause even a little casualty to the gray dwarf troops. In frontal combat, the killer is completely a tragedy compared to the regular army armed to the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the gray dwarf led the lineup, not to mention the accomplices of the three blood parrots, that is, the partners of the 30 Naa have to flee, and the lineup of escape also includes Naa itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the gray dwarf appeared, the smile on Naa’s face really turned into a sultry smile, but it seemed a bit embarrassing and bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf’s eyes flashed with dangerous light, saying: “You taught Richard only the fur, not the essence of the assassination of art. 1000 gold coins a day? You have to know that you can finally get the money of your Highness! Your Highness... Money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya looks smirk and puts gray The dwarf pulled aside and lowered his voice and said, "I wasn’t bragging? You see, Richard can now clean up four killers alone. How could it be just fur? It’s the essence of my years of experience! So the tuition fee It’s very reasonable, and I paid taxes last month. You bring so many people, this is...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf is also pressing Pressing the sound, I glanced at the blood parrot and said, "I heard that there is a little trouble here, so I will bring more people to see it, so that you can't cope with it, and hurt the small Licha of His Royal Highness. Who knows it is all Some of these things! What are you going to do with this woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya wrinkles "It's very tricky, I don't know if I can ask for something. Or do you stay and see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I just manage Tax collection, other things have nothing to do with me!" The gray dwarf waved his hands hard and refused. Then he suddenly blinked and said, "And I don't want to hear what she said. If you ask something, deal with it yourself. Do you have your own rules in the dark world?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya double eyebrows are getting tighter and tighter: "But here is dark blue, everything is dominated by dark blue rules..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The gray dwarf waved his hand and violently interrupted Naa's words: "The rule of dark blue is to pay taxes honestly, nothing else! Well, I am gone, remember this month's tax! As for the other I didn’t see anything!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf waved, the squad and the knights immediately threw three bodies and two men on the ground, surrounded by He is rolling away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya's face is a bit gloomy, and the gray dwarf's rude attitude is endorsed by armed forces that can destroy the dark world of the city. Moreover, the demonstrations and warnings of this trip are very obvious. The implication is that they do not need to be placed under the Highness. They are also able to clean up all the people who are under the circumstance, regardless of whether they have been in the world more than a decade ago or outside. What is the nickname of the prestige. Here is dark blue! The dark blue of His Royal Highness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of dialogue until the gray dwarfs leave, the blood parrots keep their ass high and tilted, just like what special hobbies are. Her sloping ground had already been soaked in sweat, but Naa’s murder was always locked on her, making her inorganic. The armed forces led by Black Gold are a more terrible existence than Binaya, and she does not dare to have any extra moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Naya’s gaze fell on himself again, the blood parrot finally knew that there was no luck, screaming, and coming to Naa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snoring sound, Naa’s short knife miraculously appeared in the back of the blood parrot, stunned her. When the blood parrot fell to the ground, Naa also kicked her and kicked her a few times. After confirming the coma, she turned to her and said to Richard: "The next step is to torture her. The process will be very exciting and bloody. You can look at it and even give me a little help, which will help you understand the art of the dark world. But this is not necessary, after all, this content may be too early for you, the impact may be It's too big. So you need to decide for yourself whether you want to participate in the next process. How do you want to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
