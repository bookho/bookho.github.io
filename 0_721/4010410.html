			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Senma led the army to cross the Yonghui barrier, Richard knew that the war it is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardest stage is not a siege legend, but a short moment to hold the Yonghui barrier, with hundreds of people defending such a long line of defense, while at the same time The tens of thousands of Shulan soldiers on both ends of the attack, even if Richard has a geographical advantage, even if the strength of his men is far more than the Shulan people, their hardships are far beyond imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slashed and looked at the countless Hulan people who quit the bridge of the mainland, watching the horses lead the soldiers into the entire fortress, and began to Clearing up the battlefield and searching for hidden enemies, the Shulan battle has been opened. On the way to the nest, there is no such danger as the bridge of the mainland, and with many followers and knights in the open area. On the other hand, Richard has the confidence to defeat the opponent's army of any size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw a scene that he did not want to see. On the entire Yonghui barrier, there were overlapping bodies everywhere, the vast majority It’s the Shulan people, but there are also many elite knights and knights in the knights. Richard closed his eyes and was unwilling to count the number of bodies. This figure is something he didn’t want to face at all, but wisdom and The true talent is cold, and the number of casualties is given without emotion. The elite knights are the best statistics. Just calculate the number of people who can still respond, and you can know how many have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite squad knight who is also able to respond is... eighty-four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number makes Richard feel a little dizzy, but the heart is telling him that this is true, in the most intense moment of the battle, Richard more than once The elite knights were ordered to cover their followers and knights with their own lives. Even so, the knights of the knights died in a total of more than ten rides. There were also many serious injuries among the followers. Later, even Io and Naiyou They all carried the chain and the two priests fought fiercely. It didn't seem to be under the knights, but their real role was not to be melee, but also the hardship of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many times, Richard feels that he can’t move any more, even if it’s a knife, but every moment, Richard feels that he is looking at it. Looking at myself, eyes are from followers, but also from the construction of the knights, even Richard has the illusion that there will be eyes from elite elite knights, Richard knows that as long as they fall, or unable to fight, then these people may finally fight It will disappear, so Richard gritted his teeth and continued to get out of the knife. Even after a knife, he could even make another knife. I don’t know when, the well of the stars will have a force to make Richard regain his vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the knights, Richard seems to be fighting forever, and they will be excited for it, and once again plunged into the battle of forgetting to die, and the knight who is in the battle of death, the Richard who is the leader, will die. I will not give up first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miracle is achieved in this way, and the miracle has never been done by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although miracles have been achieved, the number of casualties still makes Richard feel distressed, but Richard knows that this is the best he can do, even When Gordon was in its heyday, he was unable to step on the Yonghui barrier. Now Richard has captured the fortress that the entire plane claims to be unsettled. It is possible without paying the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to take two steps, but just after a move, the body is reminding him that now the knife is supporting him, not that he is inserting the knife On the ground, at the time of Richard's gaze, Lina was coming in and came to his side. The dragon Master's expression was very complicated, like what he wanted to say, but he said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee’s eyes slowly sweep across the fortress and ask: “Lina, this fortress is hard to beat, but it should not be for Gordon and you. As for how to get it, how come it has been for so long, the battleline is still here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to Gordon, the face of Dragon Master is more complicated, she His eyes fell to the side, and he did not dare to touch Richard’s line of sight. He said in a smooth voice as follows: "At that time, Gordon was not able to attack the Yonghui barrier, but was reluctant to construct the knight in his hand. There are two legendary strongmen. On the same day, we had a serious injury. We injured one and ran another, but there were losses. And Shulan had no special products at all. There is no resource with special value. We don’t know What did the whole plane play down? In addition, Gordon’s adults didn’t have much money. Losing a few knights, it took a lot of time to make up, and you are different.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s words mean that Gotton is far from Lee. This kind of wealth is so thick that you can easily pull out the rider of the rider, and you can lose more than a dozen rides in a decisive battle. Gotton can't afford such a loss, and the elite knight is in the eyes of Lina. It is also rare and elite, but it lost a lot in this battle. This is definitely a huge loss. On the other hand, Lina also has some complaints about the defeat of Richard. In her eyes, Shulan is only one year. Stable to produce a million-dollar income, in addition to no value, Richard's loss in this battle, even if it accounts for the full plane, I am afraid it will have to be compensated for decades or even hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in Noland, a common sense of warfare that almost everyone knows. The starting point of the indigenous people considering war is life and death, while the Noelde superior needs to think about input and output, not to occupy the entire plane. In order to succeed, in most cases, it is a wise choice to take advantage of a part of the plane and then turn to the defense, and then open up a new plane. Because the plane conquers a certain stage, the investment will rise straight. But the harvest does not increase much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why there is such a strange feeling that Richard is defeated, Lina did not think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lina hurriedly looked away, she discovered that Richard did not know when she had passed out. She panicked and began to look for the gods in the world. Both Nai and Yu were arrested by her. They almost went to Richard. The two priests examined it for a long time before they announced that Richard would not have anything. It was just too much injury and excessive physical exhaustion. The sacred eyes of the priests, Lina is helpless, only to face them fiercely, can not lose momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel and Naiyou looked at each other with a smile on their heart. What the hell was, they also let Lina clearly see her smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Red Dragon Caro almost flew in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard woke up, the entrance was completely unfamiliar, the ceiling was a strange wooden, painted with a rich and exotic mural, he thought After a while, I realized that I should be lying in the fortress bridge of the mainland on the Shulan side. Richard struggled to sit up from the bed and accidentally discovered that the wounds on his body were close to healing, and there was a feeling of tingling everywhere. He only had a simple magical treatment, and the wound was so fast that it was caused by the resilience of the Hydra lizard. Richard tried to move and felt that there was no dark wound left on his body, and he let go of his heart. The heart was loose, and immediately the thunder was heard in the belly, and the huge hunger controlled him, so that he could not wait to give up the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Qian reluctantly controlled himself and stumbled to the door, calling the guards to deliver the food at the fastest speed. The first batch was bread and smoked. The meat was immediately cleaned by Richard, but this thing only made Richard feel more hungry. He immediately urged the guards to send more food. If he added five meals in a row, Richard took a dozen. The brawny's appetite was swept into the abdomen, and it was barely feeling that he had eaten half full. He still had hunger, but his stomach was completely filled, and his super digestion ability was too late to eliminate so many foods. Now Li The hunger is actually the thirst for energy everywhere. Looking at the empty dishes at the table, Richard is very fond of the deep blue and royal foods that are extremely energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
