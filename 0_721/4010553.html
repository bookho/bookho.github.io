			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most direct collision between the two forces, strong and weak. Darui’s face was smirked at first, but suddenly it turned into extreme horror. He suddenly opened his mouth and wanted to call, but he couldn’t say anything. A blood spurted out, and the dark green inspired by the conflict of power. The ball of light also suddenly lost its balance, and all the way down to the big Druid, the big Druid retired a few steps, but also spewed a large blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee popped up the magic shield, and underestimated the blood that was sprayed on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proverbs Druid stared at Richard with a grudge and said: "The elders are no longer good, no strong people are sitting, I see you still What are you relying on?" After that, the hunters of the same family hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline looked at Richard, she was already shocked and couldn’t speak. Although she had been with Richard for a long time, she knew that her temper was not good. And the young outsiders who can always find hidden paths are actually powerful, but they never think that they will be strong enough. His opponent is the big Druid of the 18th level, but from the perspective of the situation, Richard is simply grinding. Pressed, isn't Richard not just a sacred standard as he himself said, but actually has reached the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally saw Melin’s face, and smiled and said: “It’s just that, I’m not that powerful.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Li said can not be said to be wrong, his magic is actually similar to the natural power of the great Druid, that is, strong and strong, but Richard has mastered 1024 rules. It is not surprising that there is a very strong gram in the natural power of the Greenson plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline thought that Richard had any special overdraft to stimulate the power, and the heart was a little more peaceful, she has always been very proud, as the Yongye tribe A generation of women in the forest, looking at the guardian elves, the young people are better than her, but Richard is an alien. When he is with him, Mei Lin always feels like Like a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline was comforting herself, but she did not expect the voice of the elders to come suddenly: "If the rules of comprehension are also clever, then there is no speculation. The behavior is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this was said, Mei Lin was shocked and looked at Richard incredulously. Richard’s heart was also awkward. He himself was driving the magic, and it was actually seen that the power of the rules was used. This means that the elders must have mastered. Rules, and definitely above themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, come to me." The elders' tone was slightly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not dare to ignore her, such as the strong master who mastered the rules, and in the territory she is familiar with, as long as there is still a breath, It can mobilize the power of the surrounding environment to make a fatal blow, just like a dying beast, a paw can also kill a sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard entered the room, he felt the elder’s gaze through the mask, and looked at himself seriously and looked up and down. The elder's voice suddenly became a little trembling, saying, "Young people, show me the knife behind you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took down the elf knife and handed it over. This knife was given to him by Gordon, and he did not say that there was any origin. For a long time, the elf There is no additional killing attribute on the long knife. If it is special, it will never damage this item. It is only this one that is enough to make the elf long knife into the legend. After that, it is strengthened by the tree of life. The elf long knife has added more natural power attack, which can be regarded as a quasi artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elders of the Yongye tribe will certainly not put a quasi-artifact in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders took a long knife and stroked the blade one inch and one inch. The body’s trembles even Meilin could see it. It was obviously extremely excited. She suddenly closed her eyes. Looking up, it doesn't move. It seems that she is trying to calm her mood. When she opens her eyes again, her eyes are clear and she is stabbed in Richard's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heartbeat has suddenly risen, and he has not only thought about it, but has directly inspired all the magical protection that can be cast. He has inspired the hot talent and has the magic. The magical skills of the reincarnation, so almost every second can be instant two or three magic protection, in a blink of an eye, a dense magic protection and a variety of gains make people scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders snorted and sat still, the rifle did not know when it had arrived, and then the electric light appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the electric light dissipated, Li stood still, did not dare to move a little, the cold sweat on his forehead dripped down, the sharps of the elders long gun, gently point in the throat of Richard, piercing a little bit of skin . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of magical defenses that are as thin as paper in front of the elders, and they are pierced with a shot. This gun has nothing special to say. The speed is particularly fast, the power is particularly cohesive, but when it comes to the extreme, there is an invincible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart is jumping wildly, this gun can’t be hidden, and it’s impossible to prevent it. It’s only hard to fight with her, but now Li Inspect, even the elders and the elders have no qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this knife?" The elder asked slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Melin rushed: "The Great Elder, Richard is my friend, he saved me several times."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders only raised their hands and let Melin dare not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the mind, Li has turned over countless thoughts in an instant, and then honestly said: "It was given to me by my father. He did not say the origin of this knife. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father's name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the elders is a bit strange, Richard hesitated for a moment, still answering: "Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gordon...it was him..." The voice of the elders is very weird, the whole The momentum of the people suddenly fell, and it seems that sitting is somewhat unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaben wants to test and ask "you know him.", but then I found out that the elders are low-spirited, but the murder is getting more and more. Putting it back in the belly, the perception is quietly released, ready to escape the route, he has regretted more than once, should not be so close to the elders, at this distance, Richard’s escape is not even enough, most of the body When you move, you will be shot by a big elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom has calculated the result, and Richard’s only vitality at this moment is in the treatment of the elves’ secret swords, and he must have a hard shot. The power of praying for prayer can make Richard not die, then there is hope of escape, but more than half of it may be that Richard was shot by a great elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders were silent, their eyes continued to go back and forth between the elf long knife and Richard, and they said for a long time: "The knife has no special attributes. The only natural attack should be attached to the tree of life here not long ago. The intruders who built the plane portal and captured a tree of life are yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders asked again: "There is nothing surprising about this knife. With your current ability and the power of Gordon, why not make it better?" Knife, this does not seem to be difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard was silent for a moment, then said: "This knife is the father left me with not many relics. First, although I do have better weapons on hand, I am still used to bringing it with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relics." The elders whispered Exclaimed, unbelievable: "Gordon is dead, that bastard... How can the bastard die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved Mellin back and then I eagerly asked: "How did he die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he would tell the story of Vatican’s own day, and he did not know whether Gordon was How to die, just know that the volcanic man is no longer alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders were silent for a long time, only sighed and whispered: "The deepest part of the world... Oh, unfortunately, I can’t go anymore... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard couldn’t figure out whether the elders and Gordon were enemies or friends, but her murder has not been weakened. At the same time, Richard kept the state of alert. When he was not careful, several young grasses were born on the floor of his feet, and white flowers were instantly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This obvious change naturally falls into the eyes of the elders. She is shocked all the time, but she does not immediately attack as I expected, but stares at the few plants. Xiaohua, ask: "When you believe in prayer, where did you learn from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...the father taught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gordon." The elders snorted and said: "This bastard does not have a high elf bloodline at all. It seems to be a prayer of a simulated monthly force to teach you. Oh, it’s amazing, but it’s not surprising what happens to that bastard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the elders fell on Richard. This time, the murder was gone, and there was a deep expectation in his eyes. He asked: "Who is your mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question uncovered the long-standing pain of Richard’s deep heart and replied softly: “Mom’s name is Elani, she is an elf.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder's breathing immediately rushed: "Ilani, she is not a silver moon elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she is going Tell me when I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder's body suddenly froze: "Ilani...dead, how could she die, the sacrifice of the moon Life is incredibly long, at least for four or five hundred years, even if she is in the plane of ten times the flow velocity, now she has passed one third of her life. How did she die, tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another memory that Richard does not want to recall. The scene of the flames of the sky has left a pain that never fades in his young heart. India, so he used just a few words, too, at that time through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Richard was not very clear about the reasons why Ilani did this, but the elders seemed to understand, and sighed heavily, saying: "It turns out that you are the child of Elannie and Gotton. I really didn't expect it... It's not surprising that Ilani made such a decision, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She waved to Richard and said, "Go out first, let Meilin take you to find a place to rest, I need to be quiet, and you will come back to me at this time tomorrow."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the log house, the two doors closed behind him and closed the figure of the elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline had already waited outside, and when she came out, she immediately greeted him and hurriedly asked, "How is the injury of the elder, she I said how to resist the Yi language tribe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her anxious look, Richard reluctantly brought up the spirit and comforted: "Don't worry, the proverb is very It’s a good deal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin was anxious: “It’s a good deal, how to deal with it, the elders have already been hurt like this.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
