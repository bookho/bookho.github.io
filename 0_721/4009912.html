			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of the Marquis of Ryan has given him an unusual taste. According to common sense, Gordon should never appear. Even if he is in his own territory, he should be fighting for a different position. As a powerful man with a strong combination and a rare commander, the biggest role is to be on the battlefield. . Like solving the trivial intrusion, the thirteen knights can easily solve three or four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Button not only came in person, but behind him, there are clearly the most terrible of the thirteen knights, Modred. And in addition to this demon king, there are actually seven of the thirteen knights present! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, the lined up knights were nearly fifty riders, and the rest were all elite light cavalry, not heavy attackers who were good at attacking the assault. But in the eyes of the Archimonde family's current combat power, there is no need to ride again, and Gordon has a random assault, and there is almost no line that can't be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Marquis of Ryan feels that his combat power is in front of Archimonde, as fragile as crystal. For almost a moment, he even had a ridiculous thought. Can Gordon not want to swallow him and the invaders of hell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let Ryan feel the incredible second thing happened. When the Hell Portal is about to take shape, the space a few kilometers away is once again distorted, and it is actually a portal to be formed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, almost overlapping coordinate areas, even two different face invasions occurred at the same time? And are they on the edge of the family's most important territory? Visually measure the extent of the second portal and the intensity of the spatial distortion. The impending intruder's strength is almost the same as that of the Devil's Legion. The Marquis of Ryan could hardly believe his eyes. He felt that his body was cold, and the weight of his sword seemed to increase tenfold. He might drop it at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the Marquis suddenly felt that Archimonde’s army was very cordial and deeply grateful for being able to adjoin the Archimonde. The only thing he is worried about right now is that Archimonde has no legendary combat power and is not enough to solve one of the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two portals are formed almost simultaneously, and a large number of devils and demons are separated from the portal. Their striker's front is less than two kilometers away, and they collide together, which is a charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis suddenly felt extremely lucky, but the devil and the devil appeared at the same time! This is not a problem of one plus one equals two, but two races that will kill each other. Perhaps this sudden invasion will be solved like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis raised the sword high and then issued the order: "All attention! On-site defense, no one can attack without authorization, the magician is not allowed to release the spell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone understands the meaning of the Marquis command. When the devil and the devil are very likely to kill each other, any move that provokes their hatred is extremely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil and the devil apparently saw each other, so the devil soldiers quickly became a neat army, and the demons began to roar the demonstration. They are not the human army that has not seen the left and right, but at this moment, the natural hatred makes them only the enemy in their eyes. The battle is on the verge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last step out of the portal is the two devil lords and a demon lord who are significantly larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strange situation happened in the eyes of the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two devil lords saw the opposite demon and immediately gave off a strong breath. But they just stared at the devil, waving their weapons and reaching the order in a row. Then the strict devil's square turned right, marching in a uniform pace, marching forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out to the right, this is the order received by the devil lord, who have no courage to defy the orders of the great lords, so even though the devil is in front, they are still firm The command was executed without doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's little lord glimpsed, the strange movements of the devils made his violent mood calm down a little, and before the departure, Bai Menggao snarled the order that was issued immediately. It becomes very clear in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an order that cannot be defied, although the devil's nature is calling in front of him to rush to kill the past, but opposite the two devil lords, it is estimated to be No good results. He was not willing to look to the right, and the unsettled Archimonde made him feel faint. So he found that there was no other choice, and it was better to follow the orders of the big lord, if he wanted to live more for a while after he went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is said that there is Su Helun on the right, it is a name that makes all the devil lords shudder. Although she did not see her, the demon lord was convinced that the woman who feared the devil must be hiding somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the demon little lord roared loudly, and the snoring spread throughout the battlefield like a thunder! The demons began to turn hesitantly, but the fierce individuals were still unwilling to struggle with the army that wanted to be close to the devil. This provoked the lord's fierceness. He jumped to the back of several guys who didn't listen to the guy, stepped on the two directly, shredded one, and grabbed the last three demons and threw them to the left, which is Ryan. The direction of the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out to the left, no return. This is the death order issued by Bai Menggao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the earth began to vibrate, and the black mist and the flames were wrapped together to form a black cloud of black pressure, rolling in! The devil's snoring sounded like a thunder, and the devil's square was solemn and suffocating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound, the magic sword fell from the hand of Marquis of Ryan, the Marquis was unaware, the consciousness was already blank, and had forgotten to give any orders, just I suddenly looked at the incredible sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has ever imagined that the devil will charge side by side with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the high view, the demon and the devil's legion constitutes a torrent of two colors, and rushed over the ground. This is an enemy that has always been evenly matched in the bloody battle that has not been known for a long time. At this moment, it also shows a considerable fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demons have no formations and rules. When they encounter obstacles, they rush straight up until they tear apart every living enemy. The devil is more like a strict army. The two small lords are both qualified commanders and savage generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, the abyss and the army of hell marched side by side, no one can be faster than anyone else. They are sometimes scattered, sometimes gathered, only one kilometer away from the nearest time, but there has never been a conflict and fighting miraculously, making people think that the bloody battle of the millennium is just a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
