			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more excited Balian is, the easier it is for Richard’s expression, "I have only heard of a guy named Salenville. If the guy is not more than three times as strong as me, he never dares to fight. You seem to be a little better than him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind Balian, there are five hundred iron rides, the number is exactly ten times that of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a battlefield. We are not a war between the two countries. I, Balian, not even Salenwell." He said, then he turned back and said: "I need fifty people to die with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, five hundred riders are Stepping forward a few steps, killing the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only need fifty people." Balian roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred rides, look at me, I look at you, everyone will not give up, and finally the commander will come out and shout: "All The knights with the title are out of the ranks, and all the officers are listed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, finally succeeded in reducing the number of knights to more than 50 rides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balian turned back to Richard and slammed his chest and said: "Now our numbers are equal, Richard, come on." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and down at the opponent, the young knight is only sixteen, in Faro, it is not easy to reach the 16th level at this age. This is just the case. Just relying on a group of **-level knights, I want to fight hard with Richard. Without other people, Richard can kill the 50 people on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently tapped the scabbard of the elf knife and asked, "You...is really stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and said, "This is true, I can’t really say the word confidence, in me. It seems that you are too confident to be too stupid. Just hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the wrath, Balian was so full of burning vindictiveness, blushing and bright, like the first light of the morning sun. He pulled the sword forward and screamed: "Kill,."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill." Fifty riders screamed and screamed and rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for them to rush within 30 meters, Richard slowly instigated the horse, behind the three gods, the splash and the elite knight are also forward, neat as one Machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron and steel torrent of the Iron Triangle Empire slammed into the iron wall of Richard, and then splashed like a spray, and the iron wall was safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Richard’s position is Balian, his elf long knife instantly hits Balian’s waist and gently picks him away. The ride, flying high in the sky, a hedge, all the Knights of the Iron Triangle Empire have all fallen, only Balian is still flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a muffled sound, Balian fell heavily on the ground, and suddenly said nothing could climb, the rest of the knights he brought were agitated, but they were patient. Did not rush over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty to fifty, this is not the battlefield, this is a duel, the fair duel is the most sacred thing, although they are the hands of Balian, but if it is rushing If you come up to help, it is like slap in the face of your own master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barian only feels whirlwind, the roar of the brain is hard to calm down, struggling to open his eyes, slamming, the spirit of Richard A long knife stuck his cheek into the ground and then slowly pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barian shakes his head a few times and looks around. He sees the knights he has chosen to squat on the ground, and some are still struggling. Some of them were motionless, life and death were unknown, and Richard's knights were neatly arranged in a row. It looked like there was no one. Balian knew that he had not lost, and he had lost to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Richard returned to the shackle and turned to the magic ride. He greeted him: "Go." He took the lead to the line of the national border. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balian did not know where to come from, and stood up and said: "Why not kill me,"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant voice of Richard has drifted over: "I don't kill the boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a boy, I am an adult, my name is Bally. Ann." He tried his best to get these three words, but Richard had already gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the magic ride is excellent, all the way away, and soon crossed the border line and entered the territory of the deep red duchy. On the way, the sand drifted to Richard: "It seems that you care about that kid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I think he may be more threatening than Saranwell in the future."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Saranwell has more than a thousand cavalry, but he dare not play." Liu Sha asked, "But I think he did not do anything wrong, as smart as he is." The guy must be able to see that if you start the war, you will lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is a smart guy, always." Perhaps it is remembered When he first arrived at Faro’s hard years, Richard sighed and then smiled at the sand. “But I’ve never been afraid of this clever guy. I’m only worried about the so-called idiots or madmen because they sometimes Knowing that you are losing, you will also go to fight, such as the boy behind us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We Where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the northwest direction: "Go to the ancestral highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The war there doesn't seem to require you to intervene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we are not going to war, but going on vacation." Richard smiled and said, then said : "After laying down the temple of the high gods of war, we should fight the gods in full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you still have no way to take their god country." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "But I can burn all the temples in the world. I am going to attack the Great God of War, this is to let the gods see I am offended, what will happen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people speed up and rush to the ancestral highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that the war with the gods was inevitable, especially when he discovered the god of courage after secretly cultivating the gods, except for Xerxes. In addition, Richard does not know which gods are quietly cultivating the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods seem to be omnipotent, but it is only for the creatures in the plane, such as the magic masters such as Richard across the plane, behind the magical dark blue, but also from the Faro thousand magic The civilized Noland, the gods do not know more than he knows in some areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, can never be controlled, destruction and betrayal are their nature, which is the root rule rooted in their strength, just because The power of the rules, they are so powerful, once there is a god in the plane of the continent that can adapt to the rules, then the entire Faro will eventually fall into the dark age, become the dark and cold death, the ultimate period of the gods It can be so large that it can cover the whole continent. In the last drop of nutrients in the dry surface, the gods will also die. The crystal wall of this plane will disintegrate and return to become a part of nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god is the ultimate weapon of the god war, but it is actually a double-edged sword, destroying the enemy and destroying itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not aware of whether the Faroese gods know this, but it may not be known to them, otherwise it is difficult to explain the behavior of cultivating the gods, or At least for now, he has not found the reason why the gods want self-destruction. Even in Noland, the gods are a fascinating existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard suddenly found that his war became meaningful, and in order to prevent the gods from dragging the entire Faro into the stupidity of destroying the abyss, he had to I chose to go to war, but from another point of view, he is a conqueror from the ectopic plane. Now the meaning of war has become a life-saving creature. It is ironic to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the return of Richard, the entire deep red Principality took action, and a branch left the station and moved to the Zuyuan Heights. This time, Li mobilized Up to 80,000 expeditionary troops were recruited, and a large number of reserve soldiers were also recruited and armed. They went to the border with the human countries. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard was 50,000 in the border of the Iron Triangle Empire, and 30,000 in the border of the Sequoia Kingdom and other countries. The significance of deterrence is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of the Iron Triangle Empire, the heroic flag of Anrekala was raised, and the direction of other human beings was the flag of the Tomahawk of Gangde. It’s two chilling names. Anrekara’s soldiers are ever-changing and invincible. His elite knights are simply invincible, while Gangde is another style. He is more like a matchless veteran. He likes to be the most in battle. In front, always rushing in the first line, there is such a master, the army he brought out does not have to say, all of them are not afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
