			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knights on the castle are falling down one by one. Although each town bear knight will pull at least a few times the enemy to go to the country of death, but the town bear knight is a quasi-construction knight, is irreplaceable elite. Their strength and loyalty are unquestionable. What is Richard’s death? Barbarians, sand people, indigenous warriors, and captive knights are all resources that have been plundered from this plane. Only a few stepping knights are brought from Noland. However, in the mind of Sinclair, the ten stepping knights together are not as important as a town bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated, although the blue moonlight on her body had faded before, but the burning pain of the wound began to ease at this moment, and the pale golden fire was fading. Doesn't exist, and when the activity ability is restored, does she first kill or catch Richard, or save a few town bear knights? On the ectopic side, if there is no loyalty, development will be extremely difficult. She does not have the grace of the Eternal and the Dragon of Time, and she is not willing to waste precious life on the low-lying ectopic face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the lion's body began to lie low, and a green flame was exhaled in the nose, like a terrible enemy hidden in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Sinclair hesitated, a giant wolf began to jump out of the fog. They were like real wolves, and they could not run around the lion. , issued a low bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torrent of the wolves suddenly paused for a moment, but what followed was not a swarm of slams, but an overwhelming wind blade, attacking 蝎lion. For the lions, the power of these wind blades is very limited. At most, only a small wound can be cut on the body, and even the thick skin can not be completely cut through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of giant wolves is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair swept away and knew that at least three hundred giant wolves had surrounded themselves. It is now clear that these giant wolves without souls must have been commanded, and maybe it is Richard on the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blade is getting denser and denser, and finally splashes like a lion to the lion. The huge lion screams with anger and screams, always slamming, tearing a head with a giant claw. It has the equivalent of 16th-level combat power, and it is a single blow to deal with the seven-level wind. However, the lion was obviously afraid of warning, and did not dare to let go and kill the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair finally decided to leave this damn place first, she grabbed the lion's mane and shouted, "Little baby! Kill them, then we Leave here! Fast!...... ah, no, my god, what is that!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the less than 100 meters ahead, the rich fog to both sides Arranged, an incomparably huge shadow came slowly. Even though Sinclair saw a variety of Warcraft, but saw a giant worm that is six or seven meters high and nearly 30 meters long, can not help but stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the mother nest, the lion is like a tame kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion can of course not be a cat. It got rid of the wolves and suddenly rushed to the nest, and jumped to the back of the nest. , the claws dig into the hen's back shell! In its perception, this is the most threatening enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back shell of the mother's nest is harder than steel, but it does not have much blocking effect on the claws of the lion, and the claws of a root nearly half a meter long are deep. Deep piercing into the hen's back! The lion lion is still unfinished, and the tail needle is also nailed down, and the slamming sound is completely out of the mother's nest and the disproportionate head! The deadly venom is injected into the mother's nest in a gushing manner along the opening of the tip of the tip. Less than a second, the venom in the lion's poison sac has been emptied, and the lion's breath is obviously weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So poisonous, it is enough to poison everyone in a large city. The mother's nest was only a little paused in action, and if nothing happened, the lions continued to climb to the dusk castle. It is close to immunity to poison and acid, and it is the nemesis of the lion. The head of the mother's nest has been smashed by poisonous needles, but its pair of short, but extremely sharp and powerful blades are also cut on the tail of the lion's lion, cutting the huge tail needles to the majority! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion screamed for a while, his body trembled and almost fell Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any temptations, the lions used their best in the first attack. Sinclair also has limited commanding ability to the lion. At this moment, she lost all her strength. She can only catch the lion and keep herself from being thrown out. She grabbed the double knife in the other hand and desperately wanted to accumulate strength, but the injury caused by Cyan Yuehua was too hateful. As long as the vindictiveness surged, it would impact the residual monthly force of the wound, boiling and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion slammed on the back of the nest, but never penetrated the carapace of the mother's nest. The brood of the mother's nest here is one meter thick, and the lion must carefully plan for a while before it can dig through the carapace. Unlike the general Zerg, the head of the mother's nest is only filled with a mouthpart and a few eyeballs. It is not affected at all. That is not the key, but a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding wind suddenly stopped running again, and then opened the mouth of the lion on the back of the nest! The lion's whole body was erected, and immediately wanted to jump and escape, but suddenly felt an indescribable tingling in consciousness, and with some indescribable pressure, so it was soft. Stumbled on the back of the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mental impact of the Brood, and its full blow can only make the Lions move for a few seconds, but the short delay is at this moment. But it is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, no!!" Sinclair only screamed and immediately buried himself in the lion's mane. The next moment, she felt that if there were countless swords crossed from her back, the pain and fear made her scream hysterically. She was in a hurry, throwing a double-knife roundabout, and cut a piece of wind in the place where she passed, but the fight between the grudge and the monthly force seemed to throw her from head to toe into the boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than three hundred wind blades that cover the mother's nest as a storm. Nearly half of the wind blades fall on the huge body of the mother's nest, cutting out numerous shell fragments, or the folds of the abdomen. The other half of the wind blade was plowed from the lion and the singer. In the gust of wind, countless mane, black blood, broken armor, and hair fluttered with the wind, and then the black blood of the canopy spewed like a fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair fell with his hands, fell from the back of the lion, and slammed on the ground, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion screamed in pain and slid from the nest. Many of the wind blade's damage to it is not too heavy, but the number is too much, it can be described by the skin and flesh, just bloodshed can cause it to die. The pain made the lion mad and fearful. It even dropped Sinclair and wanted to escape alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Block it!" Richard and the mother's nest simultaneously ordered. Then the wind-toothed winds that used the ability of the wind blade surged up like water, and they rushed to the lion lion, biting it, and they would die if they died! Their teeth and claws could not break the lion's defense in one bite, but effectively prevented its escape. On the body, dozens of lions were hanged in an instant, and the speed dropped. The lion screams fiercely and returns to a fierce battle. It shreds a headwind in a second, which is completely slaughtering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watch on the castle looked far away at the most critical battlefield, and saw the lion lion finally stopped, so the order was cold and underground: "the mother's nest , acid vomit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
