And he himself moved like a shadow to the body of the killer. The killer's limbs have all left the control of the central nervous system, but they can still think hard when they are shocked. When he sees himself flying through the alley, he suddenly thinks of the companions hidden inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the muffled sound, the two daggers stabbed into the killer's body at the same time. One pierced the heart from the gap between the ribs, and the other pierced into the spine from behind. The shot was hot and precise, and the power was a blow, but he was mistaken for the assassination. This is a fatal mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee flashed out from behind the killer, barefooted in the back of the assassin who had saved from the alley, but the hand of the magician revealed Extremely sharp, the assassin's head flew up and fluttered, and the blood spurted out of the neck like a fountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li grabbed his hand and grabbed Gao Fei’s head, then bent over and pushed it out like a ball. The assassin's face still solidified with shock and fear, so that the bones rolled into the depths of the alley, parked in front of a thick shadow, and his eyes were still looking at the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow seemed to be uneasy, and finally twisted slightly, splitting two thin gaps, like the eyes of the beast, and the eyes of the assassin I looked at it. This is just a very slight change, almost undetectable. However, in Richard's vision, it is a set of jumping numbers. This shadow and the surrounding environment are already out of place, and immediately discerned by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cry, a burning fireball flies into the alley and bursts! In a semi-sealed space, the power of the fireball is superimposed several times, and the magical flame of nearly fifty energy levels can be killed for any professional below the age of ten. There was a screaming scream in the raging magical flame, and then a burning figure began to dance in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat wave is coming, even in a dozen meters, it seems to be hot and hard. Instead of avoiding it, Richard went into the alley against the heat wave, and then stood close to the wall at the entrance, converging the whole body. His right hand slowly lifted up and his palms pointed at the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gushing heat flow has finally come to an end, and the magical flames are gone, but the semi-coke body deep in the alley is still writhing. The sorrowful is also approaching the end of the whine. At this moment, a thin man appeared from the alley. He looked out into the lane, and the heavy one-handed axe with a handle and a figure in his hand was faintly cold. The first thing he saw was the palm of his hand, and he was beginning to spit the palm of his hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame spurted out of Richard’s hand, just on the man’s face. The man mourned, his face burned, and his eyes were darker, squatting back. The hand of the first-order magical flame with only two power levels is originally a chicken-like magic. It often plays a key role in the wild adventure, but it can also exert great power when used properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stepped back two steps and suddenly felt that the ventral side was cold, so he yelled and the heavy axe went out like a battery, almost sticking to Richard’s The scalp passed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attack of Richard instantly shocked a cold sweat, did not expect men to make such a sharp and accurate counterattack after the eye was hit, and Axe is attached to the axe, at least it is a warrior of ten or more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Li took the opportunity, Li Dun fell down with a weird movement, and then moved to the ground with the lizard crawling position, and it flashed to ten meters in an instant! The decision was incomparably correct. The man’s counterattack was a series of strikes. The heavy axe had been swept over from Richard three times in a row. At the same time, he was constantly adjusting his attack position, which was closer than once. When he was the most dangerous, he even opened the back of him. clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is close to the wall and does not move. His chest was like a burning pain, and the suffocation continually attacked his consciousness, just like the fish on the shore, forcing him to breathe. However, Richard restrained himself, forcing the chest to be like a cracked pain, breathing slowly at a frequency several times slower than usual, so as not to find his own whereabouts by the soldiers who lost their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ability from the blood, the effect of the 'outbreak' has passed, and the consequence of the power of several times in a short period of time is the fatigue of wanting to sleep. Even if it is to drink potent energy to restore the medicine immediately, it will take half an hour to get rid of the gas. In the past half an hour, Richard has almost no mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of Li’s gaze is on the ground in front of the soldier’s feet, only to observe his actions with the light. This is a little trick in the dark world, which avoids the direct vision of the eye to alert the observed person. At the same time, Richard silently calculated his magic power, his body was almost collapsed, and he used magic in a very short time before. The remaining magic is only enough to send out a normal power of fireball. However, for soldiers of level 10 or above, the power of fireballs below 10 levels is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior apparently stayed after a few axe cuts. He didn't think that his continuous slaughter would all fall through. Although his eyes were already paralyzed, his perception and skill were still there. With the memory of the attacker's final position and the sense of being attacked, the speed and avoidance direction of the opponent can be judged. His combo skills have clearly blocked all possible escape paths, and one of them has even touched each other! Still failed? Unless Richard is crawling like a lizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his breath and slowly turned around, ready to find out where the damn kid was hiding. However, the body moved a little, and suddenly the ventral side felt cool again. A crack with a length of forty centimeters appeared, and the blood, intestines, and other pieces that could not be clearly smashed. The warrior swayed, revealing an incredible look, his hands loose, and the heavy axe fell to the ground, and his body fell like a sack of empty space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magical brilliance of the flashing lights has been lit up, the voices are noisy, and the rapid footsteps are quickly and far-reaching. The accident here has alerted the law enforcement mage. . Even in the fringe area, it is taboo to openly cast a range of lethal magic. Fireball is a typical example of range-killing magic. The arrival of the law enforcement mage was obviously a good thing for Richard. He was so relaxed that he breathed out with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of Richard's slack, a sudden hoarse laughter was heard in the ear, and then a seductive female voice almost stuck to his ear. Say: "You can die with peace of mind, Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer himself is not as close as the sound, when her voice is not falling, one The bleak dagger was revealed from the emptiness of the third and fourth steps, and stabbed to Richard's back. The dagger is a strangely dead gray. The poison on the top is not to mention the key to the stab. As long as it can scratch the skin, you can get Richard's life in half a minute. When the dagger is about to meet the heart of Richard, the outline of the killer's body is looming, like a translucent creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was determined to have a blow but failed to succeed, a short knife with a strange shape and a dark red blood, and the first one To, blocked her dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
