			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin closed the book of creation and bearing, gently stroking the cover, for a long time I sighed and handed it to Richard, saying: "I have strengthened the imprint of Scarlet Arbitration. You can use it as needed. You can choose to summon three 16-level, or two 18-level blood color arbitrations. Or is it a 20-level bloody arbitrator, and I am still adding the emblem of my god, which can capture the power of the surrounding and replenish the energy for the summoning, so that every other day, you can re-call the blood color arbitration. Is such a condition sufficient?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took over the book of creation and bearing, silently watching the pages bearing the bloody arbitration mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the bright god emblem added by Martin has a dual role, it can add energy to the pages of the book, but also for Richard to analyze the rules of the gods of light, which undoubtedly let Martin’s chips are a bit thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Richard gradually feels that the help of worldly wealth and materials is getting smaller and smaller. The real core is the rule power, which is a demonstration of the rules. Analysis and control, everything that can help in this area is the most valuable thing, he seems to start to understand the ideas of those super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "The deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin reached out and smiled Asked: "So, alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha still shook his head and said, "No, it’s better to trade, our troubles are big, entangled together. Maybe it will be worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriot smiled and said, "It’s a cautious and smart guy, then these are yours." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Martin untied a necklace in his neck and handed it to Richard, which is another top-level space device with the effect of isolating everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it and felt that there was a half-breasted statue in the necklace space, at the foot of the statue, and a few incomplete magic papers, so Richard nodded and put the necklace away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin got up and said goodbye, "Two months later, I am waiting for your three sets of Midrande."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a no-go gesture. Martin put on the cloak that can cover his face, and left under the leadership of the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Martin left, Richard was not in a hurry to look at the things in the necklace, but to focus on the book of creation and bearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is too thick, can not be put into any space equipment, and the breath can not be blocked, so the number of times Richard used it has gradually decreased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that there is more bloody arbitrator, the book’s effectiveness has improved by a level. If it is still on hold, it seems a pity, and Martin does not know What is the method, even the level of the Scarlet Arbitrator can exceed the current limit of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that Martin has hinted a few times about the supplemental energy, and the way he injected into the bloody arbitration, could not help but sink for a while, then came to the magic in the castle underground. hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee adjusts the magic array to a mode suitable for natural magic, placing the book on the platform in front of it, slowly launching the power of the real name Saron, when After the formation of the Stars Well, Richard launched the real name Raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burst of life-filled milky white mist overflows from the wells of the stars, and Richard’s breath is also spurting with a strong natural and life-like fog. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of creation and bearing began to emit a ray of light, constantly absorbing the fog of life spurted by Richard. On the page, a fairy image gradually became clear. In the heart of Richard, he was delighted. This is the correct way to use the book of creation and bearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked closely at the increasingly well-defined image of the elf wearing a gorgeous white robes, a gold-rimmed robe, two scarlet The ribbon was hung from the shoulders, and although the image was still changing, it was still recognized as a famous white prophet in the Age of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the prophets of the elves, the white prophets are more inclined to heal. They are alone in the power of healing, but they are still inferior to human sacred officials, but they are capable of protracted warfare. The elf who is good at natural forces is far above the human god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two scarlet ribbons indicate that the white prophet has reached the 18th level and became the great prophet, but it is only the case. If the scarlet ribbon can still be darkened with golden world tree branches, each tender The branch means an extra level. If there are two twigs to decorate, it is the 20th-level prophet elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that he has pushed the power of the real name Raven to the extreme, that is to say the 18th-level elf white prophet is his own limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of the mind turns, while maintaining the power of Raven, he begins to strengthen the power of the Saron, and the white mist he breathes begins to reveal greenness, naturally The breath is obviously enhanced, and the image of the elves on the book of creation and bearing changes. The white robe gradually becomes a blue robe, and the scarlet ribbon remains. Only the white gold staff in the hands of the elf prophet becomes a dendritic natural wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves of the Emerald Prophet, another well-known unit of the Elven Empire, they have powerful natural forces, so that their treatment coverage is vast, and the endurance is extremely strong, although The single treatment of the Emerald Prophet is not very powerful, but has an unparalleled advantage in group therapy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like the White Prophet, this Jade prophet also stopped at level 18. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has engraved the next emerald prophet on the page and opened another page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he used the power of destroying his real name on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Desmasson’s power was revealed, a demon image appeared on the page. This demon image is quite strange, unlike other devils recorded in general books. Rough, it is slender, and the three corners of the head are gracefully extended to the sky. If you look at the face, it can even be very handsome, just dark red skin, burning eyes, and anti-joint lower limbs and long tail. Still showing the demon blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised to create a demon, because the blood of Archimonde is derived from the abyss, but the devil on the page is very Peculiar, it is too delicate and elegant, so that it looks like a devil. Because of the chaos and order, the devil and the devil have fought for hundreds of thousands of years. If anyone says that the devil and the devil can be integrated, then Richard The first one does not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the devil on the page does not exist in any record. The more you look at it, the more you feel that you can find more features of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard continued to strengthen the power of Dissmasen, and then found that the images in the pages were more and more inclined to the devil, but when the middle point was reached, the characteristics of the devil were no longer enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a strong interest, this strange demon image now has the equivalent of the sanctuary, and the real name of Des Mason's power can still Continue to improve, the power from the blue moon has not moved yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly added the monthly power of the blue moon to the ruin, and the devil in the page changed, and its eyes turned blue. There are also some cracks in the body. Through the crack, you can see the blue flame inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the blue moon reaches its peak, the page suddenly changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is suddenly disillusioned, turned into four blue light spots, and then four light points are connected in pairs to form a regular tetrahedron, slowing down in the void Rotate slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard checked, he couldn’t see what it was. The front tetrahedron was completely unspeakable as a summoning creature, more like a Alchemy creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of this thing, whether or not to obey the control, Richard knows nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the final formation, Richard could not get the slightest information. It can only be judged from the order of the previous ones, but it should be stronger than the original demons. How strong is 19 or 20, but still has no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stopped the power to destroy the real name, and the strange tetrahedral creation on the page was stabilized, and it floated on the page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha closed the book of creation and bearing, took out the magical recovery and physical recovery medicine, continued to drink several bottles, rested on the back of the chair For a moment, it feels better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to continuously launch a real name is huge, regardless of whether you start your real name or use regular power, it is a total consumption of mental strength, magic and physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another use of the sacred structure. If you use the structure, you can save the consumption of pre-mobilizing the rule power, and only consume the ability to use it. The part, which makes the owner's ability to continue to increase, and the rule power represented by the holy body is not controlled by all legendary powers. After all, in the whole history, such as the soul of Richard Hunters are also very rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
