			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, the barbarian warriors have entered the dream one by one, and the buzz has come one after another. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is full of thick clouds, the wind is very strong, and it is snowing again. It is a good time to kill people. A team of holy temple warriors is taking a step back. Come and turn around in the camp of the warriors. Seeing that there is nothing wrong with this, I walked to the holy temple. The size of this team of warriors is very high. There are several senior warriors in the team, and even one team. As an elder, it can be seen that the Holy Temple attaches importance to this ritual. In the past, there was never such a thing. If the soldiers who participated in the ceremonies were concealed, they could only blame their own skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind of Richard is an ethereal, lying on the bed, the body is in the best state of relaxation, and you can see a stunning red mans flash in the dark. That is Richard’s knife in repeated practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the darkness in Richard’s room tonight is quite different, it seems to have a sticky taste, and there are so many shadows in the room. They all came alive, continually writhing, and they were turning around around Richard. They were all shadow creatures, but now they are in a state of confusion and confusion. They don’t feel the strong atmosphere of Richard. It is like an ordinary person, but instinctively does not want to get close to Richard, especially when the red awns at the fingertips of Richard are lit up, all the shadow creatures are actually retreating, but the red awns are destroyed, they It is slowly approaching Richard, which is the instinct of the shadow creature hunting entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has set a hidden magic trap at the door, on the window, and on the roof. For barbarian warriors, these magic traps can serve as an early warning. But in the eyes of the real dark, the little tricks are useless, but Richard is like a natural trust in the magic traps, so he has concentrated on the knife in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, a black shadow that has disappeared on the roof of Richard’s roof, and the eyes are swept away, all around the roof. The magical alarm, holding a matt short sword in his hand, the blade front seems to be alive, constantly writhing, if you close your eyes to perceive, even the sanctuary will feel the roof of Richard No one can see that the ability of this person to hide the breath has reached a very high level. Each of his movements can be ingeniously integrated with the surrounding environment. Although he has not used stealth, it has almost the same effect as stealth. It is the high-level realm of the killer. If you use stealth, it is easier for the strong to perceive the abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly to the edge of the roof and was about to fall. He suddenly collapsed and slowly looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the not too far, there is a man in his early thirties sitting on the roof. He is very ordinary, not tall, and placed in the crowd. It will be forgotten immediately, but the mellow and soft feeling of his body is coming from the face, so that the surrounding places become like the early spring, this man suddenly appears like this, if not seeing him with his own eyes, Richard roof The killer did not know that there was still a person sitting there. The killer’s eyes passed a trace of sorrow. He clearly remembered that he had never seen such a man before he saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man doesn’t seem to see the killer, but he seems to see it, but he doesn’t care. He just sits on his knees and looks at the thick clouds in the night sky. It seems that the rules of the plane can be seen from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer hesitated for a moment, his eyes flashed through the cold, he had been confessed before he came, this matter has been acquiesced by the Snow Mountain Presbyterian Church, so how to do it It doesn't matter, he bites his teeth and ignores the mysterious man who suddenly appears. If he jumps like a blue smoke, he is ready to break through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is still watching the night sky, just shook his head in a unknowingly, muttering: "I have to go looking for boring, why bother?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is not too big or too small, just to let the killer hear, all the actions of the killer are undulating, but the man’s words let him He almost fell asleep, but he was also a gloomy person, and his heart was straight, and he simply rushed into the room of Richard. However, as soon as he rushed in, the killer suddenly felt that the darkness around him had become thick and sticky, let him The action was greatly hindered, and there was a strong sense of danger coming from all around, but for a moment I could not see what was attacking him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer thought of the electric turn, suddenly remembered something, almost screamed out: "shadow creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It’s really a shadow creature, and it’s a lot. The whole room is a fierce shadow creature. The shadow creature has an instinctive detection of life. When the killer appears, it immediately attracts the attention of all shadow creatures. Wrapped around the siege, the killer was shocked, the short sword swept around, and instantly cut several nearby shadow creatures into pieces, but the killer’s eyes suddenly lit up a little bright red light, and the light was approaching at an incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, the shadow of death is shrouded in the heart of this killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cold all over the body, and then screamed, knocking out the window at a faster speed than before, and fled in the desert. He disappeared into the night, and the movement was not small, and he was shocked by many barbarians nearby. They, they all went out to check out, naturally can't see anything, the man sitting on the roof has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Richard didn’t get up at all, just reached out and killed his finger. This is not a big move, but it’s full of life. The essence of the killer is that the strength of the killer is too strong. If he feels wrong, he will immediately withdraw, but he will not be able to chase after Richard. However, Richard just wants to scare him away. His whole mind is in the upcoming battle. I don't want to be distracted by these trivial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining shadow creatures gathered again to Richard, and the red mans flashed a few times in the room, sketching out a complicated pattern, and by the way The shadow creatures are all shredded, so if the powerful killer can't succeed, Richard believes that there should be nothing tonight, and the killer will not have much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic trap that Richard placed outside the room is only the first line of defense. The intention is to relax the enemy’s warning. The real defense and vigilance are actually those that he summoned. Shadow creatures, shadow creatures are inherently sensitive to life. The usual hidden means have no effect on them. They can only be deceived, but they will not be smashed. Therefore, Richard uses the murderous murder of life and the camouflage of his breath. They make them hesitate, and at this moment, the sudden killer is like a flame in the dark, immediately attracting the attention of all the shadow creatures. In this case, the shadow life is the best alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red awns in the room faded away, and the broken shadows suddenly condensed in one place, and then turned into a normal-sized shadow drill, which fell into the hands of Richard. When Richard looked at the unexpected gain and smiled, he put it in his pocket. The last action of the killer was a bit strange. It was no longer the perfect hiding at the beginning. It is reasonable to say that this is a mistake that should not be made. Richard thought for a while, but couldn't understand it, so he put it aside and continued to practice his own knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in the camp of the Holy Tree Dynasty, the Archbishop of China was gloomy and examined the injury of a skinny man who was going to assassinate Richard. The killer, he didn't have too much injury on his body, it was just a little bit of flesh and blood, but the dozens of smashes that were caught by the shadow creatures were gone. The little scarlet on the throat made people look shocked, like This level of strength, but was injured in this part, regardless of the size of the injury, the situation is bound to be extremely thrilling, the Chinese wave sprinkled a little bit of light, easily dispel the shadow power in the killer wound, while asking in detail In the case, I did not let go of every detail. When I heard the man who suddenly appeared, the Chinese face suddenly changed, and I kept asking, after a while, the Chinese bishop only bit his teeth and spit out a name: "Tibetan sword." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
