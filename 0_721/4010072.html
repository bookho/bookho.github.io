			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris throat movement moved and swallowed a hard time. It’s hard to see everything: “End?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well.” Agamemnon has always been cherished as gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, what did I see? That... is that magic?" Nyris looked at Lina. Although the Master of the Dragon has been crumbling, it does not detract from the glorious image in the heart of Nyris. In front of Longyan's Longyan Waterfall, he escaped a little slower, even if it is a sanctuary, it will instantly turn gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Longyantian Waterfall, Nris’s life was the first time to suspect his speed of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the magic of flowing sand." Agamemnon's eyesight is obviously stronger than Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at the sand, and for a moment, suddenly remembered something, lost the channel: "Dustbreaking sand?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon nodded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods, it really is..." What really is, Nyris did not say it. Even if it is a prince, there are many words that cannot be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha is a pervert!" Agamemnon made an assertion and inadvertently added the second sentence that Nyris did not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to say that the gods of eternal and timeless dragons are perverted, even if they think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Dragon Master fell from the sky and fell into disarray, the war finally returned to its original track. The war should have been a war for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Ender’s death, the rebels finally collapsed and began to run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Archimonde's warriors proceeded in an orderly manner under Richard's command, clearing up the chasing enemy and encircling the surrendered rebels. It is a matter of time before the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3rd Magic Tower surrendered, and the Master inside closed the Magic Tower Shield, and the fish went out and waited for disposal. The No. 2 Magic Tower experienced a fierce battle. The 100 knights of Archimonde slammed into the magic tower with a magical bombardment. The combination of the Master and the Warrior in the Magic Tower is still very powerful, and the Cavaliers almost rely on human life to pile up a road to the top. When the No. 2 magic tower was captured, it was counted as a magical bombardment on the way to the assault. There were only forty soldiers who survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s plan, this part could have been the biggest casualty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon Carlo did not consume all the power on the magic tower this time, so he still soars in the sky, always rushing to the ground, with claws and fangs Ending the life of a rebel army until the end of the summoning time, it will not grow up and scream and disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall situation has been determined, but Richard did not command, but let the officers go to clean up the battlefield. He dismounted and went to Lina. When Master Long fell from the air, he fell to the ground and the personnel were not saved. Richard was shocked. After careful inspection, he discovered that the Dragon Master was only excessively consumed by the magic, and that he let go of his heart. But how can Lina control her magic and consume so much? After all, she is a big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard looked up and looked at the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand quietly spit out the tongue, and the small mouth moved silently. Richard looked at the lips and knew what she was saying: "It’s just a little punishment for this old woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this sentence, you can read a lot of things . But Richard could only helplessly shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magical over-exploited Dragon Master finally woke up, he found himself lying in the city of the Emerald City, where she should have been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sat on the edge of the bed with a charming smile and said, "It seems that my luck is better, not as much as six days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina is just a sly look at Richard. Richard was somewhat inexplicable. He touched his face and found nothing on it. Then he asked, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Dragon suddenly turned a blind eye. Said: "Suddenly think... No, no, nothing. Since the rebellion has subsided, you can go back, there is me here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't understand Why did Lina suddenly become so depressed, and she did not know how to comfort herself. But a strong man like the Great Magister is very clear about what he should do. So he just sat for a while, and when Lina didn't say anything further, she left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to go back to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Richard took the quicksand and the two sons who could not get Wu Xun to leave the Greenson plane. When leaving, of course, I brought some special products of this plane, a kind of wood with excellent toughness and strength. This is a good material for making long bows. It is placed in Noland, which is worth about tens of thousands of gold coins. But if it is Faro, it is more than ten thousand gold coins. The best part is that this is a common substance, without a half-point magical property, so after loading into the space equipment, there is almost no additional cost through the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Liusha first entered the portal, then two young people. However, before stepping into the portal, Niris couldn't help but ask Agamemnon once again: "Is this really over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A war like this, shouldn't we be the protagonist?" Nyris asked unwillingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question, even Agamemnon can't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only role of their two in this plane journey was to help Richard drag a few tons of wood back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned to Noland, the goods promised by the royal family had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately rushed to the warehouse, the castle warehouse is now tightly guarded, not only the guards of Gotton are guarding, but also a whole team The Royal Guard is stationed there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warehouse, there are ten large magic boxes with one person and one person. The Royal Guards captains opened one by one and handed in the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six swords in the box containing all the long swords that are neatly arranged. The magical light shining above and the chill of the forest indicate that this is a The magic sword with the sharp and cold effect is added to the batch, and it is made of Lafite iron, which is stronger than the ordinary high carbon steel. There are fifty non-sheathed swords in each magic box, and the thick wind of whale oil is applied to the sword front to protect the sword and the magic from losing. The six boxes are three hundred magic swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
