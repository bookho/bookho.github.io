			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also got off the horse, in the strictness of several barbarians Defend the caravans to the red Cossacks. It's not so easy to cast magic on a bumpy horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce Cossack cavalry called to launch a charge against Richard’s team! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their commanders are prepared to forcibly penetrate the barbarian’s queue and kill the aristocratic teenager wearing the mage’s gown in the opposite direction. In that case, the master’s hand will be lost. Become a loose sand. In the process of collecting slaves, he and the barbarian have fought more than ten or twenty games, so they have confidence in the combat effectiveness of their cavalry. Every year, the red Cossacks have to capture tens of thousands of barbarians from the vicinity of the Zuyuan Heights! The barbarian is a strong and excellent warrior, but the excellent warrior is not an excellent army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cossack commander is determined to let the unbelievable aristocratic kid see what is the army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of cavalry’s full charge is terrible, and the murderous and thunderous hoofs are enough to bring more than half of the barbarian warriors into fear and Panic. Even if the reloaded infantry without rigorous training has arranged the array, it will be inevitable in the face of the cavalry impact. On the battlefield, the array is scattered and means death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Majesty’s knight speeding up the horse in the shortest distance, the commander’s mouth has already produced a bloodthirsty sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard’s face also had a cold smile. The barbarian under his command is an authentic army. Whoever thinks they still retain the habit of tribal fighting will cost a lot. Moreover, the commander also wants to compete with him for the quality of the troops and the command of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cavalry rushed to the highest speed, the throwing soldiers had already thrown the first round of the axe! The roaring tomahawk turned into a rain of death. After a shower of rain, three or forty rides crashed into the ground. At this moment, Richard quickly took out the book of the bearing, and when the pages of the book were turned, the entire 18 violent bears appeared in front of the cavalry charge line, and they were actually lined up! The magical manipulation that this moment shows is art! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! The dull crashing sound continued, and the Cossack cavalry in high-speed running couldn't dodge. He slammed into a huge violent bear. Although all the violent bears were knocked over, the most forward cavalry people even took Ma Fei. Go out, and then fall heavily on the ground, ribs and fractures! The second row of cavalry was pulled by the horses, but they were hit by the third row of cavalry, so there was another impact and cracking of the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent cavalry assault formation was completely in chaos, and at this time, the second, third and fourth rounds of the throwing soldiers have arrived! This is a kind of combat skill that is thrown by the throwing soldiers. It can throw three rounds of flying axe quickly. Although some heads will be sacrificed, it will not be a problem when non-specified coverage is applied to a certain range on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole three hundred and sixty-handed flying axe flew in the sky at the same time, almost a moving dark cloud! When they fell down, only a few rides were left in the coverage area, and they were stagnant. The 18 violent bears summoned by Richard were all killed. At the same time, the three hundred cavalry that launched the assault, now only less than one hundred people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not the first time to see a throwing attack, but Gangde, Oral, Ogre, and even Barbarian, even Richard himself, for a while They are all in the same place and can hardly believe everything that the eye sees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard first recovered from the shock and immediately shouted: "The barbarian! Array attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian warrior made a uniform war, mentioning The square shield, lined up in a dense array, strode over the remaining cavalry on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen of the remaining red Cossack cavalry who are extremely brave. In the face of such a fierce battle, morale is still diminished, still screaming and rushing to the barbarian array, but In front of them is a steel-like barrier. The front row of barbarians took a step forward and pressed the shield. Behind them, the second row of barbarians used shields against the back of their front comrades. At this time, all the barbarians shined with faint light and got the blessing of the Elf Warsong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce and tough collision ended with the victory of the barbarian, and the cavalry that ran into the shield wall flew out, together with the sturdy horses, then the barbarian Side shield, swinging axe, a row of axe down, is a row of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that the barbarian warrior in his arm had defeated the impacted cavalry from the front, and Richard was very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, an extremely strong sense of danger suddenly hits Richard’s heart! He didn't have time to distinguish the dangerous direction, and he saw a faint gray light shining on himself. At the moment of gray light, a cold and cold death pierced the soul of Richard! When Richard was shocked, several nodes of the soul connection also shook, and then launched a counterattack at the same time, and smashed the death of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale golden fire instantly ignited on Richard, dispelling the subsequent death caused by gray light. This is the sacred death guard of the sand. It can fight the magic of the dead, even if the power is not enough, it can eliminate the effect of death, and the injured object is seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of flowing sand is incredible, almost gray light just shines on Richard, her fire is burning on Richard. Even so, Richard's face turned pale and snorted, dropping two black blood from his nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the seven-level magical death is not so easy to offset, even if the effect of death is removed, and the soul link resists some damage, Richard still It is not light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s once again with Death! And this time is the soul red / bare / bare face to face death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely complex emotion rushes from the bottom of Richard’s heart. It is an emotion mixed with fear and fury, so that he can fly with his short hair! Richard immediately locked the big magician in a truck compartment, and even saw the embers burning after the scrolls slipped from his hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower sand!" Richard screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is silent, and immediately gives Richard a magical spell: magic defense. The tacit understanding between her and Richard does not need to be expressed in a specific language. After putting the gods back, the sand drifted back and opened a distance with Richard. This time she did not try to give Richard a miraculous magic: boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Richard has firmly locked the opposite magician, burning in the depths of the raging fire, like a volcanic eruption! He clenched his teeth and squeezed incredible magic spells from his teeth, supplemented by quick but precise gestures, so that a fireball was constantly generated from his hands, and the launch interval was less than a second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
