This is a blow that can crush the rock, but it suddenly froze halfway down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lifted his right leg and kicked it in the belly of the bear, and the entire calf has barely penetrated into the muscles of the bear, there is no People see the movements of Richard. When they find that the situation has changed, everything has already happened. So deadlocked for a moment, the body of the bear has begun to tremble slightly, and Richard took back his right leg and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body figure of the wild bear was taken away all the strength, and Richard’s legs were closed, he was soft on his knees and thumped. On the ground, his hands fell heavily on the ground, and this barely supported the fact that he did not kneel on the ground. His fallen position happened to be in front of Richard. Richard reached out and grabbed his hair and raised his face. Raised up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, Richard’s wave is two loud slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you deserve, go back to your tribe and go to the women's camp," Richard whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Holy Scriptures, in a sense, is the qualification for drilling the mountain and the sea camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of a pretty bear changed from blue to white, and turned from white to red. Under the anger, a blood spurted out, and it was defeated in public. Two slaps, in the eyes of the most glorious barbarian warrior, is a shame that can't be erased in life. What he originally wanted was to let Richard Eternal life lift his head in front of everyone, but he did not expect it to become his own. ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already flashed a step to the side, letting the blood of the wild bear, the referee’s holy temple warrior looked at Richard’s gaze Surprisingly, even he didn't see how Richard kicked the kick. He didn't even understand that he only kicked a kick. How did the bear bear have no ability to resist? He immediately dragged the bear off the court. Road: "Five and ninety-six, Zhasa played."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhasa is a two-meter warrior, which is thin and weak in barbarians who emphasize strength and body shape. However, the muscles and bones looked as hard as steel. When he got on the court, he rubbed a black iron glove on his hands and stared at Richard like a wolf. He said, "I don't like you very much, so I will knock you down. Then take your slap in the face, as you did for the wild bear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he had not heard anything, he looked at the line and looked at the sky, still thinking about his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zisa screamed like a cheetah, and then the action was stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard took back the right leg of Zhasa’s lower abdomen, watched him stumble, then reached out and lifted his head, and it was two slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the sacrificial samurai changed from a strange to a stunned look, and looked deeply at Richard and turned to call the 46th, 46th. Geulum, a warrior in his early forties, is quite wild and has a heavy axe with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geurum raised the giant axe in his hand and said: "Put your knife, I don't want to take advantage of you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally regained his gaze and glanced at the opponent and said faintly: "No need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guru In the eyes of the smoldering anger, waving a giant axe rushed over, but the giant axe just about to kneel down, like the first two people in the air, stagnate for a moment, then lost control, hands off the ground, axe The blade fell deeply into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping out, Richard has already retired and will naturally not be hurt by a giant axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Grurum respected Richard, Richard also respected him, did not do anything, just watched him quietly The field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the test was finally over, and Richard played five games, each time a trick to resolve the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the platform ignited a raging bonfire, the winners were naturally elated, and most of the losers did not care, in wine, bonfire and girls Under the influence, the atmosphere soon reached the **, the night wind brought some strange sounds, and the winners could not wait to get into the camp of the Chinese and Italian girls. Of course, they would not suppress their own impact and screams. It is fierce and lasting, and the more it shows strength and maleity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was alone at the campfire, drinking and eating meat, and he was quite empty around, no barbarian warriors dare to stay next to him, naturally no longer There are no brain guys coming to provoke, five battles in the afternoon, Richard has long used action to tell the warriors of these tribes not to humiliate him, it will only be self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesang sat on the side of Richard and handed over a new wine bag and said, "It turns out that you are Richard. I didn't expect you to be so powerful. No wonder I can't see me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally looked up at her and said faintly: "You are not afraid of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should I be afraid of you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, no one dares to sit next to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because They think that you and they are not the same kind of people, in addition, I do not want to beat you." Gesang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up and looked at the barbarian warriors in the carnival and suddenly said, "Is this the so-called warrior? I only saw the muscles, but no Seeing the mind, because of the weakness, it is necessary to suffer insults, bullied by the strong, this is what the barbarians call brave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesang looked at Richard , said: "You are not a barbarian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes or not is not important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gesang looked at Richard and said very straightforwardly: "But I just want to invite you to my camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took a heavy breath "Sorry, I don't want to go, I hate drilling camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Gesang gave Richard an unexpected answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Richard and said, "Want to hear my story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said faintly: "You can say, I don't necessarily listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesang, regardless of Richard’s indifference, said It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a few years ago, she was still living in a tribe very close to the sea, and then met a young man, one from Noland The brave from the mainland, the young girl and his heart collided after the encounter. It was a young and proud warrior who made a special trip to Calando to hunt a beast. When he met the girl, he was on his way home. The young brave and the young girl agreed to come back to see her and hurried away, but at the next hunting festival, a soldier who won the tribe in the entire region returned, and according to tradition, brought back the soldiers of the violent leader. It was the hero of the tribe, and then on the night of the carnival, he got into the camp of Gesang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Gesang was still very young, unable to resist, and there was a painful and long night. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later, when the young Norland Warrior returned to Carando, he saw Gesang with his baby, so he left. No more looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, Gesang knew that his fears had become a reality, and that some of the custom that was used in the tribe was not accepted at Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very good story, you want to use me to replace him." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesang shook his head and said: "I haven’t been with him, even if it’s one night, it’s always my regret, but you are not him, I don’t want to use it. You will replace him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and said, "The story is over, I should rest."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, Richard." Gesang called him and said, "You can't enter my camp, but there are other winning fighters today. Can you let other people not enter?" My camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Gesang and said, "That place, you should not come at all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesang said: "If I don't come, I won't be stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not speak, turned When he returned to his own camp, when Gesang’s eyes flashed out of the way, Richard went out of the camp. This time he took the knife. He went to Gesang’s camp, pulled out the elf knife and inserted it into the camp. On the floor at the door, then said "It" is no longer ignore Gesang, went back to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf long knife flashed a faint cold light in the night, and Gesang suddenly felt very calm in her heart. She got into the camp and fell asleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper, the noisy people are feeling tired, and many of the winning warriors have extraordinary energy, but after several consecutive battles, Feeling tired, several soldiers with a full-bodied wine, went to Gesang's camp, one of them said: "I heard that Gesang is a beauty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another soldier smiled and said: "It is beautiful, but it is thorny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
