			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch turned into an unexpectedly successful deal, but 50,000 gold coins were in Richard did not stay in his hands for a long time, but only a day's effort returned to the hands of the various forces in the blue water oasis. As a big customer who spent 50,000 gold coins in one day, Richard gained universal respect and envy. Of course, except for the red Cossack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Water Oasis is a place where information can’t be hidden. Richard’s idea of ​​hostility to the Red Cossacks quickly spread to their local heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was extremely fierce, and solved Stricker through serial battles overnight, shocking many people. Then, after two days, a magical product transaction linked him to the only sanctuary of the blue water oasis, Luofu, and the Jinhui battle flag, which is not inferior to the red Cossack. It also made the red Cossacks scrupled. Obviously tough start. But the red Cossack's scruples are also limited to the blue water oasis city. As long as Richard leaves the city, it is hard to say what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000 of the 50,000 gold coins have been replaced with various types of magic materials, so that the number of structures that Richard can make has risen from two to seven. However, if you use all of them to make the shrinking version, you can do twenty. The rest of the gold coins became one hundred slaves of the sand people and fifteen snowy tribe barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sand people are all adult men. They are not tall, have dark skin, and are used to having thick beards. They generally have about five levels of combat power, this combat power is not outstanding, but as Tiffman said, endurance and riding are the characteristics of the sand people, just give them a horse, a machete, that is A very dangerous enemy in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand people are fierce and aggressive, very dangerous, and the case of the violent killing of the master by the slaves of the sand people often occurs. Therefore, in the human kingdom, most of the sand people are used for hard work in the mines, or they are rushed to the front line on the battlefield to become cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen snowman tribes of the Savannah tribe swear by their ancestors and loyal to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many ways to control slaves are many, the Xuefeng tribe barbarians are a way, and for the sand people, Richard has changed a technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smashed all the slaves of the sands into ten teams, and each team selected a strong man as the captain. If someone in the team escapes or tries to resist, the captain will be killed along with the rebel, and the team will randomly pick two people together as a victim. On the other hand, Richard also promised that in the future battles, as long as the number of kills exceeds ten, they will immediately be free and receive ten gold coins. If you are still willing to stay in Richard's team, then each time you kill an enemy, you will get two gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When armed with snow peak barbarians, Richard had to be much more careful, and equipped them with weapons and armor, and the corresponding gold coins were much more. Richard’s commitment to the barbarian warrior is to kill twenty enemies and get freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this approach is still unclear, but Richard can test it in future battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying in the Blue Water Oasis for a few days, after completing the necessary materials and equipment, Richard took everyone away from the blue water oasis and dyed Go deep in the land of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now his strength has expanded to a certain extent, and there are more friends in the bloody land. Richard got a piece of land in the edge of the city of Lanshui Oasis. The houses, military camps and prisons were well equipped and there were enough servants. The land is worth a lot of money and was jointly presented by Tiffman and Luofu. This site is both a wealth and a symbol, marking that in the blue water oasis city, Richard has already had his own place. The reason for the donation of the land is partly because of the structure of Richard, and most of it is because of the half-god that exists only in his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
