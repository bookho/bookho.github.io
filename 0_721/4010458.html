			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw the familiar face and figure, only However, the third daughter of the Duke of Peron, today wearing a uniform of a noble aristocratic girl, in her identity, plain to the extent of rudeness, mixed in the group of girls is not conspicuous, if not her voice Jubilin did not even notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty is the object that Jubilin has been striving for, but the Peron family is even higher than the original Mensa, and Jubilee is neither the Mensa, It is also very different from Wendy's age, so the pursuit is not very smooth, and I have not seen it several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect Wendy to be in this group of nobles, so he hurriedly slowed down and said softly: "Miss Wendy, how come you Here, and there are not a few powerful guards around, how to deal with the danger, these guys can not match your identity, so, I will send you back to the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic teenagers were so scornful and screamed, but they never dreamed that they would go out with the three ladies of the Peron family. Wendy was the vassal of the Peron family. The friend brought by the sister flower has not spoken before, and the high vertical collar of the riding cloak has covered most of her face, so that she has not been recognized by her peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic teenagers feel that the blood is starting to boil, this opportunity can be let go, I heard that Wendy is so favored that she has the right to choose her own partner. Once the young lady of this status is fancy, it is not only their own, but the whole family will fly together. In the face of such temptation, Jubilee does not seem to be so daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jubi Long heard their voices getting more and more ugly, their hearts were furious, their eyes swept away, and they shouted: "Take me all, don't push me to do it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenagers suddenly trembled, and suddenly dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded: "What's going on here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a team of patrol knights, a total of thirty rides, but they are faster than the royal knights who insist on the small steps, headed by a young man, wearing a mage robe, the style is as simple as the basic magic There was no one attached to the array, and it was he who asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jubilee turned his head and saw that the patrol knight’s armor had his most hated Archimonde emblem. It was only when this time happened that the Archimonde family was responsible for patrolling, and it was unfortunate that it was unlucky. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Archimonde since Richard became the patriarch, changed the simple and sour style of the Gordon period, and always looked at the giants. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, since the Royal Knight’s checkpoint moved from the arch to the foot of the mountain, the patrol mission of the floating island giants has become a symbolic event, and more is a wealthy show of aristocratic style. The place, Archimonde actually sent a full thirty riding elite knights, plus a magician to suppress, these knights do not have to pay, even if the magician looked at the sixteen, seven, is not cheap It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the heart is disgusted, Jubilee’s face will not naturally have a good face, and said coldly: “This is the Men’s family, how, you Akmon De also wants to insert a hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician smiled and said: "What is a hand, this is my duty, who are you, dissatisfied? I can go to the House of Lords to sue me later, but I must listen to me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Jubilee. Mensa, have you not heard of my name? "Zhu Binglong raised his head proudly. He still stopped in the sky and did not land. From this point of view, it can be said that he spoke to Richard with his nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the young magician actually shook his head and said, "Jubillon, I have never heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In the face of Wendy, this slap in the face is extremely loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jubillon’s face instantly turned into deep purple, and squeezed out a few words from the teeth: “Boy, are you insulting me, this is to be life For the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician did not put the threat of Jubilee in his heart, but smiled lightly: "If this is an invitation to a duel, then I can accept, ah, yes, forgot to introduce myself, my name is Richard Archimonde, you must know my name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jubilon I have been so angry that I have to be mad. After listening to it, I don’t even want to sneer. "Richard, where is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish a word, and the female sanctuary that had been watching alongside was exclaimed: "Richard, you are Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jubilin suddenly saved the name of Richard, and he couldn’t tell the ugly face. At the same time, his heart passed the warning. Archimonde’s acting patriarch would condescend to lead the team to patrol. What is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he glanced at the Knights of Richard and Archimonde, and settled a bit, and the patrol knights were ranked 14th and 5th. Even if there are thirty, what is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to Jubilee, but to the aristocratic teenager who could not stand up and could only sit still, and asked: "Who is playing?" Injury him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few aristocratic teenagers who were still indignant immediately pointed to the elite knight of Mensa, and said in unison: "It is him." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Oh, well, let's dismount, let go of the weapon, and take a trip with us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say," The knight was almost awkward, clenching the sword in his hand, glaring at Richard, and Richard did not ask what happened, but he would He walked, and it was a way of disarming to treat prisoners. This kind of disposal, to say that the Cavaliers would take it, would be a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "You are a civilian, but you have injured the nobility here. No matter what the reason, you are first guilty. This is doubtful." Besides, you talk to me in this tone, add sin to your sin, unload your armor, climb over, don't let my people do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The Knights of Mensa almost do not believe in their ears, and their eyes are full of anger. Although most of them are indeed civilians, they are the family knights of the giants, or belong to the plane army. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog in the giants is also nobler than the small aristocracy. This is an unwritten rule in the upper class. The charges announced by Richard are indeed established, but at most It is just a symbolic reprimand. It is more than compensation for medical expenses. It will only be paid in the name of an individual. No one will seriously deal with this level of conflict, unless you want to offend the Mensa family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jubilong suddenly realized that Richard was specifically to offend the Mensa family this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was gradually gloomy and he was about to say something, but he saw that Richard had reached out and pointed to the unrestrained Mensa Knight, so a knight suddenly rushed out behind Richard, and the speed was so fast. Unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde Knight had already rushed to the Mensa Knight in an instant, and when he reached out, he brought the other person out of the battle and then ran back to Richard. In front of this, in this short distance, I have already tore up the refined lock of the Mensa Knight, twisting his sword and throwing him in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s movements are as windy as ever, from the beginning to the end, the Menza family’s knights have failed to respond, and the elite door that bears the brunt The Cavalier suddenly became like a weak chicken, and he didn't even struggle with the struggle. Not to mention the resistance. After being thrown on the ground, he was obviously in a state of half-half and half-awake, and he did not even have the strength to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol knight finished all this and returned to the team on his own, and merged with other patrol knights, no longer each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the patrol knight rushed out, Mensa’s female sanctuary seemed to have a blockade, but the hand just stopped but she stopped staring at the name. After watching the whole process, the patrol knight suddenly whispered: "Construct the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only like this when she noticed her, she looked at her up and down. Lazy and said: "It turned out to be Ms. Yulia. No wonder, this eyesight is still quite good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulya’s face is blue, not Knowing how to respond, if she is also known as a strongman in the field of extinction, it is not a sanctuary with empty name, and thus becomes the backbone of the Mensa family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at ordinary times, she may have already started to work hard, but Richard is a special person, so she has to be scrupulous. And since Yulia recognizes that Archimonde is trying to catch people, it is the construction of the knight, and the heart immediately sounds a bell, because even now, she looks at the past, the 30 Akmen Knights are still ordinary and elite. Such obvious hidden power, obviously has an ulterior motive, perhaps just wants her to hold hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard apparently did not intend to end this, but instead pointed out that dozens of Mensa Knights who had unconsciously pulled out their weapons were still faint : "You dare to show me weapons, that is sin, all are dismissed, let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
