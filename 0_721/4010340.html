All the knights on the top of the hill are in the eyes of the fire, and the squad feels the wrath of the master, and also squats with the iron hoof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya looked up and saw the look of Richard’s smile and laughter. Suddenly, he felt a red fog rising in front of him, and grasping the sword’s hilt To pull out the sword, take out the long-standing "Knights, move forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Suya’s sword has been squirted half All the knights’ eyes were on his sword!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a harder and stronger hand held Suya’s hand, It was the general sent by the Marquis of Sauron. He stared at Suya’s eyes and said slowly and resolutely: "The order of the Marquis must not be in conflict with Richard. Since he does not attack, then we should retreat." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya's face swelled red, and pulled a few times to force the sword, but the half-sword of the sword not only did not move, but was slowly pressed back to the scabbard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Baron, if you insist on violating the Marquis' orders, then I will dismiss your command." The general said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Suya indignantly pushed the sword back to the bottom of the sheath and continued to stare at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard has ignored him, is looking at the generals around Suya with an interested look, but his heart is a bit sloppy, Richard is the most annoying It is this kind of calm opponent. They may not have the genius of soldiers who are unpredictable, but they have extremely rich experience and meticulous ideas. They rarely make mistakes. Richard often needs superior strength and the ultimate in the mother-in-law. The battlefield micro-command to defeat the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite knights have all walked in front of the hills, and then the knights are built. On the mountain downhill, the knights of both sides are looking at each other. Hit, it seems to shoot a spark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation is very obvious, the Marquis of the Marquis of Soren may not be lost to the opponent, but the equipment on his body, the mount on his knees, and even the body The structure is far less inferior. Nearly half of the seventy-five riders are first-class knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the five hundred people of Licha, like an outing, swayed in front of Suya, who had a strict military uniform, and then went away. In the whole process, there was no protective flank, and even the defender did not stay. Richard himself pulled At the end of the team, even his followers went to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as the squadron is loaded with a charge..." Suya’s head flashed the idea involuntarily, and was very tempted, one of the battlefields was separated from the army. The magician is a good target, but the generals around him stare at him tightly, making him unable to make over-rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two armies were completely divided, Richard’s heart was as sorry as Suya, and Archimonde was still a famous player. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Suya, Richard officially stepped into the territory of the Black Rose Castle and looked at the beautiful scenery of the Yuanwang Peninsula. Richard suddenly remembered the first time. Embarking on this land, at that time was next to him, Modred, a man nicknamed "The Devil", a terrible existence in the eyes of an outsider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Black Rose Castle is less than 100 kilometers away, but between him and the castle, there is still a last obstacle, Goliath . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gore's military camp is set up on a flat grass, except for a small forest, there is no terrain available, it is also the most suitable for cavalry. Terrain, and many of the arrays in Goliath are infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barracks are small in size, and the temporary fences are more like dividing lines than defenses. Soldiers in the barracks look relaxed and there are There are laughs, but the military affairs are all in good order and there is no clutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real veteran. Even if the battle is imminent, it will be just as easy. It will not affect the rest because of nervousness or other unwanted emotions. The physical strength is Guarantee of combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military camp is not big, there are tents of similar style everywhere, the Chinese army big account is just a little bigger than other tents, there is no special place on the material and decoration. The size is also because Goliath's figure is much taller than ordinary humans, as well as marching sandboxes and maps are placed in his camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s clothing, food, shelter, and transportation have always been the same as ordinary warriors. In the Earl’s army, senior officers and costume knights are also the same. The preferential treatment is that the food rations of the strong and the knights are much higher. Their body consumption is much greater than that of normal people, and therefore special food is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already afternoon, the soldiers have just used lunch, and the camp is still filled with a strong aroma of food. Goliath is walking freely in the military camp, always chatting with the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a detective rider rushed to the army and rushed to the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers immediately ran to the front of Goliath at the fastest speed, and said with anger: "Adult, Richard has entered the periphery of Yashan, distance We are only a dozen kilometers away, he is moving very fast, we may only have half an hour of preparation time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Half an hour, that is enough." The voice of Goliath is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already quiet, and no amount of light fell on Goliath. Waiting for his final decision, the knights of the building returned to their respective camps. They need more time to prepare their weapons armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gomalia did not immediately make an order, but stood there quietly, not knowing what to think, letting the precious preparation time one by one The passing of the drops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Earl, it’s time to make a decision." Someone can't help but remind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goliya turned a deaf ear, and after another five minutes, he was like a returning man, and told him: "Let the soldiers go out of the line, build The Cavaliers also dispatched. In addition, the servants left the servants to burn more meals. Richard went all the way. At this time, he should have not had lunch yet, and he should be prepared for him five hundred... No, a meal for a thousand people."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left and right are all in vain, although this order is unspeakable, but seeing that Goliath’s apparent determination has been fixed, the subordinates will immediately disperse to execute the military order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there was a small military camp in Goliath in the sight of Richard, he first stunned, but the results of the second review verified the first The judgment of the eye is that the soldiers in this military camp should be only about 2,000 people, and the limit cannot exceed 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looked at the Galia army array on the open floor and judged that it was indeed two thousand people at a glance, not far from there. The grove, there is also the ability to bury the ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the woods are not large, or a sparse forest, that is, the ambush can not lie much, not to mention Richard's troops are all elite and full cavalry, the combat power is extremely powerful, the maneuverability is superb, to deal with such small-scale super elite The best way for the troops is to gather all the troops to fight in front of each other and use the number to pile up the number of casualties. As for the ambush, the road is a joke. There are so many knights in the hands of Richard, what kind of volleyball line is It can be easily cut through, and the dispersal force is simply a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was riding forward and said hello to Goliath standing in front of the front line, saying: "The count, I did not expect to see it here." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can’t see you here," said Goliath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped from the sacred unicorn and looked at the mighty man who had seen him on the floating island. The mood was quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the timely appearance of Goliath and Ellie, Richard might have become a bunch of bones, but now, Goliath is standing in Richard Between the Black Rose Castle and the Black Rose Castle, it was prepared to block Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the army behind Goliath again, and the other party put out the most traditional battlefield, without any intention to hide the power, all The strong and the legal person are in the position where they should be. Richard saw three Sanctuary strongmen, one big magician and fifty construction knights. The remaining two thousand soldiers are elite, but they are ordinary warriors, regardless of equipment. Or the level is far from the elite knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very arrogant, but it’s very relevant to Richard at the moment. Richard really only brought 500 people, but there are exactly one hundred and five Ten rides are equipped with knights, and far from the majority of Goliath is a first-order construction knight can be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorelia sighed in secret, he remembered that when he was young, there were often words that people thought were arrogant, but then The facts prove that he can always honor his declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sniffed the smell of the food that came from the air and said, "You take care of the soldiers very well. It is the standard of this kind of food, the annual military expenses." It will increase a lot. In fact, I don’t understand very well. Why do people like you have to mix up with the so-called family councils who don’t know what they are? The patriarchs of our Archimonde are all playing out. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
