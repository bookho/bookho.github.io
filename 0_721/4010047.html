			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the last mob disappeared from view, Faschi looked back Look at the three people, Yan Mei, Winnington and Winika, and say, "Go to the Earl, and the adults will protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I Don't go, this is the castle of my father! Our graveyard in Archimonde is also here!" Yan Mei said firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi frowned and said: "They don't dare to tamper with the Archimonde family cemetery. Your insistence is meaningless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 shakes his head and says, "No, I want to stay here, where is the last death, here is still the father’s territory, but only by a group of thugs. Occupy it. But if I am afraid of leaving, it will be to give it to them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi glimpsed, did not expect this girl to return Can have such insights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the portal of the Eternal Dragon Hall, he did not think about what kind of situation he would face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal is located in the transfer area of ​​the Eternal Dragon Hall, which is the area where the average person is forbidden. When the sand and Richard came out of the portal, even the clergy who were stationed in the transfer area were shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Richard, a person who should have been lost in the turbulent time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand did not let Richard return to the floating island first, but took him to visit the Vatican’s great priest, on the one hand, the coordinates of the Faro plane Record in the Temple of Eternal Dragon and fight for the plane number. Once numbered, Noland and Faro have a wonderful connection with each other, which reduces the cost of transmission and increases the success rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that Richard wants to know the truth that was lost in the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline just told Richard that this was because his sacrifice results were disturbed. At least the dissident is who she did not say, but suggested that Richard should pay more attention to what happened recently in the floating world before leaving the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin’s words made Richard feel a bit incomprehensible and faint. So he pressed an anxious heart and listened to a beautiful god official who told about the recent events of Faust. Listening and listening, Richard’s face changed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon lost in the Qiqi plane? And also brought almost all the main forces? So, the Archimonde territory, including the floating island, is not extremely emptiness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...Goddon can still come back, if so, when is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is plagued by Richard’s heart. It is getting clearer and hotter, and even has a burning feeling. The sting of the silk looks unremarkable. But in a blink of an eye, he was a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon, that seems to be omnipotent, the man who is screaming all day long, rough and unrestrained, how can he be trapped to the point of life and death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood up and forced himself to sit down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Richard's ugly face, Liu sand was very worried and asked: "Lee! Don't worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I have no feelings with Gordon." With a blank expression, the voice could hardly hear the same thing, and then added: "I just don't want things that should belong to me to be taken away by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sand does not believe at all, but nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought again and said, "I need some help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liu Sha carefully listened to Richard's request and thoughts and thought about it. He said: "It should be no problem. But the Eternal Dragon Temple follows the belief of the Eternal and Time Dragon. If you want help, you must pay for it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am ready," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands nodded and walked out of the side hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the drifting sand left, Richard suddenly said to the young goddess who stayed, "Can you give me a basin of ice water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and beautiful goddess officer looked at Richard with some doubts and turned away. After a while, she came in with a copper basin filled with a basin of clear water and a piece of ice on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha picked up the basin and went to the window of the side hall, which overlooks most of the floating world. His face was calm, but when he saw a floating island slowly moving in the air, his eyes twitched slightly. So Richard lifted the high water basin and poured a basin of water with ice residue on his head! The ice water flows down the forehead and cheeks, fills the collar, and then sticks to the skin until it flows out from the feet. The water took away a lot of body temperature, and the convulsions in the corner of the eye gradually subsided. In this way, Richard forced himself to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the goddess officer glared at his little mouth and stared at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly walked up to her and gently lowered the copper basin without making a sound. Then he came back to himself and turned it back to Noland's box. The wooden box with the magic effect is divided into five layers, each of which can be opened like a drawer. In the box of the top two layers, a piece of rectangular metal is placed neatly. They are silver-gray, but at different angles, you will see a gleaming neon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanted cloud iron ingot, which is the product of highly purified cloud iron after magic treatment. After the magical dyeing, the characteristics of the light, flexible and magical affinity of the cloud iron are preserved, and the original strength is greatly improved, which is no less than the forging of black iron. This is the material of legendary magical equipment, worth tens of times the same amount of gold. Yuntie is a material that is rich in Faro and lacks in Noland. Of course, Faro’s so-called rich production is also relatively limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanted cloud iron ingots that Richard brought back in Norland are worth more than one million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted back to the side hall, followed by two priests and a tall and mighty shrine knight. The knight’s body was covered with faint pressure. Just entering the side hall made Richard feel uncontrollable trepidation, so Richard immediately understood that the knight was close to legend. His strength is too strong, and it is inevitable that it will overflow from the body, and has nothing to do with its own control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand came to the face of Richard and introduced the people who brought it: "These two are the goddess of hope and Nolan, they will answer your questions about The issue of the sacrifice and the plane of the plane. This is Ferdinand, the second longest of the Knights of the Dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
