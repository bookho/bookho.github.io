If it is the end of the game and the Dangmao Doma duel, it is quite good to be able to tie a tie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Giant Eagle Say: "Good, then he is a little better, anyway, you are always right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old giant eagle sighed helplessly and said: It seems that I really should let you go out and experience it, lest you always feel that you are very powerful. When you are defeated by someone who is not a big magician, you will know that this world is like a strong man. When is it? I can't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant eagle hovered over the head of Richard for a week, and Li under the eyes squinted, his eyes locked in him. But they are far away in the last kilometers altitude, no matter who or what is really Eagle changing patterns in the air is always overwhelmingly dominated, so Li Chasuo of laissez-faire and move on to the snow-capped mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s an arrogant guy, teacher, let’s go.” The young giant eagle seems to dislike Richard very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old giant eagle said, "No, wait a minute, I think, I need to give him some help so that he can go further in the Holy Scriptures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he slammed his wings, a black feather fell off the body, falling like an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After shaking off the feathers, the two giant eagle flew northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go find someone called Goshawk, look See if he can still fly like the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Godhawk, isn't that the empire of the Millennium Empire, he is still alive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not only the prince of the Millennium Empire, but also the father of the mountains and the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remembered, he was not caught by the barbarians for almost 20 years. Well, when he has been a prisoner for so many years, what else can he use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not necessarily true, some men are crouching for decades, once they have a chance, I can still fly to the sky. The mountain and the sea are his daughters. I believe that he will not sit idly by. Maybe he needs an opportunity that is likely to succeed. With our help, everything will have a chance. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, you are talking about politics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes If this kind of thing is to be solved, it needs politics. At least there must be factors that can balance the influence of the sacred dynasty, and then a certain thing will be changed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But since the key factor is politics, why should you give that precious thing to the kid? He actually People would dare to go participate in the canon, which is tantamount to challenge the whole Karan, ah, is simply stupid. "The young eagle began to chatter Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Politics, like porcelain, looks beautiful and rigorous, no matter how hard we try, we can't find a gap that can be used on it. But a stupid and sloppy child, with a hammer coming over, could be crushed. Richard, the one who took the hammer, is the key in this game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you are always right, he is holding a hammer because it is stupid enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Giant Eagle Hehe smiled and said: "That's not necessarily, maybe it's because he is too smart, so he will choose this seemingly stupid way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you grow up, you will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am an adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult is not the age of the age, but the mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant eagle talked to each other, all the way away, and Richard stopped. On the ground a few meters in front of him, a feather fell from the sky and was deeply inserted into the rock, revealing only a handle. He looked up at the sky, and the two suspicious giant eagle had disappeared, but the feathers were obviously they left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught the feathers and used it several times to pull it out of the rock. The feathers were dark and heavy, and the lines were clear and delicate. It is like a real feather, but these lines are part of a magical array. This magical array is so delicate and ingenious that even Richard can't see through all its mysteries for a while, but Richard has been playing for a while and already knows its function. This feather is a one-time magical prop that can block a powerful attack. According to Richard's estimation, any one of the following characters can be completely defended, and the general legendary strongman's dedication The strike will also be offset by more than half the power and become affordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a magical item is undoubtedly extremely precious. Any leader of a wealthy family wants to have such a thing in his pocket. Even more so than life, the only difficulty in life is the craftsmanship. The difficulty of the magic feather lies in the rare materials. Even the materials that Richard can’t recognize must be rare, so this kind of thing It is extremely rare, and it may be able to come out several times a year, even if it is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the root of this feather, Richard saw a small little symbol. In the field of the Master, this little symbol is almost universally known, it is Solomon. The mark of the Fort Scholar Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, the symbol of the Solomonsburg scholar wizard may be more important than the magic feather itself, does this mean that in this matter, Solomon The Fort Scholars have already stood on their own side. Otherwise, they do not need to keep this symbol. The Solomon Scholars are far-reaching. They may not be as good as the sacred dynasty in the secular power, but the potential influence will not be much worse. The Masters of this school have always flaunted their neutral stance to explore the secrets of the world as a lifelong pursuit, but if they think that they have no contention with the world, then it is a big mistake, and behind many conspiracy incidents on the mainland, See the figures of scholars and mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the world of construction, the scholar mages who control the secrets of the magic set are no worse than the royal family of the Holy Tree Dynasty, although the Magic Set may not be as good as the Heavenly Armed Forces. Powerful, but there are only seven sets of Heavenly Armed Forces, and the Magic Set is still in production. Even if the production of the Magic Set is extremely difficult, it will take about ten years to complete, and its number is still slow and firmly increasing. In this regard, the armed forces of the country that cannot be produced again are far from being comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard puts the magic feather in his pocket. For him, it doesn't matter if the Solomon Castle scholars support himself. If you can't win in the holy book, then no more support is meaningful, so the ability of the magic feather itself. It is much more important than that symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolute battlefield, in the rising sun, Philip is using breakfast, the emperor’s breakfast is always so rich, and the meal is worth a meal. A few months after the ordinary people, and since entering the Rising Sun, his food has increased by 30% than before. It is just a food, which is a heavy expense for the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of dusk, a few years after the war of the year, the military fortress has undergone a preliminary reconstruction, with some human appearance, but everywhere There are also traces of Dakosodas. Humans don’t have the kind of races that can be built like workers. The ordinary human artisans can’t stand the harsh environment of the battlefield, so after a few years, Philip’s place also It is a big stone house with more than a dozen rooms, and more than half of the work is done by the emperor and his guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two heavenly sanctuaries who accompanied Philip in the same year, died in the years after the war, and the people who can be trusted by Philip Two less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the stone house in the palace is dark and dark, and the lighting is based on a magical torch that can burn for months instead of soft and bright, and the decoration is the wall. On the big tapestry, there is no maid or guard in the restaurant. Some are just a middle-aged minister who is wearing a weird approximation to the clown. This close-knit is the person who has been following Philip, originally. He has already obtained his own fiefdom and title, and he should go to the business territory. However, after hearing a battle in the dusk, he ran back to Faust, and he followed the rising sun. In his words, it is in a difficult place that his Majesty needs to eat better, and no one knows more about the taste of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the courtier is not outstanding, and it is impossible to stay in the dusk for a long time. However, he found the armor of the court to build a helmet like armor, and the robe is not like Hua. The eccentric equipment of the robe, although it looks funny, can effectively resist the radiation of the origin of the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of dining at Philip, the near minister is reading two letters, both of which are from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe quietly listened, did not say anything, but finished all the food, then put down the knife and fork, thinking silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
