			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting hall of the masked lord of Deepwater City was destroyed during the war and later looted. Except for the valuable decorations, all the documents related to the meeting were lost. Maybe someone wants to find clues about the identity of the masked lord from these materials? Or simply want to destroy the past data? No one can be sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address of the new council was chosen in the original public bath, which is the most complete large building in Deepwater. Just fill in the bath and change the direction of the original bench to become a meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Members” elected by each region gathered here, with more than 60 people. They come from all walks of life, different ages, experiences and ways of looking at things. Some people are full of enthusiasm, some people are full of doubts, some people sneer at this situation, only a few people are really ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who presided over the meeting was a chubby bald man, with torches and beads illuminating his head, especially conspicuous. He read the manuscript in a loud voice, praising the good wishes of the residents of Deepwater City for a peaceful order and the courage to act on it. He cast aside the original masked lords and thought that those people were just "conspirators who dare not see the light." Such arguments caused both snoring and applause, but neither sound actually had any use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Dennis sit in the back corner, watching more than sixty heads and a shiny brain door. The smell of sweat in the surrounding air is mixed with the smell of soap that is always clean in the wall, which makes people suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The air circulation here is too bad, how long will your parliament be held?" Siegel asked Dennis: "And those who have magic effects "Is there any fun in the campaign?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me, even if everyone is not affected by the spell, the campaign has never been fun." Dennis replied: I have a mask that resists my mind control and can help people around me. This is the welfare I receive as a lord. Can't I give up the advantage in pursuit of absolute fairness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not necessary. If the minds of all the people in the city are not clear, it is a real disaster. But you must remember that although the power of the spell makes the people in the city obey and absolutely respect the authority. But this kind of If the situation continues, it will lead to death. Deepwater City must contact the Masters Association or the Morning Temple to invite the caster to treat the public, otherwise you can only guard a dead city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dennis nodded: You have reminded me many times, I remember. But now you are going to play. The fat man is finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue really sounded awkward Applause, then the host asked: "Who needs parliamentary services, please ask first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people stood up, including Siegel. But when the light on the defensive staff lit up, everyone else sat down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Siegel. Squid. Deepwater City pioneers the Knights, and Hem is the lord of the Baron. I left my castle from the south of the New World and went all the way to the North. Originally, I had to fight with the elves and eventually only played against the prairie. Fortunately, the deep water city is still in the hands of the people in Sham Shui Po. Since your new parliament claims to replace the masked lord meeting to rule the city, then I would like to ask, my baron. What about the title and pioneering knight title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has caused discussion. Most of the people present here are from civilians. They don’t know the rules and practices of the nobility. They think that the rule is just to deal with neighborhood disputes and tax collection. Under the influence of the spell, I encountered something that I didn’t understand. They will fear and obey the higher status, so it is hard for them to make some ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short-haired old man stood up and said to Siegel in a slow voice: "I remember that if the superior lord dies and does not have a heir, then he The non-permanent title will not be effective. And Deepwater City needs self-protection and has no ability to develop.” He coughed twice and seemed to use his tenacious vitality to squeeze out the sentence: “The new parliament naturally wants to The lords draw a clear line and usher in a new beginning, so we should not inherit the historical issues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If under normal circumstances, there will definitely be a lot The voice of opposition. The more the number of parliaments, the more chaotic it is. But the more comprehensive the voice can be. Under the influence of the Knox Commonwealth spell, who is more like authority, the more people obey. There were countless approvals at the meeting, just as the old man said the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I led two thousand cavalry across more than three thousand miles and rushed to Deepwater City, not to rescue a group of ungrateful people. According to the agreement between me and the sacred lord of Sham Shui Po, Sham Shui Po should be based on half of my land and me. The merits of the battle increase my title or pay me. I see that the new parliament wants to save money, but also save the title? I will never agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two thousand cavalry let everyone close their mouths, and magic makes Siegel an authority in authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care what method you use to manage Deepwater City. New leaders must guarantee my interests." Siegel said: "If it is because of new The reason for the parliament has led to legal problems in my pioneering territory, then my cavalry will help me get back to justice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just!" someone shouted. Soon I got the peace of mind. "We should have a speaker, but only the lord can manage the lord, so we should choose a speaker lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord? Right! Election lord! "Others shouted: "The Speaker of the House of Lords, the Speaker of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat down and he has completed himself in this meeting. The task - to promote the election of the speaker. Next, he only needs to make a statement at a crucial moment, and it is enough to make the balance of victory to Dennis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But watching the situation at the conference, most people are stunned by the magic, they all seem to be thinking, in fact, all the brains are strange. The reason is to convince yourself, that is, blind obedience. The miraculous system of the Speaker of the House of Lords was created in this state, and there may be no chance of reappearing on both continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes. Under the protection of the spell, not only can the noise be reduced, but also the hostile action of the malicious person can be prevented. Since Dennis can avoid the influence of Knox spells with masked lord masks, other masked lords can. These people will not blindly follow, they are likely to have hidden in and implement their own plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not excluded that they have reached an agreement first - after all, Siegel has only appeared for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this large steam bath, sailors, soldiers, blacksmiths, stables and butchers are guided by emotions, forming a flow of water to the left or right, quarreling with each other ,indecisive. When everyone started to lose caution because of fatigue, Dennis stood up. Begin to influence the ocean of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he created a whirlpool that focused everyone’s ideas on him. After the election, he wished to become the first lord of the deep water city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s old story is revisited. Asked Deepwater City to have a clear attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a good thing to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepwater City enters a new chapter of history and no longer has a ruling relationship with the knights and jazzs that were previously enshrined, but still recognizes the titles and territories they have acquired. Heim’s collar is entirely part of Siegel, and is no longer a “new land” acquired by the pioneering knight. That is to say, the rules that originally developed the Cavaliers and the Lord’s “half the meeting” were terminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new council will handle all legal documents. It is acknowledged that all the land that Heim receives belongs to Siegel. According to half of the total land area, Siegel needs to pay the last "tax" to become independent and become a free lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight Siegel also has the baron title of the Star Kingdom, swearing allegiance to Prince Aaron, not a complete free lord. But on the New World, he has no bondage and can manage the territory in full accordance with his own ideas - he has been doing this, but now he has been legally recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every mu of land is taxed according to the value of a gold coin, can you disagree with Siegel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to pay for goods instead of gold." Siegel said: "Unless you admit that I have minted my own coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goods are Better choices, especially for the deepwater city that just ended the siege war.” The new Speaker, Lord Dennis, said: “We want food, cloth, salt and iron. And we can't exceed the average price of Deepwater City. You can provide What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
