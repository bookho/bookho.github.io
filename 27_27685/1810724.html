After a smile, he said: "Adventurous, you still don't want to do this. You are going to earn money to live." We don't need to face such a situation. We are the masters of the association, they are very strong, and they are not bad people. Why do you have to commit crimes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke and used the power of charm, even Elsa, who had to protect his son, became embarrassed, not to mention the only six-year-old boy, Dodd Juyan. Elsa spoke up and said, "Mr. Good gentleman, let's go. You helped us before, this time you can't bother you any more. We can solve it ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Also," Siegel said. The wizard who showed the power of charm showed a proud look to his companions, and then waited for Siegel to leave. However, this level of charm power does not affect Siegel, and the caster does not even know that his spell has been resisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I do with this idle thing, there is absolutely no reason." Siegel removed the handle from the hilt and dropped it to the thigh. "I am very persuaded because my teacher told me to listen carefully to others, especially those who are pleasing to the eye, and can't temper them. So I ask you, for the questions I just raised with Yan Yue, you Think about the answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" The charm enchanter stunned, this is not the effect of his own spell, how can there be a spell? Can you still ask questions? He narrowed his eyes and looked at Siegel carefully. He suddenly said, "Be careful, he resisted the charm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the other two mages also Come to the stables and surround them. One of the wizards was awkward, and the clothes were cut open, but they were not injured. "How haven't solved it yet, bring the child. Leave this backcountry. Kill directly, don't delay time! What are you waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Waiting for me.‚Äù Siegel raised his left hand and had a golden ring on it. The top of the dragon claw shape was inlaid with a small irregularly shaped stone. "This is the latest product. It is called the elemental wave ring. Its role..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystallized stone makes a squeaking sound, and it burns out instantly and becomes A blue smoke in the air. Then a lot of elements are like waves, rushing around. In the range of more than 20 meters, everyone experienced a small elemental surge. Although it is not enough to cause any damage, it has a good effect on the magical enchantment of these wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crystal stone is the kind of rabbit in Warcraft's head, the ring is just the trigger carrier. Siegel himself is well versed in elemental power control, so this small surge did not affect him. The four mages only felt that the wind was blowing, and then it was sour, hemp, and hot. They looked down at their bodies, touched the mage's gown, and found that they were not hurt. Some people dare to provoke them, really looking for death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people did not think about the direction of lifting the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a ** teacher, Siegel naturally knows what the Master has the most headaches. He took the flying knife from the dark groove of the belt and threw the hand at the front door. Then take out a batch of squats to the back door. The mage of the front door believes in his magical barrier, but still conditioned to raise his hand to stop. This time, the block saved his life: the flying knife pierced his palm, and the blood flowed down his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! My hand!" He yelled, and several other wizards were shocked. They also tried to avoid, but two people were thrown by the flying knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, why my Master's armor and shields didn't work, where is the skew shield?" A wizard took out his wand, but It is a waste of time to check your own protection spells. "The triggering technique is gone, even the shield pin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A missed flying knife drew an arc in the air and then inserted his Back brain. Masters without protective spells are very vulnerable. Not to mention that Siegel also uses this spell that secretly manipulates the trajectory of the flying knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining mages have no habit of nonsense, raising their hands is a ray of death. For such a spell that relies on aiming, it is necessary to prejudge the action of the target. Siegel lifted his foot and used the pace of the elves to escape the rays through the abrupt translation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
