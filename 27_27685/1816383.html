			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your trust, His Majesty the King." Siegel reached out, just like pulling a curtain, directly tearing open the space and establishing a pass. Go to the portal of the Temple of Magic. "It won't take up too much time - if everything goes well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Evan, all the members of the pre-meeting meeting stood up, "What do you do?" Arrived in the palace, no magic is allowed!" They looked at Siegel with a surprised expression, and there was a slight tension between the slightly trembling eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a magical god, it is not difficult to do all this." Siegel put his gaze on the intelligence chief wiki: "How the wiki didn't tell you His spies are all over the world. Unfortunately, the work of the assassin made by the spies has forgotten to transmit information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cat I sent, but no assassin The wiki shook his head: "The Marquis must have misunderstood something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This possibility does not exist, but you can't convince me." After Siegel finished, he would no longer pay attention to the wiki's explanation, but first entered the portal. Evan finished the whole clothes and put the sword in his hand and went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the pastor and the knight, the other people in the temple were persuaded to go out. Despite this, there is still a lingering smell in the Enlightenment Hall. Sweat, mud and human breath are mixed together, plus the incense that has just been ignited. Evan wrinkled his nose and sneaked a sneeze: "I was the first time I smelled the smell of such a market in the temple. I really didn't think. Is the magical temple particularly magical, mysterious and gorgeous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the art institute of the elves, not my magical temple." Siegel explained to Evan while guiding the way: "My magic comes from The need for life transformation, and the greatest achievement is to gain energy and improve the craft. Since magic can make a lot of people improve their lives, why should they be used as a minority poetry? The taste here is to remind us of magic. The real source: not the whimsy of some big men, but the basic needs of ordinary people. The need for survival, the needs of life, the endless demand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, it makes sense, and it sounds like that. If not all gods are hypocrites, I will also believe in magical gods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the magic god." Siegel Evan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, this joke is not fun. I know that you have studied the magical array of the palace, so it is not surprising that you can cast spells in the palace. But become a god? Unless you are a god, you have always disguised as a mortal with the identity of Siegel, otherwise I will not believe it." He indulged for a moment, then said: "Do you want the Stars to cooperate with the Temple of Magic? According to past experience and lessons - including the ancestral training of the kings - this is impossible, sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to cooperate, but not what you want That's the case." The gate of the temple is automatically opened in front of Siegel. Behind the door is a prayer room. There is nothing but a basic symbol written on the floor and on the wall in various languages. However, because I know that there will be many people coming, the statue of Reid, with the new priests and paladins of the temple, borrowed long tables and chairs, placed cups and flowers, and was barely a simple meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is sitting here with her daughter, facing away from Siegel, who is singing softly and sleeping with her children. Isaac himself moved the chair and was sitting in a serious position with a serious expression. When the door opened, he stood up and said hello respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestured to him and brought him to Evan: "Your Majesty, swear allegiance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Although it is a good boy, but the age is too small, not to take the oath?" Evan said strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the oldest man in my squid family. I have become a god, not a bad person." Siegel's son's black hair, "I am going to give him the title and Heim, and according to the rules, he is going to swear allegiance to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon squinted Siegel: "This is not the way you evade the vows? What do you want to do, use the spells to play in the outside world? Is there a world like a goblin?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am the only one who has not escaped, and you will understand it very quickly." Siegel patted his son's shoulder and said to him in a gentle tone: "Swearing allegiance to the sentence Have you remembered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan now knows that this is not a joke, so it is also serious, listen carefully to Isaac's vows, and then said: "Isac squid, I accept your vows, and you are the ancestors... the honor of the fathers In addition, you will continue to be the Marquis of the King of the Stars, the lord of Heim, the guardian of the New World and the arbitration. The original honor, trust and glory deepen this sacred... great 羁绊."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the devil's sword and clicked on Isaac's shoulders, then knocked on his head. It would not have been this knocking action, but Isaac did not move and showed good control. Evan put away the long sword, rubbed the child's hair, helped him stand up, and raised his eyebrows, jokingly said: "Your father has a feeling of wanting to leave home, it is definitely not good. You are now It’s the lord of Heim’s collar. Don’t let the soldiers grab him and shut him down in your mother’s room. Don’t let him go? You have to make an order to see if the knight’s loyalty is not?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not right to order my father, and the knights can’t catch him. It’s not wise.” Isaac replied very seriously: “The father is not I will lie to you, and you are deceiving me. Moreover, unless I do something contrary to justice and morality, the king cannot intervene in the things in my territory. This is not honor!"<br /><br />&nbsp Evanhaha laughed: "Well, you will be a better lord than your father. We are two at your age, one is a sailor, one is a swordsman apprentice, but you don't know More!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a territory, he will be better than me. Ms. Siegel saw Janet’s shoulders tremble slightly, knowing that she didn’t really want to see this scene, at least before Isaac’s adulthood, or before Siegel’s “Miyaz”, did not want to let herself What the husband did, after all, is too much like "interpreting things." She also understands that God will not die, and that her child will one day become a lord, but as a woman, she will still be tempted and she does not know what kind of mood she should use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked up to her, holding her hands on her shoulders and leaving a kiss in her hair. "Don't worry, I have more confidence in me. You don't know what a god can do, but you will understand it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is closed Eyes, cheeks licked Siegel's hand on her shoulder, did not say a word. In the end, he still only knows magic and does not understand women's minds. This has nothing to do with ability, no matter what identity, or even no reason. Emotion is unexplained. It is not based on logic and reasoning. It has its own trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Siegel does not handle complex politics, he also deals with complex emotions. Wendy and Mana are in the temple, which is a complicated matter in itself. Siegel thinks that it can be split up one yard at a time. This is not a spell or a magical array. Is there a clue that can be sorted out? Janet sighed a little and worried about it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the top of the long table and stood here. "This is not just the kingdom of Heim and the starry kingdom, but about all the races of the entire thunder wall world, even non-intelligent people. So..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He did not hesitate to raise his power, and his body was covered in the flame of iridescence. The priests of the Temple of Magic all fell to the ground, and they were moved by the power of the body, and they muttered in tears. Siegel spread the left palm, and the virtual image of a thunder wall world emerged. This is the same source as the third floor map of the Magic Academy Magic Tower, from where you can communicate anywhere in the world. The fire is still not stable, and Siegel is not willing to use such a strong force, but now there is no time to count so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves, dwarves, orcs, dragons; gnomes, half-humans, naga, and hidden souls, all races that use magic, here is The direct purpose of the magic god. Immediately through the portal to the Temple of Magic, there are important things to declare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s words are transmitted with the oscillation of the elements, All the creatures who can use magic have received this message. They were puzzled at first, but they were quickly convinced by this message that they came from the magic god. But where is the portal, who should go to the temple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question was quickly answered. Siegel once again increased his power and used the map in his hand to open the portal to the most powerful individuals of all races. For a time, the entire magical temple is full of flashes of space cracks. Every time a channel is opened, there will be a shadow of Siegel going in. The people present, only the magic statues of Reid and Evan, clearly see that the shadows of Siegel are actually clones, carrying the magical power of the gods, similar to the strength of the saints. Siegel sent his "special envoy" to the various strong places and asked them to come to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
