Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can visit himself at home in private time, which is already expected by Count Todd. Throughout the lords of the next generation of the Star Kingdom, Siegel is a very top-notch in every respect. He dares to fight, can fight, understand the importance of weaponry and knight training, and can also use the strategy on the battlefield. If you are looking for a military adviser who can help the Starry Royal Family to stabilize domestic rule, Earl Todd will make Siegel the first choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that Siegel has risen too fast, he is too young and needs to be polished in many ways. This is also very similar to Evan. A swordsman suddenly becomes a king. It is not a little bit that needs to be made up. So Count Todd has always had a face, treating himself as a sharpening stone that everyone hates, trying to make the novices grow quickly. He doesn't care if his own sharpening stone will be cut off by a brand new sword. He only hopes that after his death, he can calmly and proudly face the kings of the kings of the stars, saying that he has completed the service loyally and selflessly. The vows, so that you are not afraid of anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not afraid of death does not mean that you are going to die now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat across from him, put down the teacup in his hand, and cleared his throat and said: "Count, Todd, I want to experiment with you. I I want to recreate one, then kill you now, and then let you rise in your new body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, every word I have I understand, but I don't understand it when I connect." Count Todd snorted twice and shook his head. "I know that you always have some ghost ideas. This is definitely true. I don't agree."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this impression for you?" Siegel licked his face and put on the most sincere expression: "This thing is selfish and public." Yes, but overall, the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. Simply put, I am conducting a magic experiment, and if successful, it can reach the level of immortality. This experiment is somewhat risky, so I came to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you experiment with yourself?" Count Todd said: "Eternal life is the domain of God, only the most Mad people will try, and often have no good end "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". Did not end well give you an example, "Siegel sit and wait?.. This aspect of the spell test is his field, and Todd wants to defeat him here is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not many people have challenged eternal life and then left a bad end. Most of the negative examples are actually stories of folk bedside stories. Not many are worthy of scrutiny. For thousands of years, the temple has spared no effort to carry out propaganda. If you want to live forever, you must believe. If you pass the character, you will be able to go to the Kingdom of God as a voter. The reward you get is eternal life. In contrast, for example, the devil's devil's tree spell. Eternal life with the infinite lifespan of plants; or the wizard's lich changes and elemental changes are successful attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But changing to other forms, including becoming a God's electorate, can have a very big impact on one's original thinking. Different perspectives bring different perspectives on life, so these eternal life means giving up part of the past. “Being alone is the safest and least influential. This spell can bring a real millennium foundation to the kingdom.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd is obviously somewhat tempted, but Be very cautious about things that you don't understand. Siegel expected this, persuaded Todd to visit his lab and use his eyes to see the progress of the current test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a knight, but a true rigid knight with honor. He will definitely report what he saw to His Majesty, but he will never say any word to any one person, so he is the right person that Siegel believes can be kept secret. Siegel's "corpse" in the crystal coffin refreshed his concept. For a few moments, he seemed to be reconsidering whether he had handed over the burden of the king's affairs to the young man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are dead now, will you come out of the coffin again, just like nothing?" Count Todd gradually sorted out the matter. Then sighed: "But you are worried that the experiment failed, you have not resurrected, so I want to experiment with me. Although I am older. But I have not yet died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Another reason for finding you is piety." Siegel said: "I asked the wiki, he said that you are a very devout Believers, in all respects are the example of the Cavaliers. The identity of the consultant, plus the entire technology of the musket to the king. I finally said that the high-level priest can perform a resurrection. I gave this opportunity to you as insurance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel refers to the crystal coffin, the meaning of which is self-evident. "If they change their minds and don't resurrect me, can you beat the priests of the Temple of War? It's different from you. I have to go, so it's better to die once. How do you agree?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd was silent for a moment, licking his lips and falling into meditation. Siegel waited patiently, but he knew that the final result would not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sig, the squid of the squid," Count Todd rarely called the full name of Siegel. "If the test is successful, would you use this spell for the royal family of the kingdom of the stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is for sure." Siegel replied: "I Knowing that this will have a great impact on the future of the kingdom, and even change the various aspects of power transmission. These need to be studied slowly, even decades and hundreds of years to find a suitable solution. However, I believe Things will always go in the right direction. After all, there is better than nothing. Elves, dwarves and dragons have not lost their social organization because of their long life. Moreover, this method of continuation of life can only be used by very few people. It won't cause much impact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can decide who can live forever?" Earl Todd stared at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King and me." Siegel replied without hesitation: "In fact, this spell will eventually increase my power and, to a certain extent, Influence the power of the king. Are you worried?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I worry, I can’t wait to worry about the hidden danger now." Earl Todd shook his head. "But I also understand very well that I can't beat you now, and I can't stop you from doing anything. Without me, this experiment will continue. You can find some prisoners to do it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I thought about it too. Unfortunately, Heim’s collar was too peaceful in recent times, and there were no death sentences in my hands.” Siegel smiled: “There is still Another reason, if you can rejuvenate you, younger generations can mean that I can work for a few more years. After all, I am a mage, sitting in front of the table all day is not my ideal."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! You are honest, this is a rare quality among nobles or mages." Earl Todd stretched out and patted Siegel's shoulder: "Oh, I promise you. If you can get young, it will not be a bad thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides death, there may be other risks, I am here Listed a list." Siegel took a long scroll from the space bag. Surface densely written about more than a thousand. "It is almost possible to cause disability, dementia, slanting eyes or not to mention. In fact, except for not to mention, the Temple of War should be able to treat, and the fee I pay is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The count of Count Todd was soaked, too lazy to answer this sentence. He asked Siegel to cut a small piece of flesh and blood, and then watched it be soaked in utensils mixed with strange ingredients, starting to grow like sprouted potatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, let me go home before I feel sorry." The count made a cold war. "Your Master's method is still too weird. Later Every time I think about this scene, I will be scalp numb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When people are born, are they not full of filth?" Maybe not, Siegel miss you. "Before the test is successful, it is best not to say anything. If you can make sure that Evan is not talking about leaking, you can tell him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days Let me wait for some things to think more clearly and more comprehensively.” Todd shook his head and motioned Siegel to squat and send a magical spaceship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing will be known to Evan, but Siegel’s specific description of Siegel is not very concerned. When the spell succeeds, it will naturally be known to the world. After all, that is the original purpose of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To defeat Lear, you must first separate him from the Masters Association and become a personal grievance. Siegel can't fight the entire wizarding association, and it's hard to let the federation have the ability to counter the wizard association in the short term—and that is not what he wants to see. Want to "duel" with Lear, at least to achieve the same influence, the same prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille wants to use the management mages to deal with Siegel, but when no mage is willing to help him do this, his method will not break. . Cloning is a spell that is enough to cause this effect. In order to protect it, Siegel has set up layers of traps and protection inside the star, even if it is a sergeant, it is difficult to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
