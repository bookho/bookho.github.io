			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom’s starry flag floats on the mast of the Royal Fleet, but Aaron’s one-eyed sword flag is replaced by Evan’s golden sunflower. Www/xshuotxt/com At the suggestion of Siegel, the side of the golden sunflower depicts the shining sun, which makes the morning temple happy. The first major sacrifice of Aurora was presented to the new king, a gift: a pair of wristbands with a light pattern of the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wristband is created by the stars, and is suitable for the title of the kingdom of stars. It is difficult to destroy it in the mortal world, and the Lord of the morning is engraved with the Holy Power. Imprint, bring light at any time, dispel darkness and evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon lived in the room next to Aaron, the place where the guards were originally, then In turn accept the loyalty of the temple, the court, the guards, and the school. Master Lear also needs to be in front of the king, but he can't see anything from his expression, still calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, there is something I want to ask you." Avon said: "Aaron's body has improved under the personal care of the Lord of the Morning, but It is still very weak. The dwarf stone boat is not a good place to recuperate. I want to ask you to escort him to leave and return to the Star City. I don't know what you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The meeting of the Dwarf King is imminent, does the King's Majesty need my words?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accordance with the current dwarf sharing of information, I think this The meeting will not have any substantive results. So what the dwarves say is not very important. What matters is the attitude of the Masters Association and the City of Learning. This is one of the forces that will make me decide. The Association of Saying Teachers and the City of Learning are nominally two organizations, but no one can ignore their close internal connections. As a great prophet of the school, I hope that Master Lear can strengthen cooperation with the Masters Association. Keep the same interests as the Star Kingdom In order to seize the opportunity and overcome the difficulties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil bent down deeply, respectfully said: "There is such consideration in the majesty, it is the kingdom. The welfare of the family. I will follow your orders and arrange the return of His Royal Highness Aaron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the gold flagship and its two escort supply ships In addition, the other Royal Navy escort together. The wise Aaron can't go back alone, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it. The representatives of the school city left the stone boat in advance and escorted Aaron to the east. The Dwarf King said that he was puzzled, but he could only accept the explanation of the new king of humanity: "School City is the institution that serves the royal family. Everything is aimed at the long-term stability of the royal family. Therefore, the school will not express its opinions at the meeting. Unless It is the order issued by the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people including the court director Salk thought that the promoter behind this move was the Earl of Heim, Siegel But it completely slandered him. Although he has not been on the stone boat, Siegel has focused his attention on the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s closer to observation, and the guise-faced dice and its own icosahedron are completely a material. It only has more faces on it and a finer pattern. One hundred faces almost made this little thing a sphere, but if you scroll it on the table, he only has one number facing up at a time, and there will be no problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the twenty-faced scorpion is shining, but the scorpion has no movement. Whether it's magic, elements or other forms of energy, the scorpion scorpion ignores it. Siegel also tried to use this scorpion with a set of swordsmanship, which is still unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, useless, save your heart." Siegel muttered to himself. Put both dice in order: "But the following must be aimed at me. Even if he does not know that I have twenty scorpions, he is determined to win this one hundred-faced scorpion."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a very clear understanding of Lear's skills. If you haven't become a teacher yourself, and you have mastered the skills of four-pulse arrows, you will have no power to fight in the face of Lear's legendary spells. And this time, if you don't use the transmission matrix left by the Elf Saints, the power of the Urgian nuclear can be brought over. He has the technology and not enough power to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of advanced spells will be one of his biggest obstacles. If a mantra like a meteor burst can find the basis from a low-level spell and slowly derive it, then the time pause, the door to the outside world, and the big warning will seem to be built out of the air, and you can't build it by building blocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once deliberately hidden, even if Siegel wants to find a needle in a haystack, he does not have much time to consume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human magic is learned from elves, and elves learn from dragons. There is a William who has a good relationship with the dragon, and he can even set up a black king with the dragon. However, after hearing about this matter, William also shook his head firmly, saying that this is impossible. Siegel believes in him, but always try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden dragon is transformed into a human figure, comfortably lying in the largest cabin of the entire ship. Half of it is filled with food and the other half is used to store food debris. Every day, two supply vessels catch up with the stone boat, one of which is to deliver food to the dragon. When Siegel walked in, it was like stepping into the world's largest single restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you, young teacher. You are not coming to the dragon?" Jin Long said with a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I know that you have a good appetite, and you want to eat after you have enough activities. But fighting this kind of thing, you go to William." Better, I will not accompany you. I am here to have other things to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? I like being asked, especially the Master. Jin Long dropped the roast j in his hand and spit out the flame in the palm of his hands, burning off the residue and oil stains, and then sat up straight and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a high magic scroll or a magic book in the Dragon collection? I hope to borrow it. I am willing to pay the borrowing fee if it is reasonable and at my burden Within the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this?" Jin Long licked his lips and said with confusion: "You want to borrow books, this is too simple!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swayed and said to Siegel with a bright smile: "I can do this thing, Siegel, the result is not Maybe!” Jinlong seems to be very satisfied with his performance. He is very excited about his pats: “According to the agreement reached between the dragon and the mage, both sides must try their best to maintain a balance and not be able to make a threatening agreement. A strong mage will obviously make the agreement unbalanced, so no dragon will promise this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Siegel nodded. He turned and left, but was stopped by the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! If the color dragon is coming (black dragon, red dragon, etc.), it is estimated that a spit will hit you, our metal dragon (gold, Silver, bronze dragon, etc.) have to speak a little, so explain it to you. Siegel, the dragon that can promise to help you does not exist, unless you have your own dragon. But if you use the dragon spell, it means A comprehensive, endless war. As a teacher, you may have a way to live, but human beings as a race, the final end will be worse than the snakes of the past. Do you know the ending of the snakes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know. Because you claim to have a bloodline of a high dragon, try to ascend to God, seize the Dragon King, and then be destroyed. It is estimated that there are at most thousands of people now, scattered and hiding in Underground world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Golden Dragon blinked and smiled at Siegel: "So, your request is a solution." Unless you already have your own dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completion, the dragon opened his mouth, see a visitor, the Siegel kicked out. However, his suggestion is already very obvious, that is, let Siegel go to find the dragon girl. But why would he suggest that Capricorn is the "Mage of the Master"? Remember that the original agreement was to hand over the ownership of St. Joseph to Siegel, not including the dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is the ownership of St. Joseph, in fact, Siegel also gave up. He used his elemental rune array and energy focusing lens to help the dragon girl grow up, in exchange for helping to defend the city and protect her family. Living together for a long time, everyone has cultivated the trust and feelings of a family member. Besides, there is no power to restrain the dragon girl. How can she say that she is a "master's dragon"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, maybe you can try it after you go back, or invite Capricorn to study high-level spells together, which may be a good idea for a roundabout. After the dwarf meeting, Siegel was ready to do this. Moreover, knowing that the wall of the storm is the world's destruction storm, the high-transmission technique that can leave the world is also a retreat for the family and oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about this possibility while coming to the cabin where the elves rested. As he expected, the elf entertained him with a closed door. Well, they gave a more formal explanation: "The elves who participated in the meeting can only deal with the war related to the dwarf war, and can't decide the relationship with other aspects. So the elves have been strictly ordered, except for the Dwarf Kings Conference. In addition, you must close the door to thank you. No matter who they are, the elves can only express their regret and hope to contact them again later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
