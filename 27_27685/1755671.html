			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel initially thought that this voice was an illusion, an echo that was left in the mind after facing the void for a long time. But why is it the Dragon language, not his mother tongue, the lingua franca of the Star Kingdom? Is the illusion not always a native language? He stopped and waited for a while, and heard the voice coming from the underground again: "Can you save me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage bowed his head and his feet were smooth and horny. Floor. This is the remains of a huge creature, so naturally there is a difference between in vitro and in vivo. Siegel felt that he had become stupid, and he should have thought that there might be complicated structures under the ground. He took out the dust of the stars, slammed it down in the most sparsely green place, and then cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight stagnation in the hand, the stratum corneum was very tough, but the hardness was not as good as steel, and it was quickly cut. Below the transparent outer casing is a network of approximately half-arm depth, and then the cavity below. Siegel saw the roads and walls paved with steel and supported by stone pillars at intervals. There are only a few green plasma lines, wrapped in a thick layer of amber-like glue, emitting the same light as an oil lamp, and it will not hurt people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aluminum-gray guy stood on the ground and looked up at Sigel who jumped down. He is about a meter tall, like a child, with his head and cubes together, with elongated metal arms and legs. It is a combination of mechanics and flesh and blood, like a square box stuffed with meat. Lever, gears and other transmissions are outside the body, forming joints, and other places are covered with small rivets; a pair of round glass eyes are nested with two pairs of thick lenses, and different combinations are used at different times; In the upper part of his square body, there are short wings, but it looks like a broken fan, I don't know if I can fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of konjac, flesh-and-blood creature, whose duty is to take care of its own master: a plane, a mechanical position symbolizing eternal order surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a worker, the konjac will continue to repair the mechanical plane. Make sure they are working properly. This is the embodiment of the power of order, the beauty of the gear that perfectly fits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel descended from above and saw the wound on the top of the guy’s head: a fist-sized hole running through the top of the cube, melting Under the rolled metal. Inside the wound illuminated by the electric spark, a piece of a flaming soul crystal is inserted inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, the soldier who is willing to help, I am very happy to know you." His speech is very fast. After listening to it, he needs to think about it before he can understand that he said what. "What's new in the world today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels dangerous to talk to this person. But still involuntarily said: "What kind of things count as fresh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Right! Everyone's standards are different." The square's walking head is endless: "I saw that the egg fell on the head yesterday, I feel very fresh, but today is not necessarily, tomorrow is even more unnecessary. After reading it for hundreds of times, it will definitely not. It will be fresh! But should it be counted as not fresh from that time? It may be a while after reading it for a while, and then feel fresh! Oh, this is a great proposition that helps to understand the characteristics of the soul. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept talking, and Siegel didn't care to listen, but to observe the surroundings. Nexus hollowed out the body of the giant creature. The support structure was rebuilt with resources plundered from various worlds. The passage here bends like a blood vessel in a living body. Siegel looked closely for a while and found that the passage was still slightly twisted with the vibration of the Nethership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only very weak elemental energies that are insufficient to support the release of spells. If you use the magic array, you need to wait a long time to gather spells like energy missiles. Siegel tried it. If only electric energy is used as the energy to construct a spell, he can release the electric ball as an attacking means, but there is no energy missile to track the hit characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity is a direct and rapid force that is reflected in the spells of the Master and the Priest. Fortunately, the original lightning-like spells have been enhanced, such as electric claws and lightning beams. However, the soldiers' modified body is very resistant to lightning. These spells should not have a real killing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you know that the empty ship has internal space, the next step should be to find the "spider" that Monroe said. Fortunately, there is a dust of stars available at hand, and it is always possible to open a path in this place. He was about to get on the road, but he noticed the sound coming from the top of his head. The konjac with a hole in his head is still talking: "It is very important to keep curiosity. In order to learn things, you can keep improving. In order to remain curious, you can delete the knowledge you have learned before. It is also necessary to let yourself see the unknown again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scenery was turned upside down, but it was not much different from the previous ones. Siegel tried the wall again and found that he could stand up directly. Every fixed plane in this place can walk, unless it touches other planes, it will still fall to the plane angle when leaving. This has created a great obstacle to the direction of discrimination. If there is still a "stone pillar" here, Siegel can't even get up and down and left and right. The channel is not flat, and the slight angular distortion accumulates to completely change the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of the deceitful squad of the gnome Dingbao, and through the accumulation of subtle changes, unconsciously formed a qualitative change. If this is the case, then getting lost is certain. Siegel licked the konjac and pressed his mouth. "Shut up and answer my question!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac licked his eyes. Agree to agree. His face is long on his body, so he can't make a nod gesture—it's another thing—so he agrees and disagrees with a wink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you, what are you doing here?" Siegel asked. In order to prevent him from starting a long story, add a sentence: "Abridged version!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a konjac, number... (He looked up at Siegel, Decided to give up the recitation code), you can call me toot, beep, or call me two. I wandered around the world, and then I got caught here, now like other Nerikes. Finish the ground here, maintain Everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you just call for help?" Siegel put the long sword on the head of the konjac and tapped it to lightly The sound of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it’s boring." Two devils said: "I saw you through perspective, when you were staring at the void. I want to ask you to see it. What. Why can I keep my attention to nothing at all? I want to learn this ability and I will never be bored again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You I have a lot of ideas, but I can't teach you.” Siegel said helplessly: “Do you know how to get to the Nether Ship Minaret?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Look at the eyes: "I know, but it is very dangerous, it is best not to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is a master there. He won't like me." The konjac replied: "But I can take you there, you are not dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be more dangerous than you! Although Siegel thought this way, he nodded and followed the konjac all the way. While he was walking, he talked about his story to the endless stream. First, as a worker, working in a place full of clocks and machinery, and later because of a mistake into the portal to a place called Achesta. "The people there are very good to me, but they are all dead." Didu said: "You found the world and then destroyed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am new to the name of this world," Siegel: "This matter has nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be a new birth Warrior. No wonder you still don't recognize the road. Maybe your body comes from that world, so we may be worthy of being a fellow." The second dance said: "Although it is the hometown of the second hometown, we are finally familiar. No?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk through the twisted passages, the repetitive scenes are boring, and the gravity that exists in all directions makes Siegel quickly lose its direction. Feeling, he has long been unable to distinguish between the top and bottom, and can't remember where it passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes I feel that the void is terrible, but sometimes I feel that the repetition is more and more terrible." Two rhoss said: "I have used it for a long time. I realized the road system here and found the trick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see the number and the street sign. How did you tell the difference?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the benefit of having a nose, sir, I can smell the smell." Two toes pointed to their soft, flat nose, very proud to say To: "There is always a smell in the digestive room. The green pool in the pump room smells sour, the workshop smells good smell of oil, and the place where the ruler is is sweet and greasy. Maybe the ruler likes the cake, maybe, or maybe Is it sugar? Honey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
