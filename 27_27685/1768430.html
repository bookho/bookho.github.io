			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Siegel who came to the Red Master Tower in Hubburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to get through the elf’s eyeliner. Janet is good at make-up and finds a servant with a close-fitting appearance as a Siegel. It can be done once in the territory. In any case, Siegel spends most of his time studying magic in the castle, and most of his work is left to others. As long as Janet, Zucker, Fitzak and others are there, the territory will not be chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure brought by the elves is getting bigger and bigger, and three lords in the South have lost their territory. Two of them, because they did not pay attention to the storage of food, launched an assault on the elves in the despair caused by hunger. No one knows the specific battle process, but the castles of the two lords are no longer defended. The peasants in the territory were driven by the ancient trees of war. They did not go east and north to the seaport, but instead turned westward and deeper into the interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to create greater food pressure for the southern lords, forcing them to surrender as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move is very effective, and soon there is another lord who chooses to surrender. The condition for his surrender was to allow all of his enemies to travel to Ximu Town, where they boarded Shanghai to return to the Old World. The elf agreed to this condition and let the road open, allowing the lord who laid down the weapon to leave with the inhabitants he ruled. In the propaganda of the elves, this is a lord of kindness, kindness, and understanding of affairs. Other human lords should learn from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siguel knows at this time that if he does not find some trouble for the elf, the fighting spirit of the lords will soon fade away and he will no longer be able to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox Commonwealth has not demonstrated its strength, they are still waiting to see, which is expected in Siegel. For the sake of the present, only pull him into the water, so that the common will be exposed. Fortunately, Siegel also knows most of the means of confederation. He plans to sneak into the Tower of the Tower of the Fort, and look for opportunities here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage tower has already completed the construction of the protection circle, and the entrance is protected by complex spells. It is impossible to move hard. Siegel does not know the order of the entrance and exit here. Although he is a member of the federation, he certainly cannot show his true body. Fortunately, the passage that remained in the ground was still there. Siegel drilled in from the wall of the well, carefully not touching the surrounding detection spells, and chose to enter the interior of the Master Tower when the night was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the robe of the Masters Union, put the magic badge on your chest. He became the official mage of the federation. Using makeup techniques instead of illusions, he simply changed his appearance and continued to use his pseudonym "Sos". Most mages like a quiet and independent environment, and rarely talk to each other except to explore spells: Keeping your secrets is the most important skill of the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s normal for a mage to encounter a mage that he doesn’t know. They often use other tools to identify each other. The magic badge on the chest of Siegel and the wizard's gown on the union can't be faked. No one would think that his vision would be stronger than the detective spells at the Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help," Wendy said. "It’s too tired recently, some awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hands to work." Siegel is always a kind smile. In this mage tower, smile is a powerful weapon. Numerous laughter circles on the open space outside the tower, under the secret connection of the Knox Commonwealth, can amplify the power of smile. Joy is harmless to the human body, and as long as you know some of the skills of Knox spells, you can call the power of the law matrix and influence others in a subtle way without being detected by emotional protection spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this approach has no effect on the people of Knox. Those bald heads are more refined than Siegel. If not, he does not have to spend a lot of time looking for another goal. Siegel first observed for a period of time. Among the more than forty different class mages in the tower, the Union of the specialization of this protection department is the best breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-introduction, I am Soss, specializing in the spell." Siegel nodded and said: "I just came here, I am going to the top. Room, I am very glad to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, sorry, I am too rude." Wendy was a little confused. I quickly introduced myself and hoped that I could take a walk with Soth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this fun?" Siegel walked with Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very fresh statement. Some are like pastor's thinking." Wendy was very curious: "How did you adjust yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, meditation is a good way.” Siegel blinked and smiled and said: “I will spend some time meditating, but avoid always thinking about spells. Instead, I will remember what happened in the past, change my mood, and learn from it. , sorrow, hope, and fear, gain strength from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is power in fear?" Wendy couldn't help herself. She has fear of many things, and the Necromancer is just one of them. After becoming an orphan, there is no protection around, and everything in the world is a threat to her. Fortunately, she has a talent for spells. By working hard from the most common apprentices, she finally became a formal mage after several decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you simply shiver, you won't gain strength." Siegel is tempted, his words accompanied by a smile, in this mage tower There is an inexplicable and powerful force in it. “When you admit your fear and find the roots of fear, understand and learn it, you will find that it can help you use magic like other emotions.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give me a detailed explanation?" Wendy felt that she was eager to know the secret of this method, so the voice became urgent. She found her rudeness and began to apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand and said that he didn't care. They have come to the door of the room at the top of the tower, and the face statues on the bronze metal doors look at them with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Wendy, I have my own mission here. I must know that the task is the first priority. It is better to tell me your room, I am going Looking for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Wendy’s heart has some resistance to this matter, I don’t know why I finally put down my vigilance. She said the whisper of her room in the ear of a "new friend", as excited as doing something terrific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook hands with him, then turned and pushed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left Wendy with a charming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then at the moment the gate closes, it becomes Wendy's look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the metal gate was closed, it seemed to be closed like the sun and the warmth, the whole world was dimmed, and Wendy became a stunner. She didn't have to look back, she felt that there was a black shadow in the red wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beating of the heart began to accelerate, and she tried to take a few deep breaths and try to think about something happy. I don't know how, the smile of the new friend "Sos" entered his mind and made her feel much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some strength at the foot, Wendy finally turned around, and there was no shadow on the red crystal tower. She was surprised and confused. She only wanted to get new friends to get comforted and solve the problems in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she lost interest in continuing to inspect the protective enchantment of the Master Tower. Anyway, the elves dare not attack this, and the spell enchantment is not so easy to damage. Why not return to the room at this time, try to remember meditation and see if there is any effect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you experience it yourself, you can say more, more detail, and longer. An inexplicable feeling of happiness hit her heart. She suddenly felt that she should change her clothes to be more suitable for meditation, so that she could... can...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was thinking Go back to your room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two members of the Knox Association in the top floor room, sitting in the sofa facing each other when Siegel pushes the door, whispering what. These are two apprentice mages, and they can't wear the formal gown's robes. According to the truth, they should get up and salute to Siegel, at least first nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them glanced at Siegel, whispered the voice and said a few words, then stood up and prepared to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel made a look that didn't care, went straight to the bookshelf here - he now uses Wendy's appearance, naturally like the woman. Some are timid, careful, and frightened. This is how Wendy feels to others, and there is no aggressiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
