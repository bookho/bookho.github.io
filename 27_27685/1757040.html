			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's restoration work was basically completed after a long period of effort, and the entire transmission array looked like a model, and it was ready to start experimenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac ran around in excitement, and his physical injury was almost as good. Siegel calculates the time through the speed of his recovery, knowing that at least several weeks have passed. When it is time to go home, I hope that some will go well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on the rune array, and then took out a piece of inflammatory soul crystal to introduce energy into the conveyor. The "long angle" makes a squeaking sound, the lines formed by the plasma gradually light up, and the energy is introduced into the gems on the slate. Siegel carefully observed that the gemstone he repaired and manufactured had withstood the load of energy and looked very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to travel!" The konjac shouted loudly, hiding behind Siegel. He has asked thousands of questions about the destination of the trip, but Siegel's answer will only lead to greater interest. "Besides the darkness is nothingness, I am already bored. I want to see the blue sky, the white clouds and the vast land. I want to see all kinds of small animals. I have to bathe in the river!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let the oil leak out, the fish will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage rushed back and focused Go to the spell. The conveyor moves slowly, creating a static space door on the slate. The green plasma energy firmly binds the space structure that tries to collapse, forming a stable entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Siegel's teleportation, this entrance does not rely on the void—they are already in the void, and naturally cannot open the mezzanine again. The entrance leads to the astral, a space that shines with countless bright stars, made up of meteorites and asteroids. All living things can survive in the astral world, where there is no death. Even if it is maliciously killed by other creatures, the astral will re-construct the body and be exactly the same as when it first entered the astral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a world of endless creativity - but like the void, there is never a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky is like a calm lake under the night sky, with a silver glow. Konjac has eyes wide open. The beauty made him speechless. Siegel didn't want to delay the time. He went to the front of the slate and used his wand to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trip across different worlds, and delivery has no such effect. However, the device that actually completes the transmission is a sturdy device. Siegel only needs to use the spell segment of the teleport to specify the destination. He concentrated his spirits, and his mind was full of pictures of Heim and Mith. The slate found in the Rift Valley is in the storage room of the city of Mith, and it is hoped that the magical device of Nissan can still be positioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky gradually began to distort, forming a swirling pattern, and the entire device began to vibrate. However, this room has obviously been designed accordingly. The vibration did not affect the structure of the virtual ship. Siegel sang a curse loudly. The mage's robes fluttered like a banner under the force of fullness. The energy of elemental magic and the formation of plasma formed against each other, but eventually formed a stable structure. At the same time, an earthquake occurred in the city of Mire, and the soldiers who were attacking the city were shaken down. The rolling stones and boiling water also lost their bondage and took a lot of lives. . The elemental rune matrix received interference, and the earth element giant used for defense suddenly collapsed, exploding stones and dirt like a storm. Fortunately, it is in the enemy. Most of the damage caused by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel City is under attack, and the coalition forces of the southern lords are assembled to form a siege team of more than 30,000 people. The imaginary undead did not come, and the Knox Association did not show signs yet, but the human civil war began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen "Westward Dwarfs" stood on the wall, they became the backbone of defense, and few soldiers were able to support five rounds under their attack. The archers trained by Elf Lia, although small in number, can form effective kills. The original patrol team, under the leadership of Mana and Zucker, worked hard on the defense line. With the help of the sturdy and hard-to-climb wall protection, I finally stood firm in front of fifty times the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden earthquake shocked everyone, and the offensive side just took advantage of this incident to retreat. In the castle's bedroom, Janet is struggling with abdominal pain. The bean's sweat fell from her forehead. The torn pillow was thrown aside and the sheets were full of sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the child is not born, someone thinks it is only temporary." Rhett said in a low voice: "Don't worry, calm down, you will feel better."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is under attack. The residents of Heim’s collar are taking refuge in the underground warehouse. How can Janet calm down? The children in their stomachs are very lively, and they feel that the vibrations outside will thrash, and it seems that they have to fight for their father. Thinking of Serge, who had been missing for a long time, Janet sighed, but finally calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven Baron has been alive and kicking, except for the inexplicable experience of frequent vomiting half a year ago, other times are very smart. "This shows that Siegel is fine," Capricorn comforted her like this, and Janet hoped and prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Siegel is not there, the southern lords united and attacked Heim’s collar on the grounds of “breaking the blockade of evil forces” and demanded that the trajectory be removed across the ore avenue. The arrow tower and the city wall. Already under the city, it is useless to say anything, only a choice of fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn is very angry about someone hitting the door, jumped on the wall and then used Longwei. As a result, the entire Heim collar chicken flies, except for a few dwarves and the magic statue Reid, all other creatures fell to the ground, being crushed by fear, unable to suppress the crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was the hardest hit, almost fainted. After that, as long as the Capricorn exerts Longwei, no matter how she controls the direction and intensity, the baby will be unusually active, causing Janet's pain. And the number of enemies is dozens of times more than the defenders, and the speed of recovery is also faster. Longwei, which does not distinguish between me and the enemy, will only cause more trouble. If there are only fearless dwarves on the wall, there is no rotation substitute, and it is impossible to persist in the battle. Therefore, Capricorn smashed the power, and even did not dare to change, Long Wei also converge, promised to shoot only in the most urgent moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn Siegel, where did you go!" Janet glared at the Raven, who hid his head under his wings. I can't hear anything. "Smelly man. The children are born soon, not coming back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earthquake reoccurs, although it is weaker, it is still acutely perceived by everyone. “The surrounding elements are somewhat disordered. It seems to be caused by the earthquake.” Capricorn said: “I went out to see if there were masters in the enemy’s front, I could call those half-elfs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, those wizards are too comfortable to hide in their library, and they should be allowed to do their part," Janet replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder shook his head. He snorted and said: "Someone went to look for them. They said that they would not use spells to deal with non-casters unless they were threatened. Some people think they are very cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, Rhett, don't worry too much, the southern lords have a hard time attacking the wall." Janet sat up in bed, and the maid helped put a pillow on her back. After the pain, her spirit gradually improved. After drinking a cup of warm water, she said to the Golem: "You don't need it here, go see if there are any wounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone understands." Reid bowed and carefully squeezed out the door. Step onto the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of his feet more than 20 meters, the black slate is shining, and a passage has been established. At the other end of the passage, Siegel could not move forward in one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cold force wall blocked his footsteps, and he dominated the front and looked cold at him. The elemental impact consumes most of its physical strength, and the erosion of the void causes it to fall into a trough. In order to be able to return to the Nethership, the psychic abilities are also exhausted. It never felt so weak, and the fear of death returned to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hatred of the Master has even overshadowed the hatred of the exile in an instant. It takes tens of years to torture, devour, and abuse, but Never give death. first timing. The lord wants to strip the mage's ability to control the body, but Siegel, who feels dangerous, immediately becomes paralyzed, avoiding the body being controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning and losing is only a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately took a step toward the transmission channel, and the dominant force field wall came with it. Blocked in front of him. The mage immediately turned back and looked at the energy ball in the distance. The wand in his hand flicks, and the energy fluctuations are obvious. As long as a qualified mage can understand this spell: any door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
