			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepwater City has a total of thirteen masked lords, seven of whom are resident and handle daily affairs. Their masks have powerful anti-detection magic, and any attempt to detect their true identity is futile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no absolute thing in the world, and the magical effect of the mortal does not mean that the gods can do nothing about it. If a pastor prays to God and wants to know the secret, he may get an answer if he pays enough. In the past, there have been cases in which the masked lord was assassinated. The killer sent by the Lord of Shadows proved that his power is higher than the wisdom of the Master. After that, the masked lords added protective spells and instant escape spells to the mask to deal with the assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart people will find that the knowledge of the magical items possessed by the lords is not enough to accomplish such a task. All masks are produced and improved by the Masters Association. bear. Therefore, there is a saying in the marketplace, the identity of the masked lord is in addition to themselves, the Masters Association is also clear. For this, the Federation never admits, but members of the Masters Association know that there is indeed a three-person team responsible for the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the effect of the mask, and the head of the trio is the bachelor Faranis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is responsible for this group after the death of the bachelor? Siegel didn't know the arrangement. Now, Casper, who wants to come to the Knox Association, is most likely to take over this matter. In terms of ideological control and anti-control, who else is more authoritative than him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hopes that this is not the case, and Lion King can retain the last vigilance and reason and will not hand over this group to Casper. If Caspar mastered the manufacture of the mask, he would soon be able to control the masked parliament and make Deepwater City his puppet. Siegel remembered this thing. After returning to the city of Mith, you must ask the half-evil Master Idis, which is related to the relationship between Heim and Deepwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Dennis, the two marched northwest and turned west after entering the grasslands. They entered the desolate and empty wilderness, where the road was difficult. In addition to the snakes lurking in the saline-alkali land, they could not see other creatures for a long time. The main reason for this is that a "poison river" flowing down the wall of the city wall carries a huge amount of salt, alkali, minerals and toxins, and cuts an unsightly scar on the grassland. The soil on both sides of the river is polluted. Nothing can grow. Therefore, there are no animals inhabiting nearby, and no human smoke is seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river of the Poison River is always a mixture of green and yellowish brown, which gives off a disgusting taste. Sometimes the material in the river produces an alchemical reaction that rises out of dangerous toxic fumes, sometimes red and sometimes blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks of the river are white and salty. Normal soil is not seen at all. The poisonous river is sometimes flooded. Over the original river embankment, a large amount of poison will be left on the shore, causing a large area of ​​grass. When the horseshoe is stepped on, the ground will make a cracking sound, giving people a painful feeling of biting a small stone while eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people riding on this terrain can be much faster than on the grasslands. The saline-alkali area is flat and there is no possibility of hooking the grass of the horse's legs, and looking at the place where there is no ambush. They spent the whole day trekking in this terrain, at night. Siegel took the water from the space bag and shared it with the mount. He will let the earth element guards watch the night at night, and wrap the horse mouth with a cloth before going to sleep. If these mounts accidentally eat poisonous minerals, they may soon lose their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked west for four days, and the Wall Mountain appeared again in the field of vision, but a tribe in Siegel did not see it. Then they turned to the north and came to a river where they could drink horses. At this time, Siegel felt overwhelmed: originally it should be the settlement of the Jackdaw tribe, but now don't talk about tents, even the footprints of the people can't see a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lia, where do you think they will go?" Siegel asked: "There are thousands of tribes. It is impossible. Did it disappear from the grassland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf jumped from the horse and walked to the river at a light pace. She took a handful of water, sipped it gently, and then sniffed the smell of the air. "They are still upstream. There is still a long way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should not?" Siegel held his chin, wondering: " There is nothing in the upstream direction. It should be a wilderness similar to the Poison River. What do they go there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. William, the travel mages and collector, he painted the entire terrain of the grasslands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea chuckles, “The one prefers the use of spells instead of legs. People who go to see the world? He can even draw a map of our Elf Forest. You also count on the topographic map of the grassland? Siegel, you remember that in addition to the map of the elves, only the dwarf drawings can be trusted. Other races, Including humans, you don't have enough patience to draw the correct map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she returned to the horse and went away. Siegel followed, and he was carrying two spare mounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley is getting narrower and narrower, the water flow is getting more and more urgent, and the sides start to rise from the river like a ditch. Siegel and Leah rode above the ditch. They were so far-sighted that they finally saw the faint smoke column in the west direction and finally confirmed that it was indeed inhabited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people left the river and marched straight in the direction of the rising pillar of smoke, riding into the endless plain. It has already been snowed, and most of the grass on the ground is hidden. Only when the horseshoes pass, the blades of grass and soil will be turned out together. Elf Lia narrowed her eyes and he saw a shadow moving rapidly on the horizon. The shadow is just in the direction of the wind, so the elf erects his ears and listens carefully to the sound of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while she figured out that the shadow was a lot of cavalry. Their horseshoes were so fast and powerful that the long guns in their hands reflected the needle-like light in the sun. If there is a raven here, Siegel can be farther and clearer than the elf sees. But only relying on the naked eye, the racial superiority of the elf is undoubted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cavalry," Leah said: "They move very fast, basically in our direction."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if it is an enemy or a friend." Siegel said: "I think we should be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairy nod, minus Slow horse speed. If this encounter is inevitable, it will not be wrong to leave some physical strength for the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel began to recite the spell, and the wand made a mysterious mark in the air. He is prepared to display the invisible group, so that both of them will be covered. The energy of magic gathered at the top of the wand, and the pattern of the spell was successfully completed. But when the spell is about to take effect, all the magical fluctuations are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange phenomenon is still encountered for the first time, but this does not want to make any mistakes in the spell. Siegel carefully recalled the spell and then carefully thought about the process of condensing magic power. ‘It seems that there is nothing wrong! He used this spell again and was more cautious. The spell can still collapse at the moment of its entry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry is getting closer and closer, and the elves have been able to count their numbers. "There are a total of twenty rides, they have studded leather and good rifles. The heads are fat and big and look extremely strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do they have any flags?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The elf replied: "If I see it, I will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses magic again, his most skilled summoning fire element. He is very sure that there is nothing wrong with his summoning spells, but he can't make magical energy last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame that disappeared in the air caused the attention of the elf. She looked at Siegel curiously. "What happened?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't use magic." Siegel frowned and replied: "Invisible ball and summoning elemental creatures have failed. This place is weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf heard the words, stroking the leaves of the chest with your fingers, gently chanting the spell, calling for the power of the moon. As a Ranger, Leah gained a certain spell power by praying to the Moon God. She inspires the spell given by Luna, trying to condense the fruit that can heal the wound in her hand, but the spell still fails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't use spells either," said Lia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered the blind to open the visual, this is all normal. He used the pair of reinforced eyes to observe the surroundings, and no trace of magical fluctuations was found. Then he uses the spell again, and can see that with his spell, the power of magic condenses, composes the correct spell structure, and then reverts to nothingness at the moment of release. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
