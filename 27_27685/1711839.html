			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the arena of the arena again, the whole city has fallen into a melee. There were four burning fires in the south and west, and the wooden houses collapsed in the dazzling fire. Because of the guilt caused by grievances, ordinary orcs can't tell whether the same family around them is possessed. The nature of suspicion and the ferocious nature make them quickly kill each other. In the beginning, it was only to eliminate potential enemies. Later, some orcs began to robbed and robbed. As a result, the situation was difficult to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops of the three-eye warlord are also confused. When the witch festival has not arrived, hundreds of people have already died, and nearly two hundred are attached. body. The grievances, despite the evil chaos, will not kill each other. The two hundred people suddenly dispersed and they will dissipate thousands of troops. Several orc captains rushed to the front and tried to stabilize the situation. The grievances rushed up and quickly attached them, causing the grassroots officers of the army to lose control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the strong and powerful body of the orcs, the liberation slaves led by Siegel are much weaker and will not attract the attention of the spirits. Even though the Master is very careful, he understands that the enemy in front of him can be more than the orcs and the grievances. The burning flames of the house illuminate the way for the entire team, and Siegel walks in front and leads them to the nearest dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the alarm in the city, the residents left the house and came out to check the situation. They saw the warhammer in the hands of Siegel, and the greed was revealed in his eyes. Siegel saw the danger. He knew that although there were hundreds of people behind him, there was no warrior in the war. Now, after the attack, there may only be a runaway, and they must find ways to establish them as soon as possible. The courage to fight. Siegel thought of it, raised his wand and recited the curse of summoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low and thick voice seems to be coming from under the feet, constantly shaking the slate floor. Siegel raised his hands and fired the flames of the warhammer. Then he saw the flames in the cracks of the slate, then gathered and condensed into four wolves. This is a variant of the wolf from Hell, and Siegel summons their imaginary projection body. Compared to summoning a fire ox or other large monster, it is more suitable for the current situation than a large number of more agile helpers. As Siegel whistled, the three fire wolves shielded each other and rushed to the half-orcs. The huge and strong body was extremely flexible and launched a round offensive from different angles. The exposed teeth are as bright as the hot daggers; the low squats in their throats are like the roar of the blacksmith's bellows. For the half-orcs without armor, the battle was short and bloody. They didn't have time to wave their simple weapons and they were thrown down. Then the fire wolf would pounce on them and bite their throats. A few orcs can't see the situation, want to escape, but the fire wolf is chasing after him, even the most awkward disguise can not get rid of these fierce hunters. The escaper's leg was bitten, and he stumbled forward. The exclamation sound had not been screamed for a long time, and the wolf rushed forward to bite his back neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellfire wolves can't eat in the state of being summoned, so their goal is only killing. Siegel is very calmly commanding these summons. He knows the limits of the fire wolf's ability: he can handle the civilians and the armorless orcs. Once faced with a team formed by a battlefield or a shooter, the power of these wolves will be Will be greatly limited. The original purpose of the mage was not to confront the orc army. He would not be stupid enough to cause too much attention and be encircled. After expelling the onlookers, he decisively chose to move forward in places with more shops next to the arena. In the middle of the night, there are only a few slaves who look after the shops. They are not as populous as the military camps and residential areas, and there are plenty of goods here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel hammered the door of the grocery store with a warhammer, and the fire wolf snapped the chain on the blacksmith’s door, all of which were piled up inside. Opened to the team. "Men's hurry to find weapons to protect the body, take shields without armor, we have to go on board! Others take food and water, don't take more, don't affect the speed of progress." Master's voice is not loud, but With the help of spells, it can be clearly transmitted to everyone's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two half-orc slaves headed to Siegel, and were arrested by the alert. These two orcs were brothers, and they were sold as slaves because they followed the warlord's failure to compete with the power of the three-eye Longte. They were also one of the relatively strong players in the Siegel team. When the weapons were distributed before, these two orcs were also the smartest people who first armed themselves. When Siegel saw that they had something to say, they let Zucker temporarily retreat. “The time is limited, and the long story is short.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you really a human aristocrat from the South?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are definitely going to the harbour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to leave here, but we won't go to the human city with you. If you can find a place to put us down safely, then we can help you deal with the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Fair and reasonable." Siegel heard the Raven's alarm and knew that a ten-member orc squad was approaching. "I will sail and sail, so you have to pick up the weapon and follow me and kill all the roads!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in agreement."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ravens alert the Master again through the Mind Link. The team of orc soldiers was fully armed, armed with iron shell armor, three with knife shields, three with spears, three with bows and arrows, and the last one with both hands. They avoided the fire area and moved from the military camp to the arena, just a row of houses separated from Siegel. The gap between the houses is enough for a carriage to pass, and it is naturally impossible to block the line of sight and sound. There are more than one hundred people in this area, it is hard not to be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late to let everyone hide, so this time you need precise casting, and the wand that is not easy will have the opposite effect. So the wizard inserted the wand back on the belt and found a piece of wool from the bag of the spell material. With his left hand, he slammed the wool in his palm and sang a spell close to his lips. At the same time, he constantly monitors the progress of the orc squad through the Ravens and carefully calculates the time they arrive at the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed the illusion. A row of fake goods collapsed, layers of boxes and bottles blocked the street, and several of them also read the words "light oil and wax, away from fire." Then he ordered a fire wolf to jump on the side of the roof and use his flaming figure to shift the line of sight of the orc team. Although the wizard's illusion is far more complicated, realistic and superb than the street artist's magic, the blind eye is still indispensable. The orc squad was immediately drawn to the line of sight, and an archer quickly bent and bowed. Siegel had been prepared to let the fire wolf jump before the arrow was shot, avoiding the risk of being shot. At the same time, he concentrated his spirits, twisted the spells, and burned the obstacles formed by the illusion. In order to be more realistic, his illusion has a burning sound, and the flame also radiates a warm feeling. Siegel ordered the wolf howling, and then added the cry of the orc fighting and the painful roar in his own illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike human knights, orc soldiers only know how to complete a mission and never waste time helping others. The leader's knife and shield orc looked at the blocked street, and the burning fire wall made him unable to see the situation across the street. He will not go to the burning obstacles to kill the wolves on the opposite side, and most wonder where the flame creatures come from. Through the eyes of the raven, Siegel knew that the orcs had not stopped, and did not notice more than a hundred escaped slaves, but continued to move toward the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people in the team still don’t know that they were almost discovered by the orcs, immersed in the excitement of possessing weapons and supplies, only a few close to Siegel The individual saw what had just happened. After the wizard's spelling was completed, the half-orc brothers re-examined the young man in front of him with awe, and feared the power he had mastered. They have heard the legends of the Southern Methodists, especially the orcs who survived the Battle of the Great River, the fireballs, lightning and poisonous fog they said. Although the end of these stories is "the great beastmaster God let his faithful slave servant drive away the danger", but the magical power of the Master still left a deep impression on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at each other and nodded with a heart. Originally they planned to kill Siegel and Zucker, and then led the entire team, and lost their sincerity to the three-eyed warlords, so as to get rid of the identity of the slaves and join the army to begin the promotion of the rank. But after knowing that Siegel was a mage and saw his magical spells, they really felt hope for the first time. Hopefully they could leave Macabu alive and start living freely elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow up, keep up, don't talk nonsense!" The two orcs beat and kicked and calmed the villagers. They entered the team and gave a few words to the gladiators who were familiar with them. Soon, these half-orcs with certain combating ability formed a backbone, and finally let this team no longer be like a loose sand, at least able to move quietly and orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven flies in front of the team, but does not dare to fly too high. The orc archer is always the biggest threat, and Siegel has been very careful about the feather arrows that are shot in the dark. They accidentally found five longbows and more than forty arrows in a grocery store, and the hunters who are proficient in shooting can play a bigger role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the team that escaped was not a familiar soldier of Siegel, so in order to make the half-orcs in the team obey the command, the wizard let them follow the fire wolf, I am always in charge of the war. These half-orcs allowed them to use long-range weapons after killing some of the orcans who had blocked the road and smashing the door and searching through the blacksmith shop to show a strong will to fight. For the Master, the cold arrow behind it is always the biggest threat. Even though Siegel has applied a protective spell to himself, it can't be taken lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
