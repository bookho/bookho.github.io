			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole thing has become strange. The so-called secret passage has almost become a well-known thing. Siegel heard it in just one day. twice. He wants "The Moonlight Moya Vol.", this book is in the hands of the lord or in the hands of McGonagall, perhaps only after seeing the female mage. However, Siegel can be sure that the Viscount Prince has never had the possibility to leave Master McGonagall. He can hang the owner of the village on the torture rack. How can there be real kindness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great alert in the heart, but the face of the Master is not showing the slightest flaw, still a calm and curious look. After agreeing to Viscount Pran, Siegel decided to act now, asking the Viscount to take him to the entrance of the secret passage. But Plane was also very careful, just sent a servant to take them to go, and he still solved the dinner that seemed to last forever at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a lantern, black inside." Count Polan sent Siegel to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant took a lantern from the shelf at the door and put it in his hand, then pushed the door open and led the way. Siegel kept paying attention to the servant's figure movement and found that after he left the lamp tower, his body was significantly relaxed. It seems that Viscount Prang has accumulated power in the hearts of servants for a long time, and it is an irreversible existence. I want to come to him to maintain his rule with tough and cruel means, and these servants will not live a good life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being able to determine the emotional changes of the servants is just a convenience for Siegel to use the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the corner of the castle, avoiding the scope of view of all the guards, Siegel quickly casts the charm of human spells. A sweet scent drifted into the servant's nose, allowing his spirit to relax immediately, becoming relaxed and uneasy. Together with the expression of kindness and smile, you can harvest friendship from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why does the crying tower have such a name?" Siegel asked, the charm spell does not mean erasing the memory, it can't help someone to ask afterwards, so he It is also necessary to dig and seduce information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s actually very simple. Because of the disrepair, many of the towers have been damaged, revealing a mezzanine between the walls. Many places have appeared in size. There are different gaps and holes. When the wind blows, it will make a crying sound, hence the name. But this tower used to be called the sea breeze tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, it seems that you have a good understanding of this place." Siegel smiled and praised her: "How long has it been here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born Here, I have been a servant since I was seven years old. It has been twenty-five years." The man said: "It is a good job to serve the Lord Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am also serving the Lord, a very young lord, very kind, and will not hang so many bodies on the criminal shelf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This thing is terrible, but who told them to communicate with the ghost?" The servant grinned. Said: "Since the madman Meg brought a fog, the life here has changed a lot. The land has gradually turned into a swamp, and many places can't go. I have a bold brother who saw walking while rowing in the swamp. The monster. The tall body and countless open arms swayed in the mud and took heavy steps. The monsters made terrible screams, and the waves of water almost knocked over the boat. If you didn't see the plane fast, rush to escape. My brother will be sucked up like many villagers, and the flesh is used as a camouflage when the monsters infiltrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This terrible monster. How do ordinary villagers Dare to contact?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who knows? It’s because they have done this kind of stupidity, so the lord is furious and puts everyone on the prison.” The servant took them to the crying tower and opened the door with the key. He walked and said, "In the face of fear, people don't know what mistakes they will make. At that time, there is no normal thinking. I heard that the village tried. Pass the monsters and let them not rob their villages. But their efforts have attracted the attention of the monsters, their own village is fine, but other more villages along the river were attacked."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These stupid villagers." Siegel’s approval made the servant feel very proud. The power of the charm spell is further deepened and gradually controls him completely. "If you can know how to drive out the fog, solve all the troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." The servant said: "It’s all because of McGonagall. This has led to all this. Tell me the truth, McGonagall is in the dungeon. If you let the outside people know, you have to rush into the anger to cause confusion. In fact, the lord is shutting her, she always wants her Say the way to get rid of the fog. Until now, only the information on the amulet has been obtained, and the palliative is not a cure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Since the Lord of the Lord ordered everyone to use the amulet, the attack has been reduced, and there are no more pretenders. You can finally face others with confidence." The servant said: "Our lord always has The solution is to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amulet is useless at all, even the magic fluctuations are not, just an ornament - expensive decorations. Siegel thought about it, but still did not tell the truth. After all, the villagers also need comfort. At least one of the servants is right, at least the unnecessary suspicions are reduced, and people can get along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the servants have taken them to the entrance of the secret passage. The crying tower is constantly making strange noises, and it keeps ringing. The walls that have been in disrepair for many years have been broken, and many places are simply reinforced with wood and stone. Fortunately, the main wall is still solid, supporting this century-old castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret road is in the position that the informed person said, next to the fireplace, the handrail made on the wall with the iron ladder leads to the deep underground. The servant took out a lantern, lit it in a sheltered place, and handed it to them. He was about to leave, and Siegel took him and asked him the last question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am out, will you wait for me here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, I haven’t received this order, never.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel loosened his hand, took the lantern, and sent the servant away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only Siegel and Moore in the crying tower, the lanterns are shaking in the wind, the light is also swaying, and two people are cast on the wall. Huge shadow. A group of black bats hanged on the ruins of the tower, and were stunned by the light, making a rattling sound like a rat. Moore was very nervous and couldn't help but pull out the long sword and asked: "Adult, do we really want to go down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Head, said to Moore: "Yes, there is only this road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that something is wrong." Moore replied nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You feel right, so keep up with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be covered The lantern was hung around the waist and climbed the ladder first. This is a very narrow passage. The gap left on the walls on both sides is just enough for a person to squeeze in. The back is sore and it seems that the hand will not fall and will only get stuck in the air. It is silent here. There is a moist smell characteristic of the ground. They went about ten meters and came to a channel supported by arches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lifts the lantern and observes it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember how Viscount Plan explained his servants "Take them to the channel of the crying tower, the place where I won't let you go. Let them go to clear the danger inside." Then he immediately sings a single sentence, "Take the lantern", do you still remember it? "Siegel explained to Moore: "There is a torch on the wall, and there is a candlestick at the entrance to the crying tower. Why did you just mention the lantern? The servant picked up the lantern and there was a burning torch on his hand. Why didn't it ignite at the time? Want now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m getting more and more confused.” Moore replied: “You said there is a conspiracy here?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for sure, but I don't know who the plot is." Siegel said, squatting under the wick of the lantern. Just listen to it. A small iron box was pulled out. The two looked down the light and saw some finely ground powder in the iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestures to hold his breath, and then uses the technique to change the shape of the iron box and close the mouth directly. Then he took out the handkerchief and soaked it on his nose and mouth. Moore also learned how he did the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he just breathed a sigh of relief and said to Moore: "The iron box is a kind of powder, but it should be nothing more than toxins or hallucinogenic ingredients. The servant would rather move in the dark courtyard than to ignite the lantern, and I felt that there was something wrong. It seems that the light is burning for a certain period of time, and the burning is no longer the lamp oil, but the substance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plan led the main victims? Why is he?" Moore felt very strange: "We will not cause any trouble to him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
