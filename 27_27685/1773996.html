			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power tower, buried deep in the base of reinforced silver and dense steel, there is a magic array that never stops. ● Hey, you can find almost all kinds of gems here, they will always shine with colorful energy under the influence of magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every gems have different elemental traits. They act as nodes in the magic array and store the corresponding elemental energy. On top of this is a powerful magic enchantment called the spell pool. The wizard's mage can cast magic into the spell pool, and then the spell structure is saved and stored, and the energy contained in the gem is stored in the gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Tower is a spell enhancer with a higher height and a larger coverage. When a federation member needs it, he can connect to the spell pool with a personal magic badge registered with the federation, and call the spell he has stored in it to deal with the unexpected. The defensive enchantment and various special spell effects of the Normal Master Tower are maintained by the energy stored in the gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of years have stored a huge amount of energy, enough for three sergeants to squander for three weeks. This represents a meteor shower that can cover half of the continent, or destroy all towns in the walled mountains twice with a thunderstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost exhausted now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not normal! Casper’s teacher panicked. Two months ago, he opened a big curse, and according to the magical fluctuations in the red spire of the Hubburg, he locked the conspirators who provoked the Federation and the Elven War. This person is very embarrassed, this magical fluctuation is still found by chance, is the only clue. Casper’s teacher decided not to waste time looking for it and use the big curse to solve him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of the magic array was still full at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The teacher was so easy to keep polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is still running, indicating that the person is still alive in a corner of the world. He seems to have found a way to resist, completely bearing the attack of negative energy and various curses. Caspar looked at the composition of the Great Curse and found that there was no problem: there were countless disarms and removal of protective spells in the curse to crack the protective enchantments that the attacker might use, such as immune negative energy or immunity. That is, death and the like. Even a powerful protective spell such as the Aurora Method has long been dispelled, and it is impossible for an attacker to rely on ** to resist a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is because of the nature of this spell. It uses some of the effects of the strongest prophecy spell warning to determine the target attribute. Then start a targeted attack. Only when the attacker is a living creature, a large curse will use negative energy. If the target being targeted is a lich, this spell will automatically be converted to positive energy or an elemental attack that is not immune. This characteristic is the most quintessential part of the Great Curse, and it is also the source of confidence for Casper. Can you still kill the target now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but more strange is the energy consumption of the power tower. The Great Curse is very energy intensive. But this is only relative to a common mage. If you compare the storage of the entire power tower, the big curse should last for a year. Caspar checked that the cost of the curse was exactly the same as in the record, and there was no abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two months, where did the massive spell reserves go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the "Community Big Three" who can enter this control room. There are also protective spell masters Maqige, plastic master Scott and magic tower builder Idis. Majge and Scott have been transformed into loyal members of the Knox Association. Idis went to Heim and never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the Big Three, William is still at the top of Mora, has not come out of the fine gold gate, but can not rule out his suspicion. Lion King Alexander is a person that Caspar can't see. Since the transoceanic transmission was closed, he had lost his news. Is it that he is back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the actual leader of the Big Three, Alexander probably still has some secrets that Caspar does not know. His threat to the action of the Commonwealth is the greatest. The ** division stopped the big curse first. Then check the Three Peaks Tower through the array here to find all the suspicious places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy will not be produced out of thin air, nor will it disappear from the air. What is it used for? This question is like a spike in the nail, which makes Casper uncomfortable. The external enemies and internal enemies let the common association fall into the whirlpool and are pulled to the abyss of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never! Caspar made up his mind. Since the energy reserve is not enough to open the hidden shadow film array for a long time, then the method of re-triggering according to the conditions is adopted, and the use is started when the attack comes. If you still want to keep the Three Peaks Tower, Casper will not be able to stay away. He needs to keep an eye on the movements of the elves and be ready to climb the 520 steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then. Everything is hoping for external elemental energy, supplementing it with the consumption of a part of the array, and then praying for the longer time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always being besieged has put the patience of the sergeant to the limit, and the bad news from Ximu Town and Hubburg is even worse. At present, these two important strongholds have lost their perimeter protection: the elves have broken the wall. The shackles supported by the Federation have surrendered, and the original residents have all become refugees and have been driven out of their homes to the west. Only some fishermen in Ximu Town boarded the boat in advance, and escaped to the sea when they were in chaos, so they were not captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two red-red spires can barely maintain the final defense, and have repeatedly sent for help. If you lose these magic towers. What is left of the Knox Association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar pinched the power of the staff, and the current predicament finally made him determined. The elf's continuous victory must be terminated, and the power that is shared together must be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents the wraith, the emotional circle, and the death knight in the northern part of the walled mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of Red God uses the dragon as a mount to destroy the power of the world. It’s a powerful and proud guy who likes to rest on the edge of the storm wall on weekdays. Let the elves continue to plant trees. When the dragons appear, their war trees cannot fly to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ army is spread over the walled mountains, but their strength is seriously insufficient compared to the vast land. After the Three Peaks Tower attracted a large number of troops, the direction of the Elf Forest showed a gap, but no one had such a strong maneuvering force to attack. The nomadic cavalry on the grassland originally planned to cause trouble to the elves, but the students sent out did not complete the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomads actually found a magical suppression zone and hid inside, intent to avoid the effects of this war. "Holy Land", they are called the magic suppression zone. It is ignorant. Living in such areas will affect their physical fitness from generation to generation, and powerful grassland nomads will eventually become like ordinary farmers, no longer seeing giants and gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter, the dragon is more mobile than the nomadic cavalry. More powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All Masters began to store energy in the spell pool to prepare for the counterattack elves." Caspar's voice echoed in the Three Peaks Tower, and the sound was calm. Contains power. "The elves want to dominate the New World, want to eliminate the way humans learn and master magic, and want to kill our freedom. This is never allowed. Every caster should act to fight for survival and victory!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his orders, several red-red spires all began to shine, attracting the grievances on the North Icefield. For a time, the sky in the north was all gray clouds, and all the creatures were huddled to hide, so as not to be discovered by these terrible souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune-free rune that is banned on the walls of the city has a strong radiance, reflecting the entire hill into a bright red color. Looking from afar, like the carbon burning in the stove, it is hot and difficult to touch. The grievances flew over the walls of the city walls, as if they were burned. Rolling, shouting, and falling black dregs began to decrease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds are falling, and they are thrown at the wall of the city without paying the price. Countless burning grievances turn into black slag, covering the mountains. Gradually, this layer of black is getting thicker and thicker, which isolates the rune power of the wall mountains and forms a passage that can be crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomads of the grasslands are mostly in the vicinity of the Holy Land, away from the direction of Deepwater City, so they avoid the threat of grievances. However, some tribes on the east side of the grassland still saw this wonder. It has already blown up the warm southerly wind, but this dark cloud is still advancing with unstoppable momentum. Covered the entire sky. The cows and horses all bowed their heads, or they trembled on the ground, or stuffed their heads into the tent to escape. Those who look up at the sky, all nausea and vomiting. Still some have been tainted with tyrannical temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
