From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer Alexander's teleportation tears a channel in space, leaving a shallow trace even after the spell ends. With his keen elemental senses, Siegel casts his parsing spells, stuffing his strength into the space cracks, and propping the transmission channel again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Lord!" General Mana led the firearms unit and ran over, just to see Siegel's figure. She couldn't conceal her excitement and shouted: "The Lord Lord, the Magic Knights, the Guns and the City Guard are on call here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw She glanced and shook her head slightly. Although this group of soldiers is loyal and heroic, it does not play a role in the battle against the sergeant. The hard-twisted transmission channel is unstable and can end at any time, and only one or two people can pass, so Siegel only gave Mana a gesture to keep the order of the castle and then jumped into the portal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of a whirlwind, the violent space force squeezed inward, like ocean currents and whirlpools mixed together, trying to break Siegel. The ** commander element escorts himself, forming a layer of protection around the body that separates the forces of destruction. He saw the shadows of the earth, the sky and the mountains turning into hustle and hustle, and everything turned into a white color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fell out of the space channel and slammed into the middle of a snowy field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Alexander was in the place dozens of meters before him, and he came back after hearing the loud noise. "You didn't actually save Wendy? It's a shameless, shameless guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal quiescence and cloning combined, as long as there is still a breath, Never die. Siegel certainly will not tell Alexander about this news, but will take time to observe the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, they came to the middle of a mountain, already standing on the forest line. The wind blew through the snow from the hard, icy rock surface, and it screamed on the element shield. Behind Siegel is a steep slope, and the loose snow is shaken by the power of the space channel to form an avalanche. With a deafening roar rushing down the mountain. Behind the lich is a black cliff with a transparent ice armor. Siegel saw a spiral staircase made of ice and led to a cave entrance with a golden vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are your nest, Alexander." Siegel stood up straight. Active activities shoulders and neck. "You haven't been idle since you fled, have you dig holes in the mountains? Are there any gains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s sly laughter, the sky blue pupil Flickering: "Siegel, you are a ungrateful bastard. Today is your death! You are coming faster than I thought, so the time of death will be earlier!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to lead Siegel into the cave. Use the laid out terrain to trap him. There are anti-magic fields and frenzied magic areas, which is a very troublesome environment for the Master. Because of these two terrains, Alexander can't use the teleportation to go straight into the hole. He can only walk down the ladder and walk up. He estimated that it would take ten minutes for Siegel to leave a review of Wendy's injury, but he did not expect him to catch up in less than a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Siegel’s wife and son being hostages, and having no time to enter the dominant terrain, Alexander had an ominous premonition. However, this did not interfere with his will to fight. After all, Siegel could not bring the magic ship and the secret nuclear. Despite the loss of topography, this is still a fair battle between the divisions. Alexander has never failed in this contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, you know my abilities, as long as I am close, you are finished." Lich's two skeleton claws pinched It’s creaking, and the negative energy sticks like a gel. “Your defensive spells will have no use at all. You are in front of me a poor worm that is naked!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s slamming of the dust of the stars, while casting a magical weapon spell, transforming the wand from a short stick into a long stick. "Do you think that I am the other kind of mage? Is there any ability to fight in close combat? I am afraid that your bones are close to the body? If you say naked, I have a sword, what do you have, a bunch of dog food? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the flame, Siegel radiates light at the top of the long wand, and a sea-blue spherical shield protects him. The shield is as thin as a bubble, but the horrible flame is burning without it. "Elemental spells, you are joking!" Siegel's voice overwhelmed the scream of flames. Between the snow-capped mountains and the sky, I am constantly resounding: "I am a user of elemental aggregates. The four elements have already surrendered. This dark fire can't knock me down! The filth, the evil negative energy cracks the flame, it seems like the power is amazing, to death. Fang is extinguished, but in fact it is only empty in the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not answer, he spit the flame from his mouth, while using his hands to cast spells, he spelled the spell In the flames. In the original dark red fire, the part that belongs to red gradually weakens, but the darkness begins to increase. The Lich moved slowly, forming a series of shock waves that forced Siegel's ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Siegel, the front is not just a flame, but also a variety of spells and spell fragments. If you simply block it by means of preventing fire damage, it will easily be affected by various spells, and various dark curses in your body. However, these cursed spell fragments are not only useful to attackers, but if the level is sufficient, defenders can also use them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes flashed, grabbing the low valley between the two waves of fire and rushing back. He built a simple loop of elements in a very short period of time, and grabbed several spell fragments as materials, combining them into a simple spell structure of eddies and absorption. With this power at its core, Siegel pulls the lich's flame to the side. Like the funnel in the river, all the black torrents converge on the top of the wand, constantly condensing and compressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The object is the opposite, the heat is cold!" Siegel took all the black flames and sighed like a sigh. The cold wind blew, and the black flame turned into a crystal ice in a flash of light. Even in the snow and ice, it is constantly chilling. The ice steadily freezes itself at the top of the wand and becomes an inseparable whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Alexander saw this situation and stunned, and Siegel caught this one of his screams and cast a spell. The ground between the two wizards was already melted by the flames, so the shock caused by the sound waves threw all the mucus-like soil out. Alexander held his hands in front of him. Use force field shields to block the effects of sound waves on your body. A body made up of a single material bone has a single frequency, so it is very easy to be damaged by sound waves. He stopped the shock, but the impact of the sound wave pushed him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although pulling distance can reduce the threat of Alexander, but the distance is far more likely to escape. Siegel put away the spells in advance and walked over with the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneer sneered. Although he does not know why Siegel did not continue to cast spells, he will not miss this opportunity. But just as he had just gathered the elemental energy, an iridescent flash came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron ray? How could it be so fast? Alexander instinctively had a problem with this spell. He didn't dare to use his protective spells to block, but immediately escaped to one side. The four-pulse arrow passed over his feet and then sneaked into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No frost, no flames, no lightning, the spell that just passed is like illusion. But Alexander clearly felt a very tight elemental power. He looked at Siegel and found that he had again condensed the same spell at the top of his wand and waved to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at the mystery! Want to interrupt my spell with this ray?" Alexander looked at the trajectory of the ray and determined that he was aiming at his rib. So he put his legs together and straightened his waist. Lifting the height of your thorax up, just let the rays pass through underneath. Using this action to save time, Alexander began to cast a large cracking spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large lysis is a stronger version of dissociation and is an intermediate step leading to elemental surges. It destroys almost all magic effects in an extremely violent way, clears the energy of all magic items, and completely destroys the stable structure of the magic array. The only difference from the elemental surge is that the big cracking works only on the items and effects of the magical construction, it does not harm the body of the magic user. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the anti-magic field and the rainbow light ball, there is no protective spell to block the big crack. If it is hit by this spell, Siegel's magical equipment up and down. Including his wand will fail and be damaged. At that time, Alexander will gain a great advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
