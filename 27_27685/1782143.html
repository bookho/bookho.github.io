			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two pieces of cheese and a roast sheep? Your father-in-law's tribe is not very rich." Evan squats on the leg of the lamb while snoring Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore pretended not to hear, and continued to clean up the camp with the guards. He already knows the identity of Evan, although Siegel said that he doesn't have to care too much when he gets along with him, but he still looks nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, it is the Majesty of the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron, who sat on the throne, has always been trained as a prince, and has a good reputation in both the nobility and the folk. But the law of the kingdom of the stars, the eldest son has the right to inherit. Although Evan was born as an illegitimate child, he was finally recognized by the king and had already restored his surname, and he was older than Villar. So in the minds of many people, Evan is the one who should sit on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no big deal for the king to say the last two sentences, and he is telling the truth. The living standards of people on this grassland are not high, but the better ones have just solved the problem of food and clothing. It is not because of the natural environment here, nor because the people here are lazy, but all kinds of strange monsters wandering around, it is difficult to deal with the power of the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore is very good at collecting intelligence when he runs out of the outpost. This is a good habit he learned with his grandfather Fazak. According to the legend of the inhabitants of the prairie, the more you go west, the more terrible the monsters are, and the more frequently they appear. The blood-sucking mosquitoes of the size of a hound are overwhelming, and the giant cockroaches that swallow the living are lurking underground. Many villages may be destroyed overnight, and the only thing they can do is to dedicate the god of the wilderness and follow the warnings of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point is close to the walled mountains, and there are no powerful monsters other than the shadow leopards and black bears in the mountains. Moore is very fortunate about this, but also curious about the legendary monsters, I really want to know whether it is true or not. Did the person who came to tell the story in front of him warn him, scare him or simply to defraud the bounty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only believes in Nata, she said that she has not seen the legendary monsters. The closest evidence is just the cheekbones of the monster that was killed. "A huge lava python, the kind that will spurt fire, can open the tent together with the people inside after the mouth is opened. It burns people in the mouth. Then slowly digest." She said herself I only saw the huge skull, and the rest was still hearsay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata tells him about the things on the prairie. Moore told him about the anecdotes in the city. The two people gradually developed feelings and naturally achieved good things. Now only need to beat the competition, you can take her home and stay together every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not as confident as Siegel and Evan, he is not a magician or a king. Following the martial arts learned by Siegel, Leah and others made him a qualified knight, but the distance from the outstanding soldiers is still far away. His comprehensive ability is indeed good, including military organization, castle construction, territorial management and so on. But this is of no use at a simple contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Nata at the time that the contest was definitely a bad idea, but the girl obviously didn’t think so. "Only the strong is the only last word, you have to win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wayward behavior, but if it is re-electability, where? Still free? Reason sometimes has to give way to passion, even if it will be deeply regretted later. However, Siegel is always encouraging him: "You just have to do your best, don't waste your energy on cranky thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish this sentence Siegel used the transmission to return to the Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time he used the Elf Saint. But for the first time, trying to cross the ban on the city wall. Siegel has experimented. If he does not rely on this array, he will rely solely on his own power to open the transmission channel across the wall. The spell can only last for a few seconds, not enough for him to pass. The ban on the circumstance will interfere with the transmission and may cause Siegel to be lost in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also related to the characteristics of Siegel's transmission. The transmission of many mages is to form a beam of light, wrapped in the caster and thrown directly into the destination. Siegel opened an elemental vortex gate, connected to the destination, and then walked over. I heard that other mages have also elementized themselves and reorganized them at their destinations. These methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. The downside of the Siegel portal is that it must maintain a stable transmission channel for a period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, fifteen robbers have all died under Evan's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people tried to steal our things. They also pulled out their weapons in front of me." Evan explained while searching for the body of the deceased. He collected the money together, half of it left, and half gave it to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, you give me all the spoils as a magic weapon." Siegel said: "The next time I encounter this Things, they are handed over to Moore, he is the lord of the starting point, only he has jurisdiction in the ranks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so disciplined, very Uninteresting." Evan took a big stroke and pushed everything to Siegel. "Look, it's all for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, first summoned the earth element, cleaned the body, and then removed all the grass from the camp. , showing soft soil. Then he casts the mud as a stone spell and transforms into a hard and flat slate, so that he can portray the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smelting weapon is inseparable from fire. To create a sophisticated weapon, the blacksmith needs to master the usage of water, and the magic weapon needs to understand the power of all four elements. Siegel skipped the step of making weapons and embryos, directly portrayed the elemental array on the ground, and formed the four elements of the earth and water fire "melting furnace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a tiny magical array in the middle of the four furnaces, only the size of the fist, just enough to put down the crystal column. Siegel completed the work of carving the array on it, just to take a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim's soldiers know the rules, don't approach when the lord prepares the magic, but also help to maintain order and avoid some people, but Evan is obviously not there. This column. He hugged his arms, sideways, and watched with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't design this crystal column for making magic weapons? How can it be used?" he asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're right, it's made for the magical array of my territory. But that doesn't mean you can't use it to create magical weapons for you." Carefully check the lines of your own pattern to avoid any mistakes. "The common magical array is big and stupid, but if you understand it patiently. There are many places that are very repetitive. Everyone makes the magic array as complete as possible and spreads all the functions. It leads to the cumbersome production of the matrix. Things. I have an idea to use a spar to make a specific function using a spar to focus on this repetitive requirement. This saves time spent over and over again, and can also reduce the error rate." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan grinned: "I shouldn’t ask you, I don’t understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, this is a new method. It is still uncertain whether it is used or not." Siegel wiped the sweat and smiled and replied: "I have a new idea. I don't want to try it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand this. Just like I suddenly came up with some methods of using swords, it would be uncomfortable not to practice." Evan said: "How long do you have to prepare?" I don’t know if there are already many people watching. From the time you summoned the unearthed elements, it’s the focus of attention. Are you planning to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, not." Siegel said: "But now is not the time to care about this issue. I I will experiment with your long sword soon, and there is no guarantee that there will be no accidents. If you care about your own weapons, you should start praying now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evello Retreating back and giving Siegel a place to go, he said: "Prayers are useless. No one has ever responded to me. Even the main sacrifice of the morning church does not know what the reason is. They also gave me up. The names are called people who are not blessed by God, so they don't support me on the throne. But there is nothing to be blessed. But I haven't had any curses yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned. It turns out that Evan is like himself, and no matter how he prays, there is no result. He also asked the Elf Saints about this, but he did not get any answers. Is this related to the scorpion? After all, the biggest common denominator between myself and Evan is the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saint has mentioned "the agreement between gods" and does not know what is inside. Some gods respect the order, and some gods only look at their own moods. It is a great event that all gods will not accept prayers and enter into agreements. Siegel held the scorpion. Why did this kind of thing fall on my head? ’<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
