			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Master, pay tribute to you, I am the deep water city and the northern wilderness humble witness and singer, the singer poet Jarrell." Deeply stunned, using the etiquette of the common people to see the Grand Duke, exaggerated but elegant. "Please don't believe those rumors about me - there are too many employers who jealous of my face, plus the suspicion of inferiority, as if I was born to seduce their wife and daughter. You need to find a guide, Translators and interesting travel companions, then the best people in the New World are in front of you, ready to help you - of course, I hope you also pay enough hire price to ensure that the value is good value."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked around and found that the tavern’s villain had escaped by himself. The pub owner saw his gaze sweeping and only reported a sly smile, and the other alcoholic guests were still sitting. The location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a great place to talk about things, and you can turn a blind eye to many things." But Siegel still proposed that the poet walk with him, at least outside. The air will be much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port area in the fall is damp and cold, and the sea breeze brings a lot of water vapor, which condenses into a sticky white mist when the temperature drops at night. At this time, there are very few pedestrians on the street. Only those who have enough alcohol and courage will come out to wander. A few wild dogs swayed across the street and rummaged through the rubbish. In the dark alley next to it, Piao and Ji, who couldn’t stand it, were shaking on the wall, making an unscrupulous sorghum voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked out of the pub's door and stopped. Under the feet is a slippery mud road. Through the moonlight, he can also see some pottery pots squatting in the mud - a masterpiece of drunkards. So he let everyone wait a little while, and then turned back into the rippling moonlight. This can scare the tavern boss a lot, for fear that the "Knight" will see something uneven and want to step on it. However, Siegel only took out five silver coins and bought the shoes on the boss's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack, you put on these shoes first, I tied you with a belt, be careful not to hurt your feet again." Siegel put that soft The shoes were handed to the boy, then a string of rope was found from the pocket, and he was squatted and tied to him. Then he took off his coat and put it on Jack. The boy is very small, not even on Siegel's chest, wearing his clothes and swaying. Jack grabbed his robe with both hands and looked at Siegel's shiny breastplate, his eyes showing a complex look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet also saw the armor and looked up and down. He recognized that this is a custom of the dwarf, and it is not a boutique that ordinary craftsmen can make. This brand new armor fits perfectly with the size of its owner, so the heart is more surprising than the value. After all, Siegel is still a young man, and his appearance seems to be less than twenty years old. The body still has room for growth and exercise. The armor of the Dwarf Craftsman's custom-made armor is life-long repair, so they mainly design armor for those whose body shape has been fixed. Therefore, this breastplate for young people is even more remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you should pay more. This is the conclusion that Jarrell has drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend Janis should tell you that I need to go to the north and probably move on to the border of the orc territory, so I need guidance and People who are proficient in the Northland language. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. This is a dangerous journey, my suggestion is not to make a decision." Riel made a respectful look and bent down and replied: "From your appearance, it is not rich and expensive. I don't know if this trip can be accompanied by guards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Only you and me." Siegel replied: "So you have to carefully select the route and the foothold. Any suggestions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You This is to test me.” Jarrell stood up straight and smiled and said: “If you start at this time, I suggest you can go to the Jackdaw tribe. First, the Jackdaw tribe is relatively friendly, they produce more than looting. Merchants are also welcome to go. The second is that the harvest festival is about to arrive, they will hold a contest celebration. The surrounding tribes are also Some will go with some easy prey switching to store food for winter "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? Jackdaw tribe somewhere, "Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will take you safely, sir," replied Jarel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you are a smart person. Tell me about your requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was a sailor and he could understand the words of Jarrell. He replied: "What do I eat, what do you eat. The woman's expenses are borne by herself. In addition, one hundred gold coins can be given to you now, but someone must be guaranteed. The remaining half will come back. Pay when you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you wish, adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is specific Things were done by Janis, and Siegel returned to the house with Jack. Ms. Linda is no stranger to bringing some poor people to her home. Recently, even his son Carl, under the inspiration of the temple, began to do some specific work to help the poor, and sometimes he came to the house to take some food to help. Ms. Linda is very proud of the fact that she is surrounded by kind people. The only thing she worried about was whether Siegel’s financial resources could last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she has already thought of her idea and is going to plant some vegetables in the garden next to the stables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor child!" This is the exclamation after she saw Jack. "Come with me, wash your hands and wipe your face. I will prepare some food for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trouble you, Ms. Linda." Said with a smile. He asked Jack to rest in peace, if there is any idea to say it tomorrow morning. Then he went back to the study and looked at the records of the North for a while before going to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning he was woken up by Ms. Linda to greet the knock on the breakfast, and then smelled the smell of the pancakes downstairs. He saw that Jack had finished washing and put on a clean and tidy dress - still a piece of Carl's past clothes. The dirt on Jack's face was cleaned, although it was still full of acne, but it looked much better. Siegel looked down at his ankle and found that it had been coated with herbs and wrapped in gauze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Jack, you are much better! Come and have dinner together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast It's pancakes and sausages, served with a large cup of goat's milk. This is not enough for Siegel, so he often buys something like cooked meat in the morning. But for the skinny little Jack, this meal made him very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon finished eating, his eyes wide open, sitting in the dining chair, waiting for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Siegel noticed this, let go of the cutlery and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Siegel, are you going to the northern savage site? I heard you and the bard poet when I was at the pub."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I’ll leave in a few days." Siegel looked at him and asked, "Are you from the North? If you want to go back I can send you the words of the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am not a savage, although there is no surname, but I am from the town of Macchient in the Old World Hill Federation. Dad is a farmer, maybe he is still there.” Jack raised his head and could see the strong power from his gaze. "Mr. Siegel, the singer poet Jarrell is very dangerous. I saw his unreasonable murder in the moonlight, killing unarmed debt collectors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" I heard about this from Janis--that is the poor person you saw that night without a front door. I am ready to be mentally prepared and beware. I only need him to give it to me. Do a good job of translation, in case you need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack bit his lower lip, nodded, then said: "Mr. Siegel, I want to find My dad, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you are free now." Siegel patted his hand and said, "You are ready If you want to go back to the old mainland, you can't take a boat directly from Sham Shui Po. You may have heard about the attack on the sea. Now there is no big ship out of Hong Kong. You need to go south from the land to Ximu Town, from the southern route. Boat, wait until you return to the old continent and then find a way to go to Hill Federation. You have a long way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only have this last relative. I have never had a mother since I was a child. Later, when my father couldn’t raise me, I gave me to the dealer to be an apprentice, but then I I was sold to a slave trader. I went back like this, maybe he still wants me, I will work hard to support myself. Mr. Siegel, I know that you are a good person, I beg you to help."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
