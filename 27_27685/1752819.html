			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What effect does the combination of soil and gas bring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandstorms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a blink of an eye, the whole platform has been completely invisible, and the view is full of yellowish brown sand. The wind whipped up and the whistling sound was deafening. Everyone only hated that they could not close their nostrils and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the spell is quickly strengthened, and the tiny sand gradually condenses into a broken stone, smashing the ice wall. Siegel couldn't keep the spell focused, the ice wall shattered, and then disappeared without the traces of the wind and sand. Only the dwarf defender stood still firmly in front, his shield shining brightly in the dark brown whirlwind, like a lighthouse to bring hope to everyone behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay on!" The dwarf defenders shouted morale. His arm was numb, but the strength from the earth and the endurance endurance provided by the perseverance rune made him stand firm. The wind and the sand are not sustainable, and no one can truly appreciate the power of nature. He gradually felt that the force that collided with his hand was easing, and the speed of the surrounding whirlwind was also decreasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a huge figure appeared in the wind. The Elemental Golem suddenly appeared in front of him, hitting a pair of punches and hitting the shield on four consecutive punches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf defender may be able to withstand such a large damage in a short time, but his shield can't stand it. I saw that the thick steel tower shield slammed open and could no longer be rooted on the ground. The dwarf defender vomited blood and was kicked off the platform by the elemental golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rune of the feathers played a role, and the dwarf fluttered to the ground. The medical staff of Mora’s hurriedly rushed to catch him and infuse the healing potion to stabilize the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! Stupid big stones, let you know that it is amazing!" The sand in the exit of the giant Kerry spit, the ice-cold gun is a straight stab. The earth element demon attached a layer of flowing sand to the outside of his body, and the ice-cold gun was immediately hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of frost emerged from the sand that was hit, immediately reducing their flow rate. Kerry saw this scene and knew that the power of the ice system could restrain the activity of quicksand. So he speeded up the attack and tried to get the ice gun to touch the body of the Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refueling!" Other dwarves rushed up and divided into two groups of siege golems. They cover each other and use heavy weapons to constantly strike the enemy's body. The elemental golem itself is very strong. Now they have gathered sand and whirlwinds on their bodies as additional armor. The damage that can be done to them is even lower. The dwarves can only maintain the status quo and it is difficult to win the opponent at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel commanded the earth element rune guard to dig the platform from both directions. At the same time, it also summoned the help of the soil worms with the ability to move the earth. A lot of stones and dirt were thrown off the cliff, like a gravel of rain. In order to increase the speed, Siegel took out the reel borrowed from the Master of Idis, regardless of cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissociation is a spell that Siegel has not yet mastered, which can fundamentally disintegrate the material structure. Decompose it into a finely divided powder. This is a very powerful spell that requires the Master to have a good understanding of the composition of matter to master. However, Siegel uses a reel, he does not need to master the spell for the time being, only need to be able to maintain the smooth running of magic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of green light rises from the surface of the reel, and Siegel can feel the most simple destructive power. This kind of power makes him feel guilty, for fear that an unintentional spell will be out of control and cause a great disaster. Masters stay focused, don't go to the top of the head and continue to fight and drink, do not think that their comrades are facing life and death. He needs to concentrate, maximize concentration, and then start aiming after the spell energy is stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element rune guard suddenly stopped. After the soil in front of him was dismantled, a solid steel column was revealed. Earth elements can displace mud and rock, but there is nothing to do with metal. Siegel has a sneak peek, and a complex magical engraving can be seen from the mottled dirt. With the use of the vision, you can feel the constant flow of magical energy from the mountain to the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the powerful secret of the elemental golem." Siegel narrowed his eyes, his wand pointed, and the dissociation ray hit the steel column accurately. For a moment, the caves excavated by the earth elements began to shake, and large chunks of mud fell from the top of the head. Siegel quickly flew out of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he did not care about consumption, and forced the earth element guards to continue to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going to collapse! Everyone is ready!" Siegel flew to the platform and saw only three dwarf warriors and one priest left. Plus the giant Kerry is still fighting. They have removed an arm of the Earth Elemental Golem and interrupted its left knee. The gas elemental demon is not damaged much, and the power of lightning is brewing among its palms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of an element can be suppressed and countered. Siegel also immediately mobilized the surrounding elements of gas. Fight with the Golem. The identical lightning beam splits the surrounding elements at once and then annihilates each other in collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocham picked up the steel cannon and threw the broken runestone into the muzzle, slamming the golem and busy shooting the spell in the gap. I saw a flash of light, the wrist of the rune in the middle of the rune. With the sour teeth rubbing, the palm of the air used to apply lightning was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf shouted loudly, but the Golem did not care about the injury of the palm of his hand, and swung it with a short arm. Occam’s short life was afraid that his weapon could not withstand the attack of the Golem, and he tried to jump back and eat a bit of his body. He made a short arc in the air and was laid off the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform finally began to disintegrate at this time, and Siegel’s first tactical intention was achieved. "Hurry up and jump off the platform, don't be caught by the magic image!" The Master shouted. The melee squad immediately stepped back, grabbed the air and flew down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem also feels that he will lose his balance at his feet, and immediately rushes toward the hole. Their instructions are guardian holes, and they try to enter the hole when the platform disappears. For this reason, Siegel had long predicted that he would erect a force field wall between the platform and the entrance to prevent the image of the Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only heard two screams, the Golem hit a transparent wall of force. At this moment, Siegel once again exerted illusion and formed a picture around the Golem: he covered the hole with a blank sky illusion, and then created a false cave entrance at the end of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reversed the direction of the entire platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elements Gothic hesitated, one of them tempted to move to the hole formed by the illusion. It is too difficult to keep the illusion in the constant vibration. Elemental Golem finally saw the false scene and began to throw a punch to the force field to launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two earth element rune guards drilled out of the soil and they completely hollowed out the rock formation under the platform. Siegel flew in the air, and the tip of the wand radiated bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder Shock!" Siegel's wand forwarded, and three lightnings descended from the sky, slamming into the hole that the earth element guard climbed. Three dazzling white flames blasted out of the cave like magma erupted from the crater, and the platform made a broken sound, which broke down and shattered at the foot of the golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem made a scream of screaming, falling down, accompanied by countless huge falling rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, the combat squad that had landed was quickly pulled open to prevent the falling stone from hitting. The entire valley made a deafening roar, and a lot of dust obscured everyone's attention. Siegel was just using the spell, blowing the wind and blowing the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small push stone was topped up, and the magic figure that broke the wrists climbed out. It is all over the wound, and the body surface has been sag and broken during the fall, and there is no longer the look of the prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas element magic figure looked up and looked at the hole, and the line of sight was focused on the climbing steps. At this time, the command of the dwarf commander came from afar: "Shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trebuchet, the siege, and the weapon that the dwarf is most proud of Instantly placed on the battlefield. Even the mountains are difficult to stop the dwarf's siege weapon. Although the statue is strong, it is almost at the limit. Losing the energy of the elements that are continuously supplied, their recovery speed can not keep up with the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge demon is like a broken kite, flying out by guns and trebuchets, disintegrating in the air. The other magic figure climbed out and the dwarf launched the second, third and fourth volleys. It was slower than once and slowed down by Siegel's spells. In the cheers of everyone, it also crashed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
