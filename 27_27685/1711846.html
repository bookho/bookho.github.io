Mike pulled back the boat and cut the last cable with a knife. Siegel put the old man on the deck, then untied the ropes at the bow of the bow and unfolded the sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails carrying the hopes of everyone are white and beautiful, stretching under the encouragement of the night wind, like the flag of victory, the "beep" jitter sound. Then I heard the vice chanting and gently squeaked, then the paddle boat swayed slightly, scratching the gap on the black water and starting to move slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead raven flies back into the sky and acts as a navigator. In order to see farther and clearer, Siegel cast a dark visual spell. Unlike cities, the affairs of the sea are harder to observe under the same illumination, especially the reefs and shoals hidden under the water. The raven flies low and has been hovering around the bow until it finds a waterway that leads to the vast ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel adjusts the direction of the sail, roughly aligning the bow to the channel, and then fixing the ropes that manipulate the spinnaker. He still has no tasks to complete. The mage came to the side of the ship in three steps and took two steps to the flames of the instrumental ring. He placed it on the index finger of his left hand and sang the spell at the shipyard not far away. Three flamingos appeared between them, screaming across the boundaries between land and water and flying to the shore. Then Siegel concentrated on the flame ring and used the summoning spell again, but this time he decided to call the power of the most powerful flame element he could bear. It’s difficult to do this on the sea, but the craftsmanship designed to communicate with the elements of fire helps him stabilize this spiritual link, and the Firebird that has just been summoned also gives the wizard confidence in casting a more powerful version of the spell. The three flamingos seemed to be inductive, and turned back and hovered over the side of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white ray emerges from the void, as if the sun's rays are compressed into a single point, albeit small, but more dazzling. The white light instantly illuminates the entire side of the ship's side, and everyone on the deck covers his eyes with his hands. Many people have tears in their eyes. Siegel did not feel the slightest discomfort. I only feel that the mana is full, and the ecstasy brought by magic is getting higher. The curse sounded louder and louder, and finally it was like a roar when the waves surged, and it was like thunder echoing in the air. The white light spreads into a flame. Then the three flamingos were swallowed again and the color began to darken. From white to light gold, from orange to red, and finally dark purple to black. Not a slave or a gladiator, they were stunned by the black flame burning in the midship of the ship. Although there is no trace of heat from this group of black fires, the deepest part of their souls understands very well that anything that is not protected and close to the flames of the group. They will all be burned into shadows, and even the residue will not be left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is close to **, the black flame begins to shape, and it grows a pointed mouth, wings and a tail with five long feathers. This is a black flamingo, but Siegel’s heart suddenly realizes the name of this flamingo, which is black phoenix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all, the division ordered that Black Phoenix go straight to the shipyard. It spits out a red flame in the mouth and ignites the wooden dock, which is exactly the same as the Raven Baron. ‘Maybe this is the magical version of the big version’, and Siegel’s hands are on the side of the ship. Thinking calmly. The effect of the spell far exceeded expectations was a good thing, but it quickly calmed down Siegel, who was still in the excitement of magic. Throwing away the influence of the flame implement, the mage objectively calculated the limits of his ability to control the elements, and found that the summons were not enough to support this energy level. There are things that interfere with fate in the dark, and secretly help Siegel in various ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now more and more acknowledging this: things happening around him are not normal. This is an intuition, and even Siegel himself cannot explain it. His prayers to God have never been answered, but every time he is in danger, he wants to do things. He felt that his trajectory had already been drawn by an invisible stroke and escorted all the way. But this feeling is terrible. On the one hand, he is soberly aware of how important it is to win and survive. On the other hand, it has produced a sense of guilty for nothing. What worries him even more is that he can't imagine what the end of this stipulated route leads to. Is it a glorious victory, or a miserable failure? If he can't get the freedom of destiny, what power does he have to stop himself from slipping into a failure that may not be changed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when he put his hands together, he just finished the prayer. Macabu has changed. From the center of the city, there is a thickness of ten meters, the pink light column straight into the sky, squatting in the dark night, and then slowly spread from the top to all directions. The enchantment over the city became very unstable, and the volatility of detecting magic was more disorderly than the turbulence in the tornado, and Siegel could almost hear them yelling hysterically. It is obvious that the pink light is eroding the magical enchantment of the city and rewriting the role of the battle with its own rules. At the same time, Siegel discovered that the infernal hyphae hidden in the dock wood, like the horn of the charge, is madly proliferating, shooting numerous spores into the air. These red particles are clustered into a misty cluster that rises into the sky and adds pink light. Only in the direction of the two shipyards that were completely destroyed by Siegel, the number of spores was very small, and under the flame of the black phoenix, the vicinity of the pier was temporarily not occupied by spores. Siegel thought of the alchemy effect of the alchemists, for fear that the crew would become a living dead without ** and feelings, so he ordered the black phoenix to clear the spore clouds around the paddles as much as possible to protect the safety of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some of the resentment of the fate of the secret help, but not to accept, do not use it is even more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of intense magical volatility comes from the base of the light column, which distinguishes the characteristics of elemental spells, Necromancer spells, and spell summons. At the same time, he can also feel that the power of witchcraft is fighting against those magics, and the two are entangled with each other. But the light column persists and continues to expand its position of control. Siegel noticed that the zenith was in the middle, a pink hood was gradually forming and slowly expanding downwards as if it were to be covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells that are intensified with the purgatory are obviously not of a kind and peaceful nature, and the threat of a fear is constantly deepening. Siegel noticed that many animals jumped into the water and swam away from the city, even if they faced the constant waves. There are not only cats and dogs, but also a large number of mice, and the formation of black pressure. Some tried to climb onto the boat but the hard hull crushed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the birds that chose to leave earlier than these animals were flying birds, but the purgatory hyphae in the air made their escape action fail. After inhaling a certain number of spores, the birds lose their sense of direction, and they fall to the ground with a twist, and then walk in a weird pace toward the direction of the light column. Siegel began to wonder whether the things that caused this strange effect were really called "infernal hyphae", or was it a new technology developed by Knox? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pink color continues to expand, a breath that belongs to the opposite world gradually spreads. The first appearance is the faint gray ash in the air, which falls. A hand will turn into dust, and with undischarged heat; then it will drop dark red raindrops from the sky, and when it falls to the ground, it is found to be lava. However, in a flash, the weather changed, and the snow of the palm of the hand fell, even if it fell to the ground, it would not be damaged, and it would not melt. These abnormal creations were slowly destroyed until the purple-red acid rain was lowered in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is another volcano, there are more sulphur-smelling Yugoslavs, which is no different from Jiaoyan Hell. Siegel only wanted to leave this right and wrong quickly, so he personally sailed and tried to use every wind. At the same time, he let Jack and Mana go to the lower deck to urge the fugitives to learn to use the paddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The paddle must be started immediately, the spell vision has begun to interfere with the wind direction here, and it is too slow to use the sails." Siegel loudly toward the cabin Shouted: "There is no time, just to paddle for survival!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twenty pieces of pulp on each side of the ship, and Siegel looks at them first. Afterwards, I stretched out and slammed into the water. The boat huddled, the speed slowed down a lot, and everyone in the boat felt it. If there is no unified command, the oars will only be damaged in the collision, and will also have the opposite effect of deceleration. The mage thought of this. He finally observed the wind direction, tied the spinnaker to a fixed angle with a rope, and then left the raven on the mast and came to the cabin himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mess here, novice paddlers make a mess and blame each other, they all think it is a mistake made by others. When Mike was not good at words, Mana had no prestige among them and could not control the situation. The mage screamed: "Call shut up!" The sound of thunder oscillated back and forth in the cabin. The fugitives saw Siegel and closed their mouths. They were not willing to be caught by huge squid, and they were pulled in half like tearing paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the instructions, everyone can escape from birth." Siegel's voice is clear and bright, and is accurately transmitted to everyone's ears. He waved his wand and made an illusion of a paddler in midair to make sure everyone could see it. The illusion demonstrates the initial position of the paddle and then begins to rhythmically move the paddle to make the correct rowing position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
