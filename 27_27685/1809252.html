			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem with all firearms weapons is the need to aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lion King Alexander seized the interval of the attack, exerted heavy fog on the castle of Mire, obscured everyone's vision, and then hid himself. As the name suggests, heavy fog is a heavy fog, and every drop of water used in it is a hundred times the normal weight. Although people who are trapped in heavy fog are not crushed, it is very difficult to move their position. If you have to find a way to describe it, it is the cat that falls in the glue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barron screams loudly, summoning the power of the element through the energy lens, trying to blow the fog with the wind. However, the characteristics of heavy fog is heavy, unless it is a tornado or a hurricane, otherwise the effect is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see, no one dares to shoot. In this situation, whoever can find a solution faster will gain an advantage. No one can be more proficient in solving the dilemma than a sergeant, so Alexander's threat suddenly becomes very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion sounded constantly, and the fire and lightning were everywhere. Alexander obviously has a way to gain a vision, and others are attacked by him like a blind man. The knights also knew that they were driving down to find a place to hide. The electromagnetic gun spiders were not so smart, and they were so smashed by spells that they couldn’t break into the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barron sees the situation, and immediately surrounds Janet and Isaac with long tail feathers, then protects them with wings. Then he was hit by a spell and his body was stiff and unable to move. The lion's figure slowly appeared from the dense fog and went to Barron's face. The black flamingo can only look at him with his big eyes, there is no way to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are such a strange creature, where did Siegel find you?" The lion's sky blue eyes sparkled, revealing greed for flesh and blood. The color. The characteristics of the undead have overwhelmed his reason, and it took him more than a year to lose the style of the lion, leaving only the evil, cold and dead spirit. He walked around Baron's chest and went around behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did they go!" There was only one big hole in front of Lion King Alexander, and Janet and Isaac's figure disappeared. A soil element guard stood in the room on the next floor and waved his fist to the lion. It was this guy who got through the ceiling and let Janet have a way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander is about to cast a spell to rush. Suddenly, the threat came. A wave of magic emanates before the spell goes into action, and is captured by him. "The taste of the fire element!" He rushed to add his own flame shield, and then was swallowed up by the endless flames in his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alexander, where are you?! Get me out!" The singer of the plastics department, Simonton, floated in the air. He used the power of the flame to evaporate all the heavy fog. Relying on precise control, all fire elements react only with the water elements that make up the heavy fog, so it does not cause any damage. Simonton looked at the still-moving giant bird and he could clearly feel the powerful elements that make up the giant bird, including the taste of the elemental polymer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are distracted. You are always like this, not good!" Lion King Alexander floated like a ghost to Simon, and grabbed him. Protection spells. The Mage Master believes in his defensive spells, so he raises his hand to condense into an elemental spear. This spell can be thrown out to hurt people remotely, or used as a weapon at close range. The spear also includes the power of four elements, and it can also increase the proportion of elements in one aspect even though the controller converts the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion smiled a little and used his own strength to assimilate the protective spells of Simonton, and let these spells identify the Lion King as Simon. Do not take precautions. When the spear of the element has just been formed. Alexander grabbed the heart of Simonton, "Ha! Blood, flesh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It disguised the skin and muscles that broke outside into pieces, showing exudation The hand of the Lich in purple and black light. Simonton’s chest was blown out of a big hole, and the black gas of death spread along the wound. The fat plastic energy master didn't even have a chance to slam, and he fell from the sky and slammed into Baron's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander looked up, the spacecraft of the federation had already traveled, and the mage of the council was gradually approaching by flying. They applied various protective spells to themselves and watched the lion's actions carefully. "There is still only the guy in Simonmont full of blood. Others are still like this kind of war. The federation has made no progress so far!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic missile has the longest range. And don't have to aim, but as long as the simplest shield can be prevented. Then all kinds of magic rays rush to the Lion King, the weakness is blue, the Holy Light is bright gold, the burning is bright red, the dissociation is dark green, the anti-magic rays are gray, and the polar rays are pure white. And the rainbow of rays is mixed with the colorful light. The sky is awkward, like fireworks, and birds flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the distance, there is not much that can target the Lion. And only anti-magic rays and rainbow rays are the most threatening. Alexander avoided these rays and couldn't find Janet and Isaac. So today's raid has no meaning, so he did not hesitate to turn around and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He landed next to Baron, using the castle's exterior façade and the black flamingo that was set to block the angle of the ray, and then began to deliver. At this time, a purple ray came from behind the crack in the wall, accurately hitting Alexander's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dimensional anchor that blocks plane movements in a short period of time, including spells such as transmissions, lines, and flashes. Alexander roared and slammed the wooden wall partition with a burning hand, and Wendy, who was hurt, was sitting in the chair, and the magical light shone on her fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stopped me from letting me go, did you want to die here?" Alexander tore off the mask and turned into a lich. The dark blue soul fire floats in his empty eyes, and the cold scent of death radiates from the skeleton. Wendy broke a lot of ribs, and it hurts to sit on the chair. She saw the pressure of the mountain, her eyes showing a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You lost yourself, Lord Alexander, you are not the guardian of the entire federation during the Three Peaks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s body paused, the blue soul fire swayed, and Wendy was surprised to see that there was a hint of red in the soul fire. It stands to reason that the soul fire is a very pure single color, how can there be a second color? Red soul fires are generally from living things. The dead spirit does not have this color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King Alexander raised his hand and the power of the element gathered at his fingertips. Wendy glanced at it and smiled: "Death, do you think this spell can hurt me? The only way to win is to approach me and use my protective spells by hand. You just did this against Simonmont. Ok, is this your ability to be a teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander came without a word and grabbed Wendy’s chest. The Lich's touch has negative energy damage, not to mention that the teacher can also cast various contact spells through the palm of your hand. You should know that the Master does not have excellent melee martial arts like a warrior. He prefers to open distance, observe the situation, post-production, and long-range attacks. The spells that allow the wizard to touch the cast with both hands are mostly powerful. It is often used for a hit in a dangerous moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the Lich’s negative energy touch or contact spells, it can be effective as long as it hits the opponent, even if you touch the armor and shield. Wendy didn't raise her hand to block it, but revealed a mysterious smile and said, "Do you feel it, he came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the lich After a pause, I was about to continue to press, and suddenly I noticed that it was wrong. The early warning in the high spell warns in his soul fire that a dangerous enemy will appear soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You die before you say it!" The Lich slammed the palm of his hand and blew Wendy's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just him. The wizards of all the federations felt wrong, the space and elements around them became disordered, and the protective spells and flying techniques of many people became difficult to maintain. The Federation's magical spacecraft swings left and right in the air, and the energy provided by the secret nuclear core becomes extremely unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cloud covering the sun, but the sky suddenly darkens, and everyone’s line of sight is like a layer of black yarn. This is a spectacle caused by the overflow of the power of the shadows. It is often said that the feeling of suddenly losing color and light in front of the eyes. Everyone thought that someone had summoned a powerful creature like a giant shadow, but did not expect a huge shock wave to appear out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo smashed the barrier of the shadows and rushed out with flames and lightning. The extremely compressed element produces a recoil, and the resulting shock wave blows the wizard's mage. The direction in which the element is ejected is changed to the front. In order to avoid hitting the city of Miele, Xingsuo is decelerating. Siegel did not. He flew out of the star rope like an arrow, holding an elemental polymer javelin composed of four arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
