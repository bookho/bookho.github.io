			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Niubei tribe has always maintained a good relationship with the Mora, who has a familiar familiar with the dwarf customs: Dio. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diou’s most satisfying past is a runaway from a young age, let him come to the top of Mora, and for the first time See what concept the “state” is. Then he took advantage of his strength and joined the mercenary group and began to show his reputation. Before the Battle of the River, he was hired by Elinte and was a member of the Diamond Family Synergy. Later, because they confronted the orcs with the dwarves, elves, and humans, they formed a solid friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he came back to the bull rhino tribe with the treasure of adventure, and wanted to let his tribe develop gradually, and everyone can live a prosperous life. However, his concept has a serious conflict with the conservative thoughts of the former chieftain. In the end, he can only decide whether he or she is right or wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging the chief is an unfair battle because the chief can hold the weapon and the challenger can only barefoot. However, Dio didn't care. He won only 10 rounds and became the new leader of the Bull Rhino tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that drifting can never develop, so he gathers all the power of the tribe, and destroys other tribes around the tear lake with weapons purchased from the dwarfs. This land. Through repeated battles, the bull and rhino tribes grew stronger and stronger, and finally developed into the current scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapon armor provided by the dwarf has always been the biggest reliance of the bull rhinoceros. With the shield, it is always able to gain the upper hand in the battle. Suddenly the dwarf closed the door of Mora, and the supply broke. Although there is still a lot of inventory in the tribe, as time goes by, their strength will definitely decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to letting the tribe's men continue to practice martial arts and strengthen their body, it is also a good idea to use the opportunity to marry a daughter to win over allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata is a beautiful woman with red hair. Although she is still young, she has not fully opened yet, but no one will deny that she will be the most on the prairie. Nice woman. The man who saw her would stare at her pale gray eyes and slender neck. Slim body and slender legs, no one will notice the hidden power of her beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did your strength come from?" Dio asked the question more than once, but his daughter could not tell. Diou made this child before leaving home, but he didn't know until he returned to the bull rhinoceros. Nata’s mother died of dystocia. This is often encountered on the grasslands, and can only be blamed for bad luck. A daughter is no more than a son. The latter is a warrior and a wealth. According to the tribe's practice, Dio can not recognize this daughter. Let her continue to grow up in her aunt's house, without her need to call his father. However, because of the influence of Tiger Biel, he had a different understanding of responsibility, so he decided to raise the child personally and let her be her eldest daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man, a man who only fights to raise a girl, can not help but bring the boy's temper, fight like a boy. But Dio really never thought she could really fight like a warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natta has the ability to be called the blessing of the gods by Deo: as long as she is willing, she can break any weapon. Any shield, any armor. This gave her a great advantage in the battle, and also created her superior vision. In addition to respecting her father and taking care of her younger siblings, Nata never puts other people in her eyes, especially those who want to take advantage of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the tribal aesthetic point of view, she is too thin. The chest is not drum, and the buttocks are not big enough. This type of body can not feed the child, can not ride the horse. However, the pretty face and the fire-like hair made her a lot of pursuers, and the chief's eldest daughter and extraordinary force also added a lot of points. From her thirteen years old. There are people who ask for relatives, but she does not look at her eyes and let them "all go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several unbelieving boys trying to create a "fait accompli" and planning to rape her at night. Nata broke their skulls with their fists. It's like smashing a walnut with a hammer. Dio heard about this and thought she was doing something wrong. In order to teach her daughter the correct concept of life, he led the soldiers to destroy all the tribes of the boys, leaving only the woman to return as a sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people watching outside, and Dio is also a headache. I listened to my daughter a few days ago and agreed to marry myself by means of recruiting. He was happy for a few days, but later discovered that this was actually a big problem. After all, Diou is a chief with twelve wives. He can see the difference between a virgin and a woman. The news that her daughter agreed to marry at first was fainting, but now she has found that a kid and a daughter have become good things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will go out with all the people and Natalie separately, one by one and then hit it again, and then ask confessions, to avoid missing information - which is also Tiger Bill taught him. After concatenating things, he locked the lord of the human castle outpost: Moore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarians don’t have a serious virgin complex, but obviously have someone they like, why do they have to do something to recruit? When you say it, the water that has been poured out, the grass and the sea are all moving, and it seems that things are getting out of hand. Finally, under the hope of being a father's day and night, the men of the outpost finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio dared to appear in front of her daughter--after all, he had all the people close to Nata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata has its own room, which is also rare among the many children of Dio. She had originally placed various martial arts such as animal fur and beasts here. After returning from the outpost, it is like a private woman’s mortuary, with cushions and flowers everywhere, decorated with beautiful gauze and tassels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her younger siblings like to come here to play, especially the game of fighting with pillows. However, in the past few days, Nata has run away all her brothers and sisters, holding a mace and killing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dio walked in, she just saw that she was smashing the spike on the mace with one hand. Accompanied by the "squeaky" and "clam" sounds, the dwarf of the Mora became a hard-headed hammer with a delicate mace. There are some fragments of the ground that are smashed down from the fracture. It is impossible to bear the strength of Nata from the fracture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daughter, the guards have just reported that the outpost has arrived." Dio coughed twice and said in a serious tone: "It’s still quite majestic from the team. However, they have a total of 100 people. Do you say that they are not... Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to say that there is no guts, but Diou quickly changed his mouth. And feel that he is still very smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred people? Is he coming out with a joke?!" Nata's hands are hard, and the mace is smashed into the ends from the middle. It's like breaking a straw. "I told him. The more people come, the more timid! This bastard must have forgotten this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you like him, marry He is, why are you so troublesome?” Dio grabbed his chest and finally asked his long-standing doubts. "If he dares not to you, I will level out the outpost and catch him. I don't want to be able to escape the people who are tied up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nata smiled and then hugged her father's waist. Diou is happy, and the other side is worried about his bones. In case the daughter is not careful. It is capable of pinching people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't make a big fight, how can you pay attention to the outpost? It's a very strong tribe." Nata's beautiful smile makes Di Ou Xin was very comforted. The original daughter was for the tribe to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "What if he doesn't come? Do you marry someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If he doesn't come, it doesn't matter who I marry. But by then you must level the outpost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no problem," Dio It’s not the first time to raise your thumbs and fight for your daughter. "But what if he doesn't win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway, others can't win." Nata smiled confidently, like the sun of the sun. "Which fight do they have me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't underestimate others, there is always a powerful role in the world." Dio's brow wrinkled. My daughter is so good that she has not suffered setbacks. I blame myself for being too fond of her. Always take her around, not letting her see the vast world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to know that in addition to strength, there is speed. For those who are fast, you can suffer very badly. They will not be with your weapon. Hit, you can avoid your attack, and then look for opportunities to hurt you. The double-knife Cui He of the Shizhen tribe is such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person like this I can deal with it with patience." Nata did not agree, and the fist squeaked. "As long as I am careful and defensive, don't be impatient, they will take the lead in running out of endurance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
