			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. Presenting today's update, by the way, pull the ticket to the "Starting Point" 515 Fan Festival, each person has 8 tickets, and the voting also sends the starting currency. I beg you to support and appreciate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things will never be forgotten in life - maybe not always remember, but as long as patiently remember, it will still come to mind. Siegel remembers that Deo took the night he wandered around Mora, she was still blue eyes, and she dyed black hair. Siegel remembers that she is called Elsa, but she doesn't know if it is a real name or a pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the change of dress and appearance, Elsa could not recognize Siegel. Without the obvious features of black hair and black eyes, only the ordinary appearance of Siegel is not easy to impress. And Elsa's career decided that she would meet a lot of people, how can I remember the guests who only appeared once in the evening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman smiled and nodded at Siegel and said: "Good morning, the Cavaliers or the adventurers?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventurer. What can I do for you, madam?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you? Can you help me with the saddle? Ok, that thing is a bit heavy, I can't move myself. And the little boy in the stable doesn't know where to go, maybe he is still lazy to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking about the eggs that were stolen and taken away, Siegel thought deeply. He grabbed the saddle on the ground and lifted his hand to the horse. The red-brown horse didn't respond at all, but he only snorted and sniffed Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel bent down and fastened the buckle under the horse's belly, then adjusted the angle and position of the saddle. He looked down and saw a saddle on the ground, but he had to make a small one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was for my son, he was still small, only bought him a donkey. That I can come by myself, thank you." She walked Come over, Siegel shook his head. Since it helps, it will help the end. So he picked up another simple saddle and placed it on the back of the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am called Elsa, I don't know the names of good people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"West Geer, Xiao Ma Lin Siegel.” Siegel called himself in the name of the old captain. Just added a small word in front. “I am very happy to help you, madam.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsa puts his hand: “I am not a lady, just call my name. It’s all right. Where to go, maybe we can be on the same road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am already at my destination, and the city of Gima is in front. I am going to take a break there. By the way, I plan to find something to do next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this, Elsa’s eyes lit up and said: "From your costume and yours Politely, you are an educated adventurer, maybe a knight. Maybe I feel that you are very real. Do you want to work for me for a while? Very simple things, escorting me and my son for a while, to The town of Brugg in the east is about a week away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I still have something. I can't help you now." Geer smiled apologetically: "I won't leave for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, who are you talking to?" The sound up, citing two people turned to look at the past. Siegel only stunned at a glance: he clearly saw himself as a young man. It was a boy of about seven years old, with black short straight hair and black, smart eyes, wide shoulders and long palms. He is wearing a cotton cloth, much like wearing himself as a sailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a kind-hearted adventurer who just helped his mother and you have a saddle, thank you. Mom is asking if he can escort us. Go to the town of Brugg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy looked at Siegel with his eyes squinting, his eyes full of vigilance and suspicion. He did not thank him, but said to his mother: "You are not allowed to find a new father for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel strongly resisted a punch he. Then use blood magic to verify the impulse of the blood. Elsa apologized for her son and said that he was too excited to get up too early. The little boy ran to the horse and the donkey, and carefully checked whether the buckle of the saddle was really tied. He didn't like the stranger who came to find his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
