			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without the guidance of ethnic gods, human beings are very short-sighted, but it is also beneficial, that is, only when you see it, hear it, and touch it yourself. It is a fact. WwW.XsHuotXT.com" Evan said to the eyes of the saints: "The dwarf king mentioned that all races should work together to jointly occupy and share the resources of the earth. Distribution according to the proportion of the population. It seems to be the most suitable for us humans. But I know that it is difficult for a hundred blind people to defeat a knight with normal vision. In the current situation, I have to doubt things that I have not experienced personally. I dare not be a fact. After all, I am not a god, I am just a king, although my sword is very good, but I am not magical. I claim to be fair, benevolent, compassionate, but in these three aspects are not as good as my brother, These made me understand one thing: I must be humble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf King smiles with a slender fingertip across the soft hair, then Support the sharp point Ba: "My Majesty the King, your virtue is admirable. Since you still need time to make a decision, then we will wait patiently for a few days, what do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the recess are all on Evan? Siegel stood up and walked to the crowd. He slowly, one after another, looked at the face of the saint, and then took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wars have always been a matter of life and death, and it’s easy to be sloppy. I finally understand why the elves will fail in the New World, and the dwarves are not able to do so at Mora. Success. The decision to launch a war is not a life, it is just a creation of God. To put it bluntly, it is no different from the sergeants, the magic statues and the gods made by our mages. Although the adults of the saints have intelligence and strength, No one knows what is life and what is death. My bachelor's teacher taught me that there is great horror and great wisdom between life and death. You don't know what is horror, not wisdom. I really can't think of better. The way to lose the war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s generous statement, Evan stood by his side and agreed to nod. The current situation is very clear, and the gods have spared no effort to expand territory and faith. A crystal wall without gods, if you can increase the number of believers after the occupation, I am afraid that every god will calculate the problem. Humans have the largest army size in the world. The starry kingdom is even more important in it. Therefore, each race will want to pull the starry kingdom into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is not worried about the war. Fighting often occurs between the lords of the Starry Kingdom, not to mention the conflict between humans and orcs, sand people, wing people, and fish people on different fronts. More than one goblin as an enemy will not make Evan timid. The attitude of several major races is what most worried him. Until now, no one has told the real reason for this goblin war. They deliberately conceal the wall of the storm is the case of the storm, or always ignore it. Such an ally is worrying, so Evan can't make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He untied the sword and threw it on the table, and the bonfire made a loud noise. Clear and audible in the conference room. "I am tired, need rest, you should have a meeting!" He stood up and said: "All Saints please continue. Maybe you think that this battle can't use the mortal brain, so we made a decision for us. In this case, simply There is nothing to inform me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and left the venue, followed by the Great Lord's Sacrifice and Siegel. William is still talking and laughing with the dragon, and the rhythm of the two seems to have nothing to do with this meeting. The dwarf king looked at the sword that Evan had thrown on the table. I don't know what it meant. He turned his eyes to the dwarf saint, but saw that there was no one above the seat of the Holy One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the dwarf saint. The saints of other races have left. The people who left behind looked at each other and felt that there was nothing to say, so the scene became a little silent and embarrassing. Only the corners continued to hear the laughter of William and the dragon, and they screamed on the cheek of the Dwarf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adjourning, we all need to take a break." Dwarf Stone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed Evan to the deck, and the sea breeze from the face made them feel better. The remaining ships of the Royal Fleet saw the king appear, blew a loud horn, and swayed the flag to pay tribute to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aurora, please let us stay alone for a while?" Evan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Great Sacrifice was left, Evan asked Siegel: "Good brother. Tell me the truth. Starry kingdom and goblin, who will win?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I should leave here immediately, or not participate in this matter is better?" After Evan finished. He shook his head again and denied the idea. "From the current situation, human beings must participate in this matter anyway. I may not be able to control the development of the situation, but the evasion will obviously bring more serious consequences, that is, the possibility of losing the victory."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know." Siegel shook his head: "If you organize a battle, or develop a spell, I can still plan and move the trip, in the conference room. This kind of thing is not my specialty. Evan, I only have one suggestion, that is, you need to have the power like a dwarf, you can block the wall and end the battle. Then you can fight with confidence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requires the ability to get out of it?" Evan nodded. "It's like a sword. It's better to have an arm injury and keep your legs." But yes, can't escape, isn't it? Or is the Cavaliers responsible for the charge, and the Lord is responsible for the retreat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be almost the same. Our Master also has a saying that all Masters The last spell is Come get out "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"! Haha, I probably got an idea, "Evan sly blinked, then hands behind pacing on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the meeting was held again, Evan was already well-informed. He is no longer entangled in whether the human kingdom participates in joint operations, but constantly asks for: the weapon armor of the dwarf, the magical equipment of the elf. For other races, he asked to stop stalking the borders of the stars, otherwise it would be considered to affect the achievement of the alliance. For this, the Sha people and the fishermen, including Naga, finally began to express their dissent. They claim that humans interfere with the activities of their own race, and that they are the weak who struggle to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a dispute at the meeting. This is the scene that humans are good at handling! Like the direct intervention of the gods, you can only answer the "yes" or "death" scenes. It is simply not called the meeting. Evan smiled and watched everyone face red, then took out the position to deal with the lord's meeting, left to the right, and continued to delay the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel insisted on a day. The atmosphere could not be accepted the next day. In such a complicated situation, he could not use meditation to pass the time, so he had to perform a small range of magic exercises at the venue. After mastering the power of the four elements, he set the goal in the power of time and space. Just like the apprentices, they continually bred in the palm of their hands to practice the spell c control. He now uses a similar method to create a distorted space-time field in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much more threatening than the flames bring to others. The sharper the creature, the more horrible the power of Siegel. Can become a "king" in all races, or as a martial artist, or in magic. So every time the time and space in the hands of Siegel changed, they could feel it in the first place. The dwarf Wang Sidong touched the warhammer at the waist several times, and the Elf King's hair was cut off by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinlong looked at it all with interest, although his scales stood up for a lot of threats, but he preferred to see others A look of a glimpse. "William, is your partner deliberately balancing the deterrence of the saints in this way? It is quite convenient to use this method! Unfortunately, I can't use Longwei indiscriminately, otherwise I really want to scare them and appreciate them. The way n flows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William observed for a while. Then he said: "He is not deliberately scaring people, but is really practicing magic. Then, do you really help the dragons? If the Federation does not have a scroll of high-level spells, you can only explore it like him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Dragon snorted and snorted: "I have said it many times, no dragon will help the Masters Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about it, I will give you a thought." William persevered: "The Masters Association is not willing to give us spell information, plus the previous three-peak tower, the Federation and The relationship between the associations is very bad. The relationship between your dragons and the wizard associations is not so good. Why can't we join hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is also used. Your Master has no good things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so sure." William said: "Our Siegel's understanding is very high." You see that he has touched the edge of time and space through his own efforts. His only teacher is still learning from him. When I was in the ball, I talked about five days of classes. After that, he came out of his own way. I think that his ability to master time and space is a matter of time, even if he created a dragon curse, he is not known!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
