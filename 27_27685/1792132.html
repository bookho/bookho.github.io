			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the candlelight of the castle’s study, Siegel reads the magical information left by the predecessors while eating breakfast, trying to learn freedom or forbidden surgery—two The two complement each other, and it is possible to derive another from one body. Www*xshuotxt/com The thick pages of the book exude the taste of preservative syrup, which can cause discomfort to others, but the Master has long been accustomed to this taste. It has penetrated Siegel's skin and stained his internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet has complained about this taste, saying that she reminded her of the room used to preserve the body in the temple of the murder. She will smoke the scent of jasmine and smoke him, or let him use the pipe first. The flavor of the tobacco leaf mixed with Ningshen can also temporarily mask the taste of the antiseptic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last page of the sheepskin was rolled up and Siegel signed his name on the back cover. Before him, every union's division signed their own name. These names are based on the knowledge of the teacher to ensure the correctness of the contents of the book. Each of the mage's objections should be written down and attached to the back of the book with a scroll. In this way, future generations can fully understand the thoughts of their predecessors from various angles while reading, and draw nutrients from various ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to add to the reel behind this book, because there are more conjectures inside, and there are no actual spells and theories. For such books, the Masters have long formed a convention, only reading, admiring, and not criticizing. Because it is meaningless to criticize others' conjectures, it is possible to stifle the spark of thought and the flash of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed a long time, this is the last spell related book that can be read in the Confederate's authority. In fact, it was put into a "teacher-only book" by a careless mage with a wrong classification, but the bachelor Faranese left a sentence on the title page: "Everyone should recall their dream of being young and frivolous." So this book is preserved like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and frivolous, as if you are still young, but frivolous is gone. Siegel took the pipe and put it on his lips, just squatting but not igniting. He always thought that this was a habit that the elderly would have. I didn't expect it to be stained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return these books back, and thank you to Idis Master." Siegel looked at the "誊录魔笔" next to him, and he has finished his work. The book he had just read was completely copied, so he enlisted the servant. "Before I went to find Alfred for four hundred gold coins, I said that it was the cost of borrowing books. I gave them to Idis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem is Nod, pick up the six books on the Siegel table with both hands, and then walked out with four long legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no detailed spell of the shackles and free spells in the federation, only an introduction to the mantra. It is impossible to derive a spell by relying on the introduction. Rhett also needs to remain in a quiet detention, unless Siegel can get assistance from the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Masters Association has always adopted a very friendly attitude towards Siegel, and can say that it spares no effort to draw, one after another, a passionate, intimate letter spanning The two continents are constantly being sent to the city of Miele. Inside, I clearly said, "What do you want to do?" The Masters Association also sent a consultant to Heim through the school, and also specifically avoided the use of the title of consultant, only the word "consultant". The "God Man" named Castel Heigham - as opposed to the devil, the descendants of angels in the lineage are the gods - just in the prime of life, they squandered their bags all day in the city of Mire The outside inn lives. It is said that his ability to cast spells is not much higher than that of apprentices, and at most he will use energy missiles and mage armor. But it is said that he is knowledgeable and has a wide range of contacts. The meaning of this move is very obvious, the Castel consultant is a bridge for Siegel to communicate with the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you need to be wary of the Masters Association, there is no need to treat them as enemies. In the long history, the most energetic part is always independent. When it settles, it will be included in the association. Many emerging mage organizations that want to compete with the association—such as the former federation—are too anxious to expand their strengths, coupled with external disputes that lead to failure. But if the federation becomes like the Masters Association, the two have long merged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Federation hope that Siegel can lead them beyond the association, but this is not the area he is good at. He happens to be the representative of the emerging mage organization: that is full of energy, constantly shining new ideas, new ideas, and pushing the advancement of spell research. The Masters Association is the precipitation of knowledge and experience, and the City of Learning is the ultimate in management ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently spit out a cloud of smoke, then set the pipe aside and pick up a thin black cover book next to it. There are many names of spells inside. It is the lack of the Federation here. Not only a high-level spell that can be used by a teacher, but also many spells that cannot be found because the Three Peaks Tower was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Only if the number of mages increases, only a sufficient number of qualified personnel can copy the information.” There is a saying that makes Siegel feel very interesting, that is, the Masters Association is actually the largest transcription agency, and every wizard takes it every year. It takes several months to transcribe the various books for the association, otherwise you will not be able to borrow the materials. The Federation would like to learn from this provision. But at present, basically all the mages are busy building a spaceship, and how can they draw their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, the Federation’s spacecraft would be built to contact the Masters Association." Janet’s voice is still in his ear. Very clear and very real. "If I were you, I wouldn't tell the Federation about how to make it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinette is always wrong for the judgment of the situation. But not for spells. Siegel laughed and said nothing, just put down the glass and ended the conversation with his wife with a deep kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of the Federation’s Secret Energy is about to be completed, and Siegel will leave all subsequent construction work to them, so that they can devote their energies to the study of magic. This Peruer nuclear will be completed as scheduled, providing energy normally, so that the spacecraft can rise to the sky. But if someone recreates a secret nuclear core in full accordance with the drawings, then he is only disappointed and puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, technology and art are only one line, but the former is a craftsman and the latter is a master. When the Federation did not have the secret, it was surrounded by Siegel in a loose form. Before a large number of wizards grow up, he will have a lead time of about ten years. But now there is a secret nuclear. The federation will become tighter, his voice will be heavier and his prestige will be higher. Even in the same decade, the effect will be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Janet. He has trusted people to help him find ways to integrate resources. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to resume the correspondence between the heads of Heim’s lords, and finally someone can help Siegel deal with the backlog of aristocratic letters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the second beep, everyone’s life is gradually back on track. Another new year came, a message that made Heim shake the whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The door to the Morah's Gate is open?" Siegel just opened the letter in his hand. The Moorish messenger of the fortress crossed the underground passage as quickly as possible and reported the same news to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is to say, the dwarves begin to appear on both sides of the mountain, and they are sure to be the dwarf of Mora." Siegel asked carefully before him. The leader of the caravan, he will see the news of the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, I have let the buddy in the team climb to the top of Mora to see the situation, he will soon bring the latest news. I think The dwarves reproduce the important things of the New World for a certain period of time, so they came first." The businessman was wearing a hat and facing the Siegel with his bare head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your message, please go to Alfred to get a bounty." Siegel then called Janet. The latter is running around with Isaac in the castle to hide and seek. The little guy likes this game very much, but he can't figure out why he can always be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven Baron got the order to protect Isaac, and it flew up without sound. The little guy always forgot about its existence, and did not hide it when he was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet dragged "Play for a little while," Isaac came to Siegel’s study, panting and said: "Looking What am I in a hurry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf appears, and the door to Mora is probably open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about them?" Janet handed Isaac to the maid and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am only worried about Elinette, other dwarves..." Siegel indulged: "The dwarf is a dwarf, I am me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the dwarfs in the Elven War make you uncomfortable, but don't leave your discomfort to yourself for so long. I think you should give Eileen a close-up Letter. At least greet, it is best to invite him to Heim to be a guest. Over the past two years, the life of the dwarf is only a short time, maybe they think that the Heim collar is still the same. We will treat them as they are. We should let them see the new Heim collar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
