			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave market is located between the dock and the dock area, where you can see most of the two directions. Siegel wandered around Fitzak and spent a long time investigating the slaves captured by the pirate looters. Listening to Fazak said that the sailors who can row are very tightly sold and sold to the orc's boot camp early in the morning, where they will continue to board the pirate ship as a sailor. Most of the rest are separated by age and gender. Recently, the shipyard is very lacking in manpower, so the strong male sergeant is quickly divided. Most of the remaining women are sold to entertainment venues, while young children and the elderly are packaged for sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the slaves show up on their own, they will rotate in place for a week, so that potential customers can take a good look at the quality of the slave. But they never saw anyone with a birthmark behind their ears. This person was originally fabricated by Siegel. He only cares about intelligence and ships. There is now a fleet that has just been docked and is the transport ship of General Ullen. It is said that this general has 30 ships, of which 15 are warships, and the rest are slave ships modified by merchant ships and passenger ships. Every time he sails, he splits the fleet into two. The fastest ships are attacked like wolves, looking for the right target on the route. Merchant ships can avoid one or two wolves, but it is difficult to escape the siege. After succeeding, General Ullen will ignite the black smoke, take away the sails and water, and let the attacked ship float helplessly on the water. When the larger, slower, and heavier slave ships arrived, the people on board had no strength to resist, and they could only be put on ropes and be sold as slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Fitzak watched their unloading at the harbour, this time with more than a hundred captives, it is said that there is more to be shipped behind . The people on the shore, whether they are orcs, half-orcs, or human slaves, look at these new slaves with indifference, without any concern or sympathy. Siegel felt very sad. War is sometimes inevitable. It is understandable to capture prisoners for hard work and labor. In some societies, it is considered to be a matter of course, but people are not cattle, sheep or poultry after all, and should not be bought and sold at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking about this, and then I heard the noise. The slaves who had been shipped to the shore were not sent to the market, and the slave traders who wanted to receive were also blocked by the guards. The long team drove straight into the dock area and the door was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the rule!" A half-orc yelled: "Without the market, you can't swallow the slaves! This destroys the rules of the generals!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bowstring tremble, the shouting half-orc was pierced by a feather arrow and died on the ground. An orc on the tower in the dockyard re-raised the arrow and scanned other people. "Who still has questions?" he said loudly, no one dared to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not saying that the chambers of orcs with more than a thousand ranks monopolize the first slave trade, and all slaves must pass them before they can be distributed?" Siegel whispered Fitzak: "Even the three-eyed warlord can't grab all the money of the captains and generals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing It really did not happen." Fazak frowned, he had a bad feeling. "I will ask the leader of the Chamber of Commerce and find out what it is for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go, just meet them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to bother." Fazak looked at the distance with some impatience. "They won't want to see a stranger, and it's not good to come to the market without buying anything. If you can, you should buy at least a female slave. I will come back as soon as I finish the work."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he opened Siegel and went to a crowded place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘One eye has lost patience, and it’s time to solve this trouble. ‘Siegel showed him a big step into the crowd, thinking in his heart. After entering the grocery store, Siegel knew that this one-eyed old man might become a threat that must be dealt with. This is not because of how important he is, but simply because it is the first place where Siegel might reveal his identity. Although there is no magic, Siegel still has many ways to use it. He secretly observed the law of life of the one-eyed dad, recorded the daily business of the grocery store, secretly listened to the conversation of the guests, and figured out his interpersonal relationships. When Fitzak went out, Siegel could not track him, but he had the opportunity to prepare in the grocery store. He has always hoped that this one-eyed human being can be stupid, honestly doing his own work, and don't want to ask more. But Siegel found Fitzak very clever, with many ideas and more and more difficult to control him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to kill him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to kill him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel asks himself again, not a question of ability and ability, but a question of his own heart. Is there any other way? Siegel actually knows the answer, and there are ways. If you take the risk of using magic, he can charm Fazak's mind, or use fear to control his actions, and even read and modify his memory, which is recorded in the spells of the blood magician and the common wizard. But this risk is too great, Ma Kabu's witchcraft will definitely find traces of the use of magic, and then will send people to investigate. If found, Siegel does not feel that he has the possibility of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to giving up the plan and escaping with the tail, there are only two ways in front of him, one is simple and easy, one is full of thorns. He must make his own decisions and be as soon as possible. Because time is waiting for people, Siegel thinks, time does not wait for people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Siegel, Fazak, who was acting alone, returned to the grocery store as quickly as possible. He prepared the crossbow, poisoned the cockroach, prepared a fishing net with barbs, and made a simple trap on the stairs. He put on the chain armor and it would be better if he could wear a helmet, but he couldn't be exposed until "Sos" came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there was a knock on the door downstairs, which shocked him. He opened a corner of the curtain and looked out and found the boy who sent the letter. "A greeting from General Sakai," the boy said. This is actually a secret letter from Deepwater City, something that Fitzak has been waiting for for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent the boy with two copper plates and opened the letter with a trembling hand. The light in the room was too dark, and his dim eyes could not see clearly. Thinking of this, he went to the second floor and went to Siegel's bedroom. When he opened the door, he felt that some dust had fallen, and his eyes were itchy, but he didn't care. This is the best place in the room and the most hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven Baron has been hiding on the beam of the house, endured three days of hunger, and pretending to be dumb, no sound has ever been issued. The grocery store owner has not been able to find it. Who will pay attention to the shadow of the corner of the beam? The task of the magic pet is to fill the eyes of the wizard. When Fitzak comes in, it connects with Siegel through the resonance of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master did not put very important items in the house, only a bag of coins and toxic powder. He writes and draws at the desk every day, and most of them are practicing magic drawing. He seems to have a lot of secrets, carefully hidden, but also to hide people's eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron asks if you want to use a flame beam to open a hole in the back of Fitzak’s brain, you can directly penetrate the brain stem, and you will be able to strike the commandment cleanly. . Siegel finally made a decision and left him a life. The risk of using magic is great, but picking up your shoulders is better than using grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grocery store owner spreads the letter on the desk and unpacks the password on the letter in accordance with the agreed method. In order to prevent mistakes, he wrote the decrypted content on a small piece of paper. After reading it three times, he decided to keep it in his heart. He threw two pieces of paper into the fire and burned it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter said that the faceless person will arrive on the seventh day after the full moon, and must prepare two thousand gold coins to meet the remaining Deepwater City team. "Two thousand gold coins? Where did this time come from this huge sum?" Fazak thought of the secret under the counter, which only has about 300 gold coins, which is because the profit of this month has not been turned over. "The lord of the South took it for granted. I thought the money would come. The seventh day after the full moon, there was only one day left to collect the money? Damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He was anxiously turning around in the house, the goods in the grocery store were enough for the money, but they couldn’t sell it so quickly. He suddenly thought of Soth, this guy is not lacking in money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action is about to begin, and Fazak can't leave a dangerous molecule around him. He knew that he should report Soth to the patrol or witch festival. The three-eye warlord Lund has been strictly guarding the whole city to prevent the human mouse in Deepwater from hiding. The end of the mouse should be grilled into kebabs, and the mouse is rewarded. But Londo will want to know how he got into the city, which means interrogation, it is likely that Fazak will also be taken away to ask questions. He has a mission, and he can't leave at this time, so he only has to rely on his own means to get rid of "smugglers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms in the grocery store have five viewing holes, and Fitzak chooses one of them every night for voyeurism. He has only one eye left, but in any case, only one eye can be inserted in each observation hole. He saw "Sos" writing in the candlelight every night and then hiding under the bed; he knew that the "smuggler" was always under the pillow, and he had a long sword standing on the table and the bed. Between - where did he find the weapon, some other accomplices? He also knows that the spy puts a purse in the corner between the mattress and the bed, and even the sleeping person will not notice. Fazak did not care how much money there was, but now he is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
