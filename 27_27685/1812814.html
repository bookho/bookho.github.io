It first looked at Siegel in confusion, and then said in a very excited voice: "Congratulations, Master, you become the last winner, and you have the permanent access to all floors of the Magic Tower!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stunned. The lamp god changed his character completely in his expectation, which is no different from the person who unlocked the thinking shackles. But won? This is a bit strange. My current scores are still negative, and there are still eight other students outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, Siegel suddenly understood a bit. I have transformed the lamp god myself and completely disconnected it from other lamp gods, so in this lamp god, I am the only and ultimate winner. Can things really be as simple as that? There is still a period of time since the end of the shock of time and space, and Siegel hastened to ask the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I became a winner, if there are other students, or I am no longer the only one, what will happen? I don't want to let the whole thing fall into Loop, there is never an ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god shook his head and said with excitement: "Of course not, your right to pass is permanent, except for the magic god. Outside of the order, there will be no interference from anything. If you don't believe it, I will imprint it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes the brown arm in midair Depicted a mysterious rune, then printed on Siegel's neck. After a tingling sensation, the rune is like a tattoo and is closely integrated with him, completely independent of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel touched the tattoo with his hand and felt a unique magical wave. It is very similar to the spiritual link in the lamp god, but it is connected to the highest level of the magic tower. The ** teacher put down his heart and went on to say: "Light God, can you trouble me to repeat the rules of the Magic Academy? I am going to the tower, I am excited, I am afraid to forget something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" The lamp god did not shirk it, and began to tell with a passionate tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical school is a gift that magical powers leave to all wizards and is the ultimate place to study and study. It is the key to unlocking the secrets of the world. Introduce the Master from all time and space, let them voluntarily study and grow here. These people will eventually become believers of the magic god, spreading the power of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the creation god and the supreme god, every god needs faith. It's just a difference in the degree of dependence. The magic god is from magic, not the mage, so the influence of the Master believers is not too great. Plus everyone needs knowledge, and most people pray and believe in prophecy, so the god of magic and knowledge has always been relatively moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ley took the magical god's mind away, and the remaining fires and priests tried to change the situation. As the previous lecturer said: in their world magic and the moon. The moon corresponds to these three main gods. The mage needs to be a believer and a servant of one of the three main gods in order to gain real power. Perhaps the original intention of the creation of the School of Magic is to develop such a Master believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every believer is precious, they need to develop new magic, and continue to popularize the use of spells, so the breadth and depth of knowledge is the most important. There are many opportunities in the classroom every day to earn points, and the form is also much more lively. It can even let the magic tower open the illusion and go to various environments to practice, rather than the rigid story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of points is also varied, the most important of which is insurance. There are many things that can be done using magic spells. Shenhuo itself is hard to tell which kind of behavior is harmful. Although it is possible to re-resurreate the time backtracking with points, it will also clear all the knowledge and work done by the backtracking time. Therefore, the students here only need to deduct 30 points per day, they can get the ability to return to the room, which is equivalent to their own security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The instant return room will also be affected by the spell, not the omnipotent." The lamp god said: "But you also understand that as long as you have a momentary return to the room, As soon as the opponent comes up, the problem must be solved first, so the opponent's actions can be predicted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said that he understood. The mage is powerful by calculating the opponent's actions and arranging various countermeasures. He can use triggers on himself to deal with enemy threats, and then cooperate with the instant return to the room. You can be sure that you are safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the other eight rooms and eight students outside, he suddenly turned his head angrily and shouted at Siegel: "You actually deceived me, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be said that I saved you." Siegel was not in a hurry. Say to your lamp god: "Look carefully at the status of several other lights gods, and then tell me if they are normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown lamp god saw After a while, I finally noticed that it was wrong. Other lights gods are completely intelligent creatures. In addition to answering questions, they are blind and dumb. They can only fly slowly with their masters. Siegel's lamp god held his chin with his hand, frowning, and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only change I made to you was to cut off your connection with other light gods and avoid the spells in them that affected you. In addition, there are probably other places that have been tampered with. I can't check them one by one. Maybe you have a way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights shook his head: "This is not Within my responsibilities and abilities, no one knows what the Magic Academy looks like, so I can't quickly locate the error. But there is one thing I can do, and that is to give it to you to complete. You wait Let me see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the lamp god flew into the magic tower, all the way to the fourth floor, and then from the inside came the sound of rummaging. Siegel came to the first floor and found that it was still the appearance of copying. The four students were working hard to "work" and increase their points. He tried to go to the second floor, only to find that there was no upward staircase. I remember that when the Master of Lawom was on the second floor, the teacher summoned the spiral staircase, but how did the teacher call himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to the place where it should be the stairs, touched the tattoo on his neck and said to the wall: "I am going upstairs, going up the stairs Appeared." The tattoo did not respond, the room was also, it seems that the passage of the secret language is not as simple as imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage who was copying heard Siegel’s words and looked up at him with a puzzled look. Segal shrugged his shoulders. Made a helpless expression, in exchange for a few white eyes. Everyone's time is precious and will not be wasted on the fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the entire magic tower suddenly burst into blue light. Then, more than a dozen lightning bolts were shot from the outer wall of the fourth floor, spreading like a fishing net in all directions. Everyone didn't know what was happening, so they ran out to watch, and everyone frowned at the same time. Everyone present is a powerful mage. Very sensitive to elemental fluctuations. The power of lightning is amazing, but there is no reaction of the slightest elemental energy, and no magical fluctuations come out. It stands to reason that even if this is a illusion, there should be a magical reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome mage in a wheelchair smashed from the pocket of the space and took out a metal clockwork bird. He twisted it a few times and released the activation spell. The metal bird screamed three times, fluttering and flying, and went straight to the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome has a smug smile on his face, and he is very confident in his own creatures. This little bird is just a gadget for scouting. But it has a good speed and a strong outer casing. It can be used in the chaotic battlefield, braving the flow of information and investigating the situation, passing messages, and extending the user's senses to create an immersive feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concentrated on binding his will and the flock of birds to the lightning in the sky. But the shortening of the distance did not allow him to find out the secret of lightning. He controlled the clockwork bird to continue to rise, and when it finally touched the lightning, the eyes were shrouded in darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone clearly sees the clockwork bird as a dust, and it is blown away in the air. Its controller trembled a few times, grabbed the wheelchair armrest with two small hands and did not stumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no energy fluctuation but the power is so amazing, it is likely to be the power of the rules. It is also a legendary spell. Siegel estimates that this is a form of lightning that "disintegrates" or "annihilates" power. Unless it is also countered by legendary spells, it will inevitably turn into a fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this raging lightning, Siegel’s tawny lights flew out. Its body becomes transparent. It seems that there is no entity. The walls of the Magic Tower did not stop him, and the lightning passed through its body, as if nothing had been touched. But the legendary spell seed is so good to hide, the lamp god can still be seen after all, not completely out of this dimension, so the power of destruction still affects its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened his palm and felt his palm sink. His lamp god placed an elliptical obsidian on it, obviously only slightly larger than the nail, but it was more than ten pounds. The surface of the black stone has a dark gray pattern that can only be found by taking a closer look. Seeing this pattern, Siegel knows, and in his palm is an Iron Stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the magic items need to be worn to coordinate with their energy environment and then work. It's like wearing a hat on your head, and it's a good idea to wear a ring on your finger. Ain Stone does not need to "wear", just touch it to the forehead, it will fly, like the rope towed, around the user. He will never obstruct his view and will not hit anything. In addition to the user being squeezed by the force field effect, there is no space at all, and Ain Stone will always stay in a state of flight and provide a variety of magic effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some can absorb spell power, some can enhance strength, some can resist damage, and some can even bring vain good luck. Different kinds of Ain stones have specific shapes and colors, but I have never heard of black elliptical Ain stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wear and get it, it will allow you to get in touch with the tower, then you will understand." The light god is getting worse and worse, his chest There is already a fist-sized void inside, and it is still spreading. "Only by reconnecting with other lights and forming a network of power, I can get rid of the result of being destroyed. According to you, does that mean that I will become stupid again?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. In order to completely eradicate the spell that Lear set on the lamp god, it is necessary to let the lamp god return to the fitted state before it can start. But others will not give up their lamp gods, and the suspicions rooted in them will cause them to stop Siegel. In this case, only control others. It is only possible to get rid of them all by eliminating them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the lamp god needs to reconnect with other companions, it will not be able to get back to the "stupid" ending. Siegel slammed Ain Stone on his forehead and watched it spin slowly. The yellow-brown lamp god saw this scene. Like letting go of his heart, he turned and flew away, colliding with another lamp god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to destroy lightning is forced out of it and re-elevated into the sky to join the grid. The body of the lamp god began to heal, but the light of both eyes gradually dimmed. It only took a few seconds. He changed back to what Siegel first saw: no gods, no souls, no emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be aware of this change, and the lightning from the magic tower disappears together. Everyone looked at Iron Stone, which was spinning around Siegel, frowning and thinking about its role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stone meets the forehead, Siegel already knows the role of Ain Stone: through this stone, he is equivalent to carrying a library with him. If you want to query what you need to focus on the book name, category, author or a certain paragraph of text, the black Ain Stone will find all the related books, and select it by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The design drawings of the lamp god here." Siegel meditation in his heart. In an instant, hundreds of books appeared in the mind of Siegel, like the hail that descended from the sky. It’s full of sorrows. How do you think this, do you want to browse through the past? Siegel just moved this idea and saw the books rearranged and stacked up in their own minds. Their names and abstracts are placed at the top of the form and then ranked according to the level of relevance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top scroll is the design of the magic tower lamp god, some of the books below are the design of the ordinary lamp god, and some are the local lamp gods. Instructions for use. Siegel focused his attention on the reel and was about to read it carefully. I didn't expect all the images in my mind to disappear, whether it was a book or a scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-brown lamp that has been restored to its original state flies back to Siegel. There is no such familiar and intimate feeling. “The drawing requires four hundred points. The first use is free. Please wait a moment and it will be delivered immediately.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god spread his hands. An old scroll with a yellowish color gradually gave birth to a solid body, and finally stopped in his hand. This really is what you want, but the internal fonts are somewhat different. At the forefront of the scroll, the words "Mage Longke Transcription" are printed. It seems that this scroll is likely to appear in the transcript, but I don’t know if this mage named Longke has mastered the secret of making the lamp god in the process of copying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is your lamp god able to take things on the fourth floor? What is the use of the obsidian Ain stone he gave you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I am not very clear, you can ask your lamp god." Siegel said: "I am still inexplicable in this kind of thing! You have been living here for a long time, there has been no similar thing. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer's gaze is aimed at the direction of the lamp god. Because of the masking of the mask, it is the limit to see the movement of the eyeball. What is his expression, and what is said in his mouth is unknown. However, the exchange was very brief. The murderer was very dissatisfied with the answer of the lamp god. After glance at Siegel, he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that can be taken from the fourth floor must be good. Other mages are also asking about their own lamp gods, trying to figure out what the black Ain stone is for. The answers they get are the same: you don't know the role of the item because you don't have the qualification to go to the fourth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more such things, the more greedy people can be. The "Old Master" once fought once with the Gnome Flame Master. Although it showed good combat ability, it was not invincible, so some people began to plan in their hearts. They saw that the old wizard sent his own lamp to the fourth floor, and he saw his lamp god was hit hard. Although it is not clear how the "Old Master" does this, in this magical school, only the cost of the points can make the lamp god obey the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t come for a long time, and everyone’s points earned every day have a calculation in mind, even with the scores of the transcripts. It will not exceed two hundred. The value of Ain Stone on the fourth floor is definitely higher than this. If you add your own lamp god, the "Old Master" must have been negative. Negative points mean that you can't fight back, you can only defend. Just be able to block him. If he is not allowed to hide in the room, then he can be forced to hand over the Iron Stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also thought of this and knew that the situation he faced was very difficult. The effect of stealing time has passed, and his room is in a very slow flow of time. Once you get in, it won't come out for a few hours. He can't dare to hide. But this does not prevent him from slamming in the direction of the room, forcing those who want to block him to go in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure someone is fooled. The Gnomish Flame Master was still so impulsive, and the wings of the flames burned behind him, rushing to the front of Siegel. He also wanted to save the score, so he did not cast a spell on Siegel and chose to block it with his body. In addition to him, there is also a middle-aged human male mage who also rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped into the time-spaced area and were immediately affected. They themselves did not realize that the rules of time had changed and they were still charging as much as possible, but in the eyes of others, the two suddenly became slow. Whether it is the movement of the body or the vibration of the flame behind the gnome. Like the bugs caught in the gel, they can only move one inch and one inch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several mages thought about it, probably guessing what effect caused this situation. The power of time and space has always been the most difficult to master in all spells, but it is the most powerful. It is characterized by the fact that it is hard to prevent. If two people in a slow zone stare at Siegel, they will find that his movements become extremely rapid, and all of them fall into the eyes with flashes and afterimages. Maybe they can understand their situation and then try to leave the time and space. But it takes time to enter and leave, and the magic tower's courses don't wait for people, they can't catch up anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a lot of negative points, and a class is definitely not enough to make up for it. But he can try to apply to the teacher to go to the top of the magic tower. This way you can avoid people who are hostile to yourself. When the effect of time and space turbulence ends, the room can be used for refuge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no point, he can't hurt the slow two now, or he will be back in time. There is no need to lose Iron Stone for this matter. So Siegel did not return to the classroom. He has never put down his guard, but the power of time and space shocks is a warning to others, so no one will shoot him again this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf Anna thought about it and followed Siegel into the classroom. The outside wizard summoned some harmless white mice and threw them into the slow-moving area. They also want to figure out how this spell effect is generated, so don't waste time before the class starts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Orc Master licked his lips. Take out the staff in front of everyone. He and the god of the lamp whispered a few words, seized the opportunity of two people being trapped and difficult to fight back, and chose to start first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his staff and constantly cast spells on two people, including the elimination of defenses, the meta-anchors that prevented space from moving, and the seven or eight different types of curses. Noxious spells are never less, and spells like fireball, chain lightning, and ice storm don't have to be pity. After these spells enter the slow zone, they can only do slow motion and squeeze into a series of forward flights. I don't know if the two people inside have discovered the desperate situation they face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
