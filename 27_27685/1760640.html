			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Edith have been negotiating from the middle of the night until dawn, until the east gradually rises red, and the morning glow rises again. Master Idis decided to leave immediately and take the information of Siegel to the Masters Association. In order to avoid the attention of the Knox Association, he finally gave up the transmission array using Deepwater City, and could not even take a sea boat from Ximu Town with the Red Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves must always head east, take coastal vessels from the southern harbour, and then transfer to the transoceanic merchant ships from the sea. Use transfer when you are close to the old continent. Such a trip will take at least two months, but in order to be supported by the Masters Association, waiting is necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sent him to the south gate of the city of Mire. Although the war has ended, the door has not been opened, and the layers of debris have completely blocked the door. However, this does not constitute an obstacle for the Master. Whether it is flying or floating, Edith can easily leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf only brought two apprentices, and others remained in the "skill test field" to copy the books. When they came to the door, Siegel once again saluted and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Edith, you see the sun in the east, not exactly a symbol of many The harbinger of things beginning to change? The situation in the New World will be affected by the Masters Association from the East, and it will be turned upside down. I only hope that this change will be limited to the inside of the Master as much as possible, and not to involve too many ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox will study mind control spells, which are difficult for ordinary people to resist." Idis said: "Although your hopes are good, no matter what the spells are, always There will be casualties among the people. It is important to know that in order to prevent major changes, the Masters Association has even prepared for the sacrifice of the entire Federation. The Emperor Faranis also has this awareness before setting up the library in Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was a little confused and asked Idis: "Are the Masters Association made such a plan long ago?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, you are On the way, there is still a long way to go. In the cracks of the powers of the lords, the temples, etc., the wizard associations that seem to have powerful power must also be cautious. The association closely monitors the actions of various wizard organizations. The name of the mage is smeared. When your spell is getting stronger and stronger, the more you want to have a peaceful environment to explore the secrets of the world. For this, there must be a stable external environment. The Masters Association has already done this. The plan, but not for Knox. It is for all possible situations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and finally couldn’t help but curious about Iraq. Diss said: "How will the Masters Association deal with Knox?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf mysterious smile, "I am not very clear about this, my The task is to submit evidence and convince them. Since the sun that represents hope has risen, I should also be on the road. You have to keep the books in the library, and you will benefit from reading more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell Necromancer, Siegel took to the battlefield, finishing the inspection. The fire continued to burn for a night and until now it was gradually extinguished. The black ash and smoke rise together, and there is a scorching atmosphere everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the success of the surprise attack led by Siegel, the four weeks should be more broken. Most of the obstacles and useless siege devices were pushed into the trenches and ignited after the metal parts were removed. Many bodies are also treated in the same way. Since the coalition forces come from various lords, it is impossible to count the origins of the deceased. If not handled as soon as possible, the plague will inevitably come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People began to try to clear a path in the wreckage and use the remaining camp of the Southern Coalition to set up a shelter. The wounded who put down the weapon can get simple treatment there. A cup of hot water and some dry food can make many people survive the war. Rhett also appeared on the battlefield. The body made of rock and clay slowly moved, making many people feel scared and away. The Golem is not angry. He first came to the area where the wounded were concentrated. The people here could not escape from it, but he was treated first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Baron with his people is counting the situation of the war knight. Identify your identity based on your family's badges and other items. Which castles have lost their owners and which territories are waiting to be received, this is his biggest concern. As for the belongings piled up next to him, he only sent a few guards to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quietly looked at it for a while. Then I returned to the castle. Janet will give him a detailed account of the changes in Heim's leadership during his departure. Those knights who fought bravely should be commended, and now it is time to break the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's eyes gradually recovered, and he could start smiling from the heart. Jennifer took his hand and placed it on his belly. The little guy is restless and active, delivering a strong life force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything will be fine, don't worry and be afraid." Siegel said: "I will test the spell more carefully, and I found one. The method of stopping the spell instantly will not cause the previous accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you can catch the birth of the child." Janet said: "These days I’m hungry, my stomach is a little hungry, what time is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did’t you just send breakfast?” Siegel snorted and understood The meaning of Janet. She wants to stay in the bedroom for a while, don't worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people came side by side to the window and looked east and north. I avoided the direction of the battlefield here, so I saw a beautiful and sunny morning. They cuddle each other and enjoy the hard-won silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the scream of the servant yelling in the castle: "Monster! Monster!" Several soldiers responded quickly, towards the most lively The direction of the gathering. Is there an enemy in the city of Mire? There is a dwarf rune on the wall here, which is associated with the elemental rune matrix. If there is a magical wave, Siegel will feel something. He thought about it, slammed his thigh and said to Janet: "Bad, I forgot him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel rushed to use any door When the spell left, she disappeared from Jenny and made her cry and laugh. When the mage returned to her vision, he followed a square iron box that would walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac looked at everything around him and reached out and touched it. He began to sing another world's minor tune and looked very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Siguel Lord, everyone was relieved. A mage lord will bring some strange-shaped residents back, and most of them are already psychologically prepared. The temple built by the statue of Rhett in the city of Mire is now often visited for help. At first, I only asked for medical advice. Later, many people found that Rhett could also answer doubts and dispose of depression. Many people went to him to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two devils, here is my castle, you can choose a room to live. You are not the only constructed creature on my territory, there is also a person outside the city. The sorcerer, named Ryder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who does he believe in? Blade leader?" asked the second voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't know it himself, maybe you can inspire each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really Good news, I don't know how it feels to be faithful." The konjac stretched out and stretched, and the metal parts of the whole body made a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need to take care of it," Siegel said. "I am trying to start making a magic image. Do you want to be my experimental assistant?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two muttered his eyes, his voice trembled: "You don't want to take me off?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is no need." Siegel said: "I remember that the konjac was not made, but it was made in the mechanical plane and could not be imitated. I You only need your familiarity with the mechanical structure. After all, the maintenance equipment is your old line, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem." With a sigh of relief, I said, "Can you pay me? I only need metal, motor oil and meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage nodded and the contract was finalized. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet dressed neatly, left the bedroom and met them in the castle. As the hostess of the territory, after the war, she will begin to organize the restoration of production and reconstruction of the home. Although these should be the responsibility of Siegel, considering that the Master did not understand the situation for a long time, and there was a lot of time spent on the spell every day, she continued to shoulder this responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two tones look strange, more like a large toy, the body also exudes the smell of oil. Janet felt a little nausea and left after farewell. Unexpectedly, the konjac suddenly hid behind the mage and grabbed his robes with slender arms, which was very fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
