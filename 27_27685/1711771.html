			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day the prince’s body was found, Kerry did not train, but participated in the cremation burial ceremony and was sad with his father. Siegel and Janet also went to participate, offering their own mourning and condolences to the deceased's loved ones. Such a move has won the appreciation of many tribes, but no matter how much appreciation, the battle can not be canceled, seven days soon passed, and the days of battle trials finally arrived. Almost thirty tribes have been stalking their successors and elders to the camp of the jackdaws, making the tents more crowded. These tribes are not intimate, they have a variety of frictions between them, and some have clashes with each other. The chief of Kraft tried to mediate the contradiction between them and let them go to the battle trials of Kerry and Siegel. He would say: "Let this way become a way for tribes to resolve conflicts. May everyone live long. The tribe was able to multiply." So most people came to the scene of the battle trial and surrounded the small open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is noisy, the back wants to push forward, the previous efforts to maintain the size of the open space of the battlefield, so the middle of the people are miserable, only watching the battle The excitement supports them. Even the chieftain’s voice was suppressed, so he made a long story and shouted: “Let the battle begin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two duelists from the crowd Squeezed into the field, Siegel was still following Janet, but she was drowned by the crowd, and it took a while to run to the front. Siegel wore a breastplate, armed with a shield, carrying his own machete, and wearing easy-to-move boots at his feet. His equipment has aroused the exclamation of the spectators, and several elders can see that the equipment is from the hands of the dwarf masters, exceptionally sophisticated and precious. Outside the armor, Siegel took a gold belt and shone in the light of the noon. The dwarf language "Dragons" is engraved on the tape, but only a few leaders understand the meaning of these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is light and simple, and he is on the upper body and carrying a large bundle of spears. Standing opposite Siegel, he was like a hill made of muscles. He applied grease to his body, making the whole body look smoother and more sexy. Although he didn't wear any clothes on his upper body, he had two metal rings on his wrist with raised hemispherical cymbals and copper on his surface. Every spear is almost the same, this time there is no cloth wrapped around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people stood on both sides of the venue and checked their equipment for the last time. Siegel and Kerry came to the center of the venue in unison and said hello to each other and hugged them. Then each of them will go to the sides of the venue and wait for the battle to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the gaze of the spirit of nature, the spirit of the ancestors and the spirit of battle, if anyone disagrees with this confrontation, it can now be raised!" Shouting loudly, the one who responded to him was the "war! War! War!" and the chieftain waved his hand and announced the beginning of the contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lifts the shield and bends his body to minimize the area of ​​the enemy. Since he can't get the advantage of distance and strength anyway, then you can't make mistakes. Kerry slammed the spear over and was slid open by the shield, then he immediately slammed it quickly, and then the shield blocked the blow. Two people tempted each other, and the weapons continued to confront each other, time after time. Siegel tried to get closer and let his scimitar play its power. But Kerry continued to retreat, using the sudden side jump to maintain the advantages of his wingspan. The current situation seems to be that the short Siegel is chasing the tall Kerry. Two people are moving around in the field. No one wants to reveal flaws, so there is no hard-hitting scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turn him over, the giant, break the tortoise shell!" The audience shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither of them was agitated and was not in a hurry. They have been fighting for three days, and they have certain judgments about the martial arts of both sides: the power of Kerry and the sham of Siegel are not so good. There is another more important reason: neither wants to live or die, no one wants to kill the killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sometimes things don't develop as expected. There have been whispers in the spectators, and several young people complained: "This is the giant? Is this the one who took the black wolf princess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That is puffy?" This sentence is the most hurtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scimitar and the spear once again intersect, then separate, and the two stand in a distance of three steps. "There is no way to win the game in this way, and the audience is not happy." Siegel said: "In the end, we will all be tired of hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerryha laughed, put the spear on the ground, and said: "If you move the real thing, you will not be my opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry pinched his fist and screamed and slammed his muscles. He squatted a little, then slammed on the ground and slammed out. The audience exclaimed, as if the giants were not charging Siegel, but the onlookers themselves, they all felt fierce momentum, subconsciously sideways to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately to the right side, while avoiding. His scimitar didn't wave, just waiting for a better time to attack. The fist hits the shield and makes a loud bang, like a knock. A dent appeared on the shield, and Siegel stepped back two steps before standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd took a breath of air, then saw the scimitar across an arc and chopped to the left rib of Kerry. The Giants were not in a hurry. They blocked the strike with a steel wristband, and Mars splashed and screamed "叮". Kerry reached out and grabbed him, and was slid by Siegel; the scimitar was cut toward the ankle, but he was almost stepped on the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has both feet and the offensive is fierce, but Siegel is extremely flexible and can always block the attack and keep it on the side of the giant. Face with one hand and one foot. Their eyes are staring at their opponents, looking for the flaws of the other side - a flaw that can be won but not fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of "dangling" is endless, and the onlookers' ears begin to feel uncomfortable. The dusty field is flying, and two people are in the center of the whirlwind, performing superb martial arts. Most people breathe in gaze and watch the battle intently, for fear of missing the most crucial moment of winning. However, several senior soldiers saw the clue and found that two people were not a life and death duel. They frowned and didn't talk too much, just wondering how the battle would end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry slammed a turn and punched. His goal was not to aim at Siegel, but the shield that was constantly reflecting and dangling. He even put down the defense of the whole body and prepared for the shield. Siegel hesitated, but did not cut the scimitar to the giant's waist. As he hesitated, his shield was blown up in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was also smashed out, but just removed most of the impact. Kerry took a step and suddenly thought that there was no feeling of a knife in his body. So he stopped again and looked at Siegel in a complicated look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m so tired that I’m sweating.” Siegel put the scimitar aside and removed the remaining straps and debris from his arm. Then he took off his breastplate and handed it to the kitten standing on the sidelines. “How is the weather so hot today? It’s not the case in the last two days. Isn’t it all autumn?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This weather is a bit abnormal.” Kerry Standing still there, constantly licking his own numb fist, then said: "After the fight is over, I will pay you a shield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, In fact, I am not very good at using shields, and I take off my armor to be cool. I found that when you hit your fist, wearing armor is almost the same, so you don't waste good things." Siegel said: Speaking of good things, in fact, I still bring some pepper, you can barbecue well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking forward to it!" After that, the two rushed together again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what the giant’s wristband is made of, which can block the scimitar’s slashing many times. With the rising Venus, Siegel found that his machete began to gap, and may not be used soon. Unconsciously, Siegel began to use weapons carefully, which gradually made him at a disadvantage. Kerry kicked his foot and was in the middle of Siegel's wrist. He only felt painful. The giant stepped forward and grabbed his hand at Siegel's weapon. He had to let go and quickly roll forward, avoiding Kerry's attack from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scimitar was caught by the giant and was thrown to the kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience screamed and felt that Kerry’s victory was almost at his fingertips. If you want to talk about empty hands, how can the flexible kid be the opponent of the giant. The giants began to pursue the battle, using their feet as weapons, and constantly stepping on them. Siegel rolled over and constantly changed his position, rolling up dust on the ground. He looked very embarrassed, like a chicken that was chased and mad, but still barely supported it. Janet’s heart is all about the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Try to change this situation! ‘Siegel observes the battlefield, calculates the space to escape, and seeks help around. He slammed his foot and rolled to the bundle of spears that Kerry had threw on the ground. He picked up the spears in his hands, turned back and swept away, and picked up the body by the gap that Kerry escaped, and finally moved back to a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
