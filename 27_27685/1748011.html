			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest benefit of recent learning is to make up for the problem of Siegel's spells. Being good at elemental spells and summoning spells can't be the best mage. Only mastering the prophetic spells can have an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage is that you can hide yourself better, because you can find the danger ahead of time, and you can get the information you need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also about finding what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of locating is very versatile, as long as something that has not been deliberately concealed can be found. However, this spell also has a lot of limitations. The things to look for must be very familiar to the wizard. Earlier, Siegel felt that this spell was so amazing that he couldn't understand the principle of the spell. Later, after consulting other mages, I realized that this spell does not rely on divination to find things, but to analyze the information left around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although people can watch, listen, and sniff, taste, and touch, but there is a limit to perception, there will always be too much information missing. Positioning is actually helping the mage collect and filter the surrounding perceptual information, compare it with what you are looking for, and then get guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel portrays a circle that increases the range of positioning and allows it to act across the flowing water. Just as a hound can't cross the river to track the smell of prey, positioning without the support of the circle can't cross the flow. For the target to be searched, the wizard first tries to eat the shemale. He is still fresh in this creature, and the opponent of the first independent battle after becoming a knight is the troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their smell, image, and voice are all remembered in the mind by Siegel, as well as their ferocity, evil, and blackmail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law array is lit up, and Siegel stands in the line to concentrate on the spirit of casting spells. The information remaining in the surrounding air is mobilized to form a sinuous picture in his field of vision. There are indeed eateres here, they used to fetch water nearby. Siegel focused his attention on the direction in which the ogre left, finally capturing the most lively atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that direction, Siegel feels closer and closer to the ogre. The positioning technique tells him that there are three ogres in front of him, hidden in a hole hidden by the bushes. No wonder you can't see it from the air, Siegel thought, these guys really hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has now risen to the air. Siegel knows that he is not far from the enemy. He asked Moore to squat the horse far away, wear a good weapon and walk over. The young knight attendant followed Mana to learn a good archery skill, and Siegel did not want him to be close to the eater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is hidden underground, which makes investigation very difficult. If the wizard's magic pet chooses a mouse. It is now easy to solve this problem, but it does not mean that Siegel has no way to take this situation. He summoned a small scorpion and then cast a secret eye on it. This spell allows the wizard to observe the surrounding image through the magical eyes planted, even in a dull environment. But it can't return any sound - after all, it's just an eye, not an ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion drilled into the bushes under the orders of Siegel, looking for a gap under the ground. Then drilled in. Inside is a damp, dark, slanting passageway that is five meters deep enough to allow the eater to hide under the roots of the tree. In addition to the three ugly, horrible trolls, Siegel also saw three human men tied up by chains and squatting on big rocks. One of them has already died, leaving only a thin layer of skin on the skull and shoulders. The other two suffered a lot of abuse. Their bodies and faces were covered with bruises, and the blood that had flowed out of the broken wounds had already solidified. The knot on the wound is repeatedly torn and then grows out over time. Become a thick layer. Obviously they have been beaten a lot and have experienced many times every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is two meters high, and the trolls stand up without problems, but they are sitting and eating now. The food is a pig's hind leg, completely raw, without any treatment. They didn't dare to make a fire in the cave. Naturally, they couldn't cook the food, and they couldn't even clean the hair on the pig. But the trolls don't care much about these details, they still enjoy the taste. A plate was placed in front of the two captives, and the pig's liver and heart were bloody there. There are human tooth prints on it, and it seems that hunger has caused one of the two to start eating raw meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the former Siegel, I am afraid that there is no good way to take this situation. Narrow terrain can't unfold the elf's pace. And the ogre can not kill the hostage at any time. He had to wait until the ogre fell asleep to make it possible to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that is already a thing of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took two elemental rune guards from the space bag and cast a spell of condensed earth elements. Two element guards appeared in front of him, and the fists of the rock creaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master ordered one of them to sneak into the ground, slamming the cave of the trolls from the side, and the other descending from the sky, directly penetrating the surface of the ground. Fall to the center of the room. The heavy footsteps of the earth caused the attention of the enemies in the cave. They smashed the back legs of the pigs and picked up the machete around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls use the narrow, hairy ear holes to listen to the surrounding sounds, and use the corners of the corners of the eyes to look at the two people tied to the chain. It seems that I felt the vibration of the ground, and the prisoner shook his head and there was a tendency to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the earth elements from the underground have been drilled into the wall, and they slammed into the back of one of the trolls, and they slammed their fists and hit them. . The elemental rune guard is the size of an ordinary person, which is a little shorter than a large-sized eater, so when it crouchs on the enemy's back, it is like a child beating an adult, it is not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ordered another earth element to attack, and he opened the shrub used for camouflage and then jumped together. Before and after the pinch-on, the trolls were so busy that they couldn’t help themselves. The appearance of Siegel made him understand that he had been exposed, so he immediately lifted the machete and killed the prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ice wall divides the room, and the trolls and earth elements all go to the other side of the ice wall. The machete cut a large piece of ice on the wall, but it is not so easy to penetrate the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy under the anger turned red, and madly collided with the ice wall. Siegel shouted the command of the collection, so that the earth elements that had completed the task of attracting the attention of the enemy were re-drilled back into the soil, and they were able to break away from the battlefield with their ability to smash. Siegel does not have to make the element rune guards and enemies hard, after all, the rune core is not cheap enough to be used as consumables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two prisoners are tied to the stone, which is the best way to untie the earth element, just pull out the chain with your hand . One shoulder was next to each other and two prisoners were taken out of the hole. Siegel also left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one mind shift is needed, and the ice wall disappears. The trolls still didn't want to understand what was going on. A fireball was thrown into the hole, and the fire illumined every space inside. The trolls are tough. Even if it burned black, it still mourned and struggled to run out. So Siegel unrolled the reel and used a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound of mourning this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mor, come over, see if the enemy is dead." Siegel summoned his entourage. See how this guy deals with this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol was very careful, first grabbed a hay, ignited on the flame that had not been extinguished by the hole, and threw it into the hole for illumination. He then took out the longbow and shot an arrow on the neck of the nearest troll to make sure it didn't swindle again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll of the arrow in the neck does not move, but the other is not within the angle of Moore. He decisively pulled out the long sword, pulled out a dagger from the other hand, and then jumped into the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing a dagger, inserted in the waist rib of the body. Determining the enemy did not have any action, then he was about to take the sword and sheath, and he heard Siegel say outside the hole: "Cut the head of the trolls and burn them with fire to ensure that nothing is lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mor is doing well, and Siegel can safely check the two prisoners who were rescued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious is their unfocused eyes. The prolonged torture made the mental state of the two people very abnormal and could not correctly understand their situation. The older one is about forty years old, with a strong body and a thick scorpion on the tiger's mouth and fingers. It is definitely a pair of hands that are used to holding swords. He should have been in the prime of his life. The experience of life and the tempering of the years should give him a pair of strong and intelligent eyes. But now his eyes are dim, and the dirt and thick eyelids on his head attract a few flies. His mouth unconsciously opened and closed, and he uttered a vibrato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
