			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Kerry wants to be the king of the prairie, he has fulfilled this desire. Xiao Xiaoying said that he always wanted to conquer the deep water city. It was not simply to defeat and ransack it, but to own and manage it, and then to build Deepwater City into the jewel of the new kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before letting people learn to row and horses to cross the sea, his most ambitious dream is to become the king of the New World. In the process, he needs the strength of Heim, and he knows that his own military strength is not the opponent of Heim, and the personal interaction with Siegel is very good, so the Jackdaw tribe and Heim collar have always got along. Very harmonious. Siegel’s suggestion is to let Kerry put his gaze on the orc’s territory and use the walled mountains as a fortress to ensure the safety of his back road, using the cavalry on all sides to fight for the greatest benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of doing so are many. Keeping war with the orcs means that humans, elves, and dwarves will be willing to help, and the Jackdaws can take advantage of opportunities to grow. The nomads on the prairie have always been very aggressive, which is precisely what the merchants of the deepwater city, the mining dwarves and the elves who planted trees lacked. It is difficult for others to form constant pressure on the orcs, but there is nothing wrong with the giant Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel made such suggestions and plans, except for the orcs, all aspects are very good. But if Kerry is king, then he becomes a traitor from the knight of the starry kingdom. A country's aristocrats have arrived in another country. This kind of thing is often there, but it is called king<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Jackdaw Tribe has always been an independent place, but in his development The process of the Star Kingdom also provided a lot of help. The past supplies were transported by sea to help the jackdaw tribes survive the most difficult period of the early days. Allow him to develop rapidly after the end of the orc war. After the Elven War, the Star Kingdom also supported him to destroy the orcs. It is good to reduce the pressure on the sea routes from orc pirates. These facts are not to be erased, so Kerry has not announced the abandonment of the knights and nobility titles of the starry kingdom, and he will be the king himself, and will definitely hurt the feelings of the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said that the Emperor of Heaven is far away, and the kingdom of stars is unlikely to be too expensive to go to the ocean. When Deepwater City announced its autonomy. The Royal Navy did not block its port. Folk trade is still going on. However, if the Jackdaw Tribe attacked the hub, or the territory of the attacking Star Kingdom, even if it was just a new deepwater city, then the starry royal family would not be indulged, and the war would inevitably erupt. The jackdaws are going to play Deepwater City, and the deep-water city where the jackdaws are going to fight the kingdom of the stars is not the same concept. Plus Kerry is the king, this will never give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current cross-ocean strike is much simpler than in the past. Other lords are still unclear, but Evan understands that the trans-sea transmission array is sufficient to transport large-scale troops to the New World. The magic spacecraft is more mobile in the whole region. The simpler way is to let the Royal Marquis’s Heim take the troops and conquer the “rebels” and “invaders”, which is absolutely a matter of stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this possibility. Siegel felt that the tooth was aching. Stars against the cavalry of the sea, Heim collar against the jackdaw tribe, to play the most boring, most helpless things in the world of Kerry should not be far from this. But once the king orders, then things are irreparable, and it seems that it is not right to go or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel originally hoped that everything would be safe and safe, and that he could draw his hand to deal with the Goblin, the Masters Association and Lear, but now it seems that he is not exactly like him. willing. All kinds of troubles are coming. He took a long breath and said: "Kerry is king. This thing needs to be further determined. It is best to listen to him in person about the kingdom of the stars. And the direction of the Jackdaw tribe to send troops must be determined, not just guessing. Otherwise, it will be easy for the merchants in Sham Shui Po to take their noses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has doubts that all this is from Lear Hand, or by his push. After the Federation left Deepwater City, the past masked lords did not find it again. This is a very strange thing. They have long been accustomed to having wizards and spells to help, whether it is to operate business or domination is very convenient, but now it is obviously a problem to say that the ring is ringing. Siegel always thought that he was a warrior because he was in the federation, but he thought that these businessmen politicians who are good at playing with power, even if they are screaming on the surface, should not exclude the federation in essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they have already been associated with the Masters Association or the City of Education, but Heim’s collar has never known. If this guess is true, then Siegel can basically confirm that this is Lear's handwriting. He is planning to take up the energy in the dark, keep himself busy, and can't take it out<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, the Duke’s meaning is similar to this. Only by ensuring that this is absolutely beneficial to the royal family will it really start to work. Wiki, check out, those in Deepwater City can make the king ugly, they won’t mind The second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Evan turned his head and looked at Siegel, looking at his eyes and said: "If the Jackdaw tribe sends troops, you will How to do it"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he comes to play Heim, he will meet his own end. But there is still between the jackdaw and the Hem collar. The hub of the town, the Chirac family has always protected the safety and stability of the New World for the kingdom of stars, I think they will still do as well as ever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I really want to see what the young Visa will hear when he hears this. If he has a little brain, he should hurry to find you, instead of continuing to be unclear with the elves." Avon looks tired and begins to lose. The interest of the conversation, then said: "There are a lot of things lately, and the two of you have a lot of cooperation. The problem is still the propaganda of the doomsday spread. The damn wizard association and the school city, as well as the pointed ear elves, their proposal for the goblin has not come out yet, tell them that if I can't see the detailed plan within two weeks, then The chief culprit in the destruction of the world is that they can't let these broken mouths continue to talk nonsense to my people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Evan drank his hands. liqueur. Knock the smooth horns on the table and walk straight up. The intelligence chief nod to Siegel, copying his hand and leaving in the other direction, leaving only Siegel alone in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the window and pulled open the window with the stained glass pattern, letting the outside sun shine directly on his face. It also let the noisy voice of the stars pass into the ears. There is more and more backlog on Siegel's shoulders. He hasn't been able to go to the magic spacecraft for a new test in a few days. Fortunately, there are not many things left to do in the cloning process. Most of the work only needs to wait, but only by cloning can defeat Lear. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have never been so simple, you can't let the things in front of you become your own drag. He came to Mike and asked him to bring his own letter to the Jackdaw tribe to find the giant Kerry. It is not a good choice to have a conflict with the starry kingdom. I don’t know why the black wolf Princess Mesera did not exhort. Is it the last time that the mind-controlled thing is a simple giant with a head? Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be king, the best way is to let Kerry’s son become a king directly. Although this is an act of cloaking. But many times when you cover your ears, you can steal the bells. At least this kind of behavior is an effort. Deepwater City is a looted city whose value is far less than the orc's macabu. I hope that Kerry can listen to his advice this time and not let things get out of hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether this letter can solve the problem completely. Siegel also decided not to participate. He also has to put his energy on the confrontation with Lear, that is a race to race against time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows very well that there is only one fundamental reason for maintaining the balance of power: Lear can't find the position of the blind. Even if the scorpion is worn on Siegel's neck all day, he can't see or touch it, and predicting spells is useless. If Lear can solve this problem, it means that the final battle may start at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the initiative will be in the hands of Lear. It is up to him to decide when to start and how to do it. This initiative is too important, and Siegel cannot hand it over to Leer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on Xunzi’s own ability to hide himself, is it possible to be foolproof? Is it absolutely impossible for people to find Siegel know that this is definitely not insurance? From the perspective of spell spells, perhaps the legendary spell can solve this problem, but he still has no experience in this area. But he does know that there is one thing that can position his icosahedron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring of the writer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical gold ring discovered in the refuge with Evan was immediately put on the twentieth scorpion by the decapitation angel. Inductively, the decapitated angel immediately became hostile to Siegel and Evan. So this ring breaks through the hiding of the twentieth scorpion, and what kind of technology it uses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the writer’s technology and the technique of the goblin are inextricably The embarrassing connection, so Siegel thinks that what he learned from the goblin may solve the long-standing problem. It is very difficult to integrate knowledge across the field, but it is good to have some experience in Siegel. From the earliest fusion of the dwarf's rune technique and the wizard's magic, the elemental rune escort was created. Later, he learned the technique dominated by Ness, and created an energy focusing lens. The Elf's Elemental Surge Magical Array is still a magical spell, but there are also many genies that have unique abilities and need to be tuned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
