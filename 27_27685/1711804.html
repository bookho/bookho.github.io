			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more terrible thing than misunderstanding is that there is no way to explain misunderstandings. Siegel must not be able to show the space key in front of "Zike", which is too dangerous. What if he reports the jailer? With the help of the scorpion, the key will not be discovered, but it is difficult to prevent the jailer from cutting his stomach and rummaging from the stomach sac. If it is because of this, it is not worth it. Siegel believes that with the help of therapeutic potions, his injuries can slowly recover. He has prepared a lot of things in the space, including food, water, wine, spices, weapons and money, but no spare wand and magic kit. This is a lesson, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed very slowly in the cell, and Siegel’s injury did not heal, and he couldn’t easily try to escape. He calmed down and simulated the composition of the spell over and over again in his mind, using meditation to improve his magical skills. This is a very old method, but it is rarely used now. After the magic wand technology became popular, the mages' demand for magical materials was extremely low, which greatly saved the cost of casting, so the wizards could use the spells more frequently. The experience and experience of actually releasing a spell is much better than meditation simulation in your mind. However, meditation is still a compulsory course for the Master, and it is a tribute to the ancient tradition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is doing this meditation longer and deeper than ever before. After undergoing the process of "magic awakening", his body and spirit are ready for more powerful magical energy. In the world of meditation, the flame becomes a fireball, the water droplets become frost, the acid can be extracted from the soil, and the air contains thunder. The magical elements move, evolve, and sublimate in his imaginary world over and over again. Meditation does not immediately improve the wizard's ability to cast spells, but it can tap the potential and lay the foundation for the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a voice coming around outside the door, and Siegel’s alertness was clear. The gnome jailer carried a wooden barrel and stirred it inside with a long wooden spoon. Siegel smelled a thick scent of food, and the barrel was filled with porridge made from this grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, give me my skin." The gnome said with a foul voice: "Or don't even want to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel threw the skin bag at him, and the "Golden Potion" inside was already dumped from the window by him, and the skin was empty. The gnome guarded the two prisoners and used a long spoon to hook the skin from the gap in the railing. Before him, there was a jailer who was too close to the railing and was rushed by the violent half-orc to grab the neck and live to strangle, then torn into several pieces and dragged into the cell. Fortunately, the jailer did not bring the key, and the prisoner failed to escape. After they had eaten the body of the jailer, they were abandoned in the cell and starved to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome picked up the skin, opened his mouth and smelled it, an intoxicating expression. Then he said: "Show me your wounds, how is recovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what is better than gold syrup? Gold.” Siegel stared at the eyes of the gnome and said, “Do you want to make a fortune?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome swallowed, carefully stepped back and asked : "What is your trick? Don't want to lie to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone needs friends, friends of copper, friends of silver and friends of gold." Siegel said: "I have many friends, my friends have more friends. What do you want? The land is either inexhaustible to eat or drink, or let the strong and powerful sword customer service from your order, even if it is going to pour urine Pot? Help me, my friend will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you coming from?" The gnome said with a smile: "You don't even have clothes." Where is the gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he has responded! Siegel thought. "Yes, someone took my wallet away, and my clothes and shoes, but they didn't take away the real wealth." Siegel pointed to his head and said, "Gold is here. I remember. Tell me where we are now, I will tell you the location of the nearest gold mine, or the gem mine. Have we not left the Wall Mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is, of course, there is only one mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, dear gnome, there is always exchange for justice. You help me, I It will help you. I will explore, I know how to refine gold, I will make you rich, and will make your master rich. Listen to me, you don’t have to take risks, just send me a message. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person you think can be said to be, and will not sell you for money." Siegel continued to persuade: "You help me to convey this message. Some of the gold mines are yours. You must be optimistic about it. Don't let others snatch it. Do you understand the importance of choosing a partner? Do you need me to explain it to you in detail, gnome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be a kid!" Throw the spoon into the bucket and splash a piece of gruel. "Look at me, I have to pay the price. You are hungry today!" After that, he went away with the vat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second guardian of the gnome has been born: pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc looked at Siegel and said nothing. "Kick Kirk!" he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you remove the door? I can't, so I can only do this." Siegel said: "I don't like to play with my tongue. But who told me that my wrist was hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I suddenly thought of it.” Siegel sat up straight and looked at the half-orc: “You can't talk, you can only lick, but can you write?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, Mike."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Jack. If one day we are out of trouble, as long as you want I will teach you to write."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc stunned and replied after a long while: "哼克."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the chains on the door creaked and then spread out. The gnome jailer has a blue-purple wound on his face and his legs are limping. He untied the chain and opened the door. A guy who was two meters tall walked in and walked in and filled the cell. His body is wearing inlaid leather, and each rivet has a sturdy logo. His weapon is a blue jagged dagger, but what is really threatening is the power hidden in his strong muscles - this is a troll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you cheating my gnome?" The trolls said: "You have done what you have done, let him beat a beating. Think about it. You dare to deceive me, how will it end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to think about it, because I won't deceive you." Siegel sat upright, In the face of the threat of the world, there is no dodge. "I want freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a slave, there is no freedom." The trolls said: "You will not be free when you die."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I want to be commensurate with my value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you leave this cell, you can reach Minerals, plants or metals, you will be shocked by what a wizard can do. Siegel thought, first of all, to leave the cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls snorted and pulled out his jagged dagger, flapping his thigh and asking: "You want a bed, hot food and a woman." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also want those things, but it's not so easy to get." The trolls put a dagger with a faint blue light on Siegel's face. Sliding under his eyelids. The stinking smell is clearly transmitted from the dagger. It is a mixture of blood, bile and gastric juice. This is a peeling dagger. "I kill, and I am very proficient, so I have a bed, food and a woman. What do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger is raised high, the trolls say: "Give you the last chance, what do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel After thinking about it, he saw tyranny, suspicion and hidden greed from the eyes of the trolls. "I have a way to make you a rich man," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls licked their mouths and laughed. The gnome also attached a smile, but was kicked and rolled out three meters on the stone floor. "Don't smirk, you little bug." The trolls screamed, then turned to look at Siegel: "What do you do? You look even worse than the wild man on the wilderness, and you can't even keep your clothes." If it is not my compassion, put you in the cell near the volcanic passage, you have already frozen to death. Your life is in my hands, I can use whip, knife, soldering iron and hunger to get everything I want to know. The answer, why do you want to use bed food and women to change? Do you have any way to prove what you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
