			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the dragon are more injurious than the cold wind and the sharp edge. At least Siegel never felt that his hands were so fierce. The magic pet felt the anger in the owner's heart and screamed in the air, but then it landed quietly and stopped on the shoulder of the mage. Siegel took a deep breath and finally managed to hold his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I need to feed him with my own things? Does he eat more?" She carefully looked at Siegel with two different colored eyes. In the eyes of the Master, this kind of gaze is very familiar, just like the slave owner of Macabu, picking slaves, but it is more pure. He thought about it again, the customers who chose the goods on the market? Or a noble child who buys a pet? Maybe the latter is the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the command of the spirit of the ancestors, and you can't comment on it." Zangeville scolded: "If you are not satisfied, you can hand over the territory." Then, if you find another place, you don't need to raise him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want to steal my treasure." Capricorn lifted his right hand, slender The beautiful fingers burn a white flame, and you can feel the danger it contains from far away. "Although I rarely leave the cave, I know that it is very important to implement the ancestral command. It is not defying the dragon of this world. I still have important things not done. The reward for the ancestors is still very good for me. Important. You don't want to lie to me, I am not a fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes contain Longwei, and the power of two other dragons in the air Meet. The momentum of the three is rising. The leading dragon, Zangge Weier, consciously led this entangled momentum to Siegel, who thought that this Master could yield, but it had no effect at all. The young man standing on the wall well concealed all his emotions, leaving only the flash of wisdom revealed from his eyes. Siegel has the idea of ​​starting to plan a dragon, but he will not reveal anything before all the thoughts mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's stay." Zanggewei waved his hand and turned his neck like a lizard, and the whole body made a sound of Kabaka. "We have to hurry, we will not delay the time here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, don't wait for what Capricorn said. The two flew their arms to the sky and resumed the dragon shape in midair, rejoining the hovering team. The sky is filled with the sound of the dragon's fire, and the screaming is mixed with faint laughter. Under the gaze of everyone on the ground. The dragon's team continued to fly north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the courtyard of the Black Blood Castle, Capricorn silently stared at the Master, not knowing how to open. Siegel looked back at her quietly, hiding his fingers in his sleeves and rubbing his wand. The so-called St. Joseph is definitely a hot land, and the trouble is likely to be much higher than the income. This is the blessing of the Taikoo dragon Lonclaja? The Master figured out that the magical power that the Dragons used was the thing that really attracted him compared to the benefits brought by the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting the goal, Siegel smiled and greeted Capricorn with a gentleman who couldn’t pick the fault: "Beautiful lady, me It is the Siegel Squid, the Royal Baron of the Star Kingdom, the Federation Master. I am very glad to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it." head. After her family left, there may be no more pressure from the crowd, and the attitude of Capricorn is better. At least she put away the flames from Longwei and the nostrils. "According to the instructions of the ancestors, St. Joseph belongs to you before your death, the treasure inside... The treasure is mine, but you can show it to you... use it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since half a courtyard, Siegel nodded and replied: "I don't know what the definition of the treasure is? Is the mineral deposit in the mountain and the fruit trees outside the mountain included?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is!" Capricorn stretched her brow and said happily: "You want those things, it’s great, those are not good, you are casual. Take. Try to let go of the food in my cave." Then she carefully asked: "What do you guys usually eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat." Geer said calmly. But when I heard this, Capricorn suddenly turned his head. Hey, he’s coming over. The majesty of the dragon is not tolerated, and the strong and primitive atmosphere of the predator instantly fills the entire courtyard. Under the protection of the morning priest, most people were only shocked, but they were quickly appeased. But the soldiers in other parts of the castle were trembled and swayed. I can't stand at all. Siegel stepped back two steps and retired to a morning knight, which was supported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want to eat me!" said Capricorn, "Your teeth don't wear my scales!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is a solitary animal, and even a good dragon will consider itself first. Then decide to interact with the rest of the world. It seems that the legacy of the ancestor's dragon is important, but it does not prevent Zanggewei from misinterpreting the instructions by some means - after all, it is very difficult to let a dragon serve humanity. However, he is very clever, not using the way of excusing and confrontation, but putting Siegel into another dangerous situation - facing a dragon that cannot be thought and treated with common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get real benefits from the dragon, he must know its security boundaries, and only the rational creatures will have this line. For example, under the contract of Longzu, the life safety of the Master is not protected? To what extent can the restrictions that can be negotiated? These will have an impact on Siegel's plans. Capricorn is more like a child with a temper tantrum. It seems that she will not act according to the common sense of the general dragon. However, she can also wield a sword that no one can bear. How to control this volcano that may erupt at any time, to understand her temperament, requires the Master to constantly temper, and constantly swim on the edge of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel noticed that after the release of Longwei, Capricorn also had a hint of hesitation and regret, and there was a real alert. What is the reason for this, is she really scared? At the same time, Longwei's strength is obviously too low compared to her kind of flame that is dangerous from the bone marrow. Is there a reservation or a rat? Siegel thought in his heart, while his face was smiling, friendly and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be angry, Ms. Capricorn, please forgive my recklessness. I didn't make it clear that we humans don't eat dragons, never eat." Siegel said: "How many people can see the real dragon? Even our mage, it is difficult to deal with the dragon. Fairly speaking, I am a human being with only a hundred years of life, almost unlimited compared to the dragon. The life expectancy is very small. How can there be such a skill? And you also know that our teeth are impossible to bite through the scales, it is not designed to eat dragons at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Capricorn picked up Longwei and then bowed and said: "Sorry, I am a little rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is beyond my expectation that you can stay here. Will the lack of a dragon affect your actions in the north?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should...all right? Anyway, they have been missing me for many years, and they haven’t seen anything.” Capricorn looked around at everyone. Gently yawned and said: "You don't want to know the action of the dragon from me. You are not a dragon. I will not tell you! According to the instructions of the ancestors, the holy peak is yours, but if If you want something, you must be present. Because...because, because some things are dangerous, you will hurt the scales! Can you promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. Choosing a cooperative attitude is the most important first step in dealing with the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is happy with the appointment she came up with. In order not to give Siegel time to think about countermeasures, she quickly said: "Now give me a room to rest, don't bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not "The lord here." Siegel said: "I said nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you said no, ah." Head, casually pointed to a tower of the Black Blood Castle. Then he said: "Then listen to me, I will live there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young dragons only have the instinct to grow and plunder, as their wisdom grows Can learn to create, request and cooperate. The talent that the race gives them is really good. As long as you eat and rest, the dragon can grow fast, no second creature can do this. The sci-fi and wisdom that the super-large dragon should have embodied is magical and not reflected in the scorpion. It seems that she does not know how to deal with other creatures or even some common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common sense is a safe baseline. Can not kill people because there is common sense of murder, can not steal because there is common sense that will be disciplined. Although many common senses are meaningless to the dragons. But this is a prerequisite for their dealings with other “lower” races. This process of accumulation of common sense has made the dragon learn to be polite, especially for the good dragons (metal dragons), they are willing to communicate with other races, so this is an indispensable process. The older the good dragon, the easier it is to get along. Instead, those young tempers are hot, arrogant and irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to influence the Dragons is to modify the common sense that they have learned in their growth, which is much simpler than binding their powerful ** and magical powers. According to this line of thinking, the Masters have been pondering how to get the dragons that have not yet grown up to be educated. In history, there was a wizard who invented the spell of the dragon, which can make the proud dragon become a mount. Later, the Dragons learned to get rid of this spell and then vent their anger at the Masters Guild. In the battle that swept across the continent, the Master Tower stood still. And there are constantly special spells for dragons that have been researched. In the end, the mage considered that the short life cycle did not need to be wasted in the eternal battle. The dragons finally shook hands and thought about the terrible battle damage and the low reproduction speed. The Dragons promised never to provoke a battle against the Master Tower, and the Masters promised never to use the Dragon Trainer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
