			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dwarves can be less stubborn, able to make things clear, can... then they are not dwarves. WwW.XsHuotXT.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a reminder of Gerald Bubao, he is still unable to change the attitude of the caravan dwarf. Although the caravan was amazed at the development of Heim's collar, he showed great curiosity about those novelty and magical props, but they still thought it was just a simple business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like buying a cow with fifteen gold coins, a pound of salt for the hardware, just exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for the wrong target, I am a lord, not a businessman." Siegel answered them like this: "I have land, army and children. Min. Do you think that I will manage cattle and salt as a teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel Lord, we hope to get your permission, can In the market of Heim’s collar, the purchase of bulk commodities. As far as I know, you have included most of the commodities in the recent days... what kind of strategic materials are called, and more than a certain number of trades are prohibited, only the lords under Heim’s collar The deal can be successfully concluded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am preparing for the war." Siegel smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now peace, where is the war?" the dwarf said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, Siegel has not wanted to continue talking with him. "I am the lord of mankind, the earl of the kingdom of stars, without the obligation to serve the dwarf, the power you want cannot be obtained from me. I welcome you to visit the city of Miele, come to me to eat and drink - as long as you pay "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, we are in the Walled Mountains, your neighbor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel interrupted his words and said, "Yes, there is something that you told the management of Mora, what is the council now? I forgot. I said that I found a piece under the walled mountains. The passage can run through things. But at that time you closed the door and couldn't contact you. Although you used the forbidden character array, you never officially told us not to pass the wall mountain, so I used that passage. Now The dwarf has appeared again, and I will officially explain it to you. Given that the Walled Mountain Range is the territory occupied by the dwarves in the Tri-Covenant Covenant, Heim’s leader will hand over this passage to the dwarf and will close the passage in a few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The dwarves look at each other. They just came to buy things, and did not prepare for this, naturally do not know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heim’s collar has land and castle on the west side of the Walled Mountain Range. We will find ways to connect the two places. The Wall Mountain is yours, but if you use it again, If I run the streak space, I will regard this behavior as aggression and take a counterattack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf quickly stood up and blows his beard straight Gone with the Wind: "Are you threatening our dwarfs? Are you not afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Siegel looked up. Instantly evacuated the gas elements near the dwarf. The sound can't be transmitted, and the dwarf is caught in the suffocation. They swayed and opened their mouths, but they only spit in the tongue. When Siegel looked at it, he snapped a finger and allowed the dwarf to breathe again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell your leader, if you want to talk, send someone who can be equal, so that you can make a real threat." Siegel makes the servant Like a book with a black cover, it reads "Death Note" in dwarf language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take this book back and see. Then tell me what you decided to use to redeem people. Now disappear from my eyes, you dwarf businessmen." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel threw the booklet that recorded the Shield River’s corpse in the dwarf’s arms, then waved it and threw them outside the castle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is leaked out through "somewhere", so that the various chambers of the Heim collar are known. "Doing business with the dwarf needs to risk the annoyance of the Earl of Siegel!" Merchants whispered: "No need, no need, wait and see the situation clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Morazhi was once the largest consumer and production center in the New World, occupying a very important position in trade. Heim’s collar grabbed the title when it closed the gate and consolidated its position with the high-level creation pipeline that Peru’s nuclear power led. A large number of goods – cheap but standardized and sophisticated – are flooding the market. Merchants only need to negotiate the price in the city of Miele and wait for the day. I can ship in the rabbit ear port. The transmission array saves not only time and distance, but more valuable money than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Siegel needs to leave something to reserve, there will be no backlog. A lot of gold and silver came from the old continent, but they were useless to Siegel, but it was better to spend it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He purchased the fleet and transported farmers who were willing to come to Heim to open up the wasteland. Although energy can be obtained through the Peruvian nuclear. But after all, it can't change food and livestock. Heim’s collar encourages planting and breeding, and also buys seeds and stocks from the Old World, at a premium. This period of time was dubbed as dead and alive transport, that is, it will not be transported to the Old World, and the activities will be shipped to the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heim’s huge commercial digestive power has led to the isolation of neighboring Mora. The dwarf’s withdrawal from the foothills before the start of the Elven War also disappointed local humans. Those empty watch towers became the biggest jokes when the elves arrived. The ancient trees of war were demolished, and the residents later removed the remaining ones and used them to build their own houses. Originally they planted food, raised livestock, and brewed fine wine for the Mora. But now they all claim that the things that were originally given to the dwarves were taken away by the elves in the war. Now the hands are given by the human lord Siegel, and they are given priority to pay back the debts, so they cannot be handed over to the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard the news and knew that he had made a shield, but he could only pinch his nose and recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The actions I took during the Elven War were not fair." Siegel admitted to Janet: "Although I worked hard, I didn't The law is right and right, I can only choose one aspect. This time the dwarfs are very similar. It is too difficult to find a perfect strategy. At present, it seems that neither party can accomplish such a thing. The meeting of the stone boat is very It is necessary, but I am still worried, I don't know what the result will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, don't worry. How can there be a standard answer to this political thing? "Janet laughed and opened him and said, "Don't be impulsive, don't invest too much emotion, I don't care what other people think, I just want you to be happy and stay with me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Lord Janet, deeply kissed: "I will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire in the night In the area of ​​the plain north of Mire City, it shines like a star falling on the ground. A huge black shadow is surrounded by starlight in the middle, revealing a sly appearance. The magic ship of the Federation is under construction, and its core secret nuclear power will start running tonight. The wizard's mage went to watch, but the Siegel interface had something to deal with and did not go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the drawings, there will be no problems with the nuclear." Siegel answered the questions of the federation colleagues numerous times, they have not been able to fully believe in Sieg. They are generous, but they can’t find a reason to say that Siegel has set a trap and deliberately swindled the federation. Everyone has a expectation in their hearts, hoping that the second secret will be able to work normally - that will bring a new chapter in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took Janet to the balcony and stared at the magic boat in the distance. With the enhanced vision of magic, he can see the mage gathered together, waiting quietly and expectantly, like a child looking forward to a birthday present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they get what they want?" Janet asked Siegel's hand and leaned against his shoulder. "When they get it, will they cherish it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master did not answer, this question can only be quietly waiting for the results to surface. A spark of light from the magic ship appears, faintly brighter than the candle, and is worse than the surrounding bonfire. But that is the first light from the secret nuclear power, full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a deep breath and began to recite the spell. His voice can only be heard by Janet, and it floats out of the balcony and disappears in the cold night wind. All the gods and powerful sights are gathered on the magic ship, and no one pays attention to this balcony in the city of Mith. Janet looked at Siegel curiously. She didn't understand magic, spells, and the new body couldn't even let her feel the flow of elements, but she knew that Siegel must be doing something important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell was captured by Heim’s energy-focusing array and then mixed into the elemental energy that pervades the territory, silently into the magic The ship's secret can be in the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the stars gradually brightens and becomes more and more stable and warmer. Then, like a drowning person suddenly recovered his livelihood, violently pulled out the water in the lungs, and then gained the ability to breathe. Mire can breathe a big mouth, and the power of the elements is booming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
