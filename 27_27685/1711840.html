			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every ship captain needs to know his ship, know the ship’s load, how to arrange the warehouse, how to maintain the balance of the ship, and most importantly, know that the ship is subject to How to take care of him when you are hurt. The lucky Soss has never been attacked by pirates and has not been damaged in the storm, but he still needs to be maintained every year. Captain Marin taught Sigel how to check the damage of the keel and the ship, let him know how the workers at the dock work, whether they are lazy or slippery. "One day the ship will go old, you will command on a new ship." The old captain once said this, so he asked Siegel to study at the dock, let him remember the differences between the various ships and How were they built? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect that one day this knowledge would help me to destroy the shipyard, and Siegel smiled at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too time consuming to burn the entire dock, and it’s easy to get the enemy’s attention – who would miss the skylight? Siegel's plan is to ruin the key parts while keeping it as secret as possible. His first goal was the tool room, where all the tools needed for the work of the shipbuilders were piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of destroying shipbuilding sites, killing shipbuilders, and melting shipbuilding tools is similar. Siegel summons a fire snake and orders it to drill In the tool room, roll up all the tools and heat them with the heat of your body until the wood is burnt into coke and the metal is molten into molten iron. At the same time, he let the fire wolves bite the ropes on the dry dock shelf, pull the nails out, and wait for the shelves to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team stopped, and everyone looked at the flame animals that were raging in the shipyard with amazement. They want to leave this ruined city, but no one dares to bother the busy mage. Several slaves secretly separated from the team from places where no one noticed. They planned to find a place to hide and no longer participate in this dangerous journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who fled the team, Siegel saw it all through the eyes of the Raven, but he had no time to care about these "escapers." When he ordered the fire wolf to be destroyed, he found that one of the fire wolves gradually lost control and his command execution was slower and slower. So Siegel focused on the fire wolf and finally found the cause of its abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferno hyphae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creatures hidden in the wood still exist, they begin to grow wildly after feeling the heat around them, and countless spores climbed onto the fire wolf. Obviously, the heat from hell is very attractive to them, and it is also a big complement. Purgatory Hydra tries to control creatures from hell, making it even more crazy, more powerful and more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel feels that his spell is gradually losing control, and the fire wolf begins to stare at its owner with incandescent eyes, from full of teeth A low howling in the long mouth. "Take my spells? Think beautiful!" Siegel recited the spell that controlled the summoning, and a lightning bolt shot from the fingertips into the firebrow's eyebrows, letting the beast continue to roll on the ground. Siegel's thoughts pierced into its core over and over again, eventually overwhelming the power of purgatory mycelium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After regaining control, Siegel can check the condition of the summoned object. Hell hyphae makes the structure of the fire wolf more fragile, but strengthens the hardness of the minions and the temperature of the flame. The destructive power of the Hellfire Wolf has been improved, but I don’t know what the limits of this increase are. According to the law of summoning spells, if the summoned creatures lose control, they will first try to attack the summoner, and if they can't, they will follow the habits of the original creature. At the same time, their existence time will be greatly shortened and will soon be rejected by the world. As long as they leave these Hellfire wolves and let them catch up after losing control, then Siegel is still very safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has new ideas. He ordered the fire wolves to stay, so that they first destroyed every dock as much as possible, and the subsequent goal was to pile up long wood warehouses. There is good wood that can make the keel of the boat, and there is enough hell hyphae. Let them go crazy, this will only help Siegel's actions. Eventually, when these creatures lose control, the magic link will be broken, and even if the witch festival arrives, there is no way to track the whereabouts of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and ran to the front of the team and rushed to the next dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two docks are not far apart, and a regular army of 20 orcs is guarding there. They saw a few fires in the first dock, but did not see the firefighters. Although these flames are small, they are afraid that they will eventually become a prairie. "Send a few slaves to fight the fire, and dare to shake your head and kneel down!" said an orc captain. Then he saw dozens of unscrupulous shadows approaching his place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wielded his wand, the power of the qi element gathered in front of him, and then was violently launched.A gust of wind swelled, and all the unfixed debris was as heavy as a siege hammer. It flew into the sky, collapsed and disintegrated and then fell into pieces.The wind wall came fast, and the stop was as fast. The orc captain couldn't help himself. Although he was not hurt at all, the dozens of arrows that were shot were blown off, and none of them hit the target.He rushed to the front and was trying to see the opposite situation, only to find five feather arrows hitting their positions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two hit targets, one of which is above the captain’s thighSiegel is already very satisfied with this hit rate. After all, the archery person is not a professional warrior.Many people in the back saw the 20 orc squad, the pace slowed down, and the heart hesitated.The confidence of the battle is built step by step. Siegel understands this. This is exactly what the Cavaliers have in the battle. They set an example for the militia and build confidence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me! Kill them!" At this time, there is no elegance and temperament, only the flaming warfareThe orc’s second wave of arrows shot four slaves, but most of them followed the villagers.The first few gladiators who can fight are very fast, and they are close to the front of the orcs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the collision of metal and metal, ** and **<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of technical armor, lightning spells are always best.Electric claws also do not require casting materials, just for empty handsA wave of electric balls erupted from Siegel’s left hand, and the silver electric screech creaked, giving a faint blue glow.He rushed to the orc captain and grabbed the electric claw to his face.The orc pretend to be a flustered cross knife, but at the same time it was very embarrassing to try to cut the wizard's wrist, a cruel smile hidden in his mouth.Siegel has learned the lesson in the past, and the damaged dwarf belt has told him to end the enemy.He won't waste the spell on the first hit, it will only consume his energy too quickly.The electric claw is just a sham, the real threat is actually the warhammer from the bottom up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve unexpected results, Siegel temporarily suppressed the flame on the warhammer before the attack to avoid the opponent’s audiovisualThe dazzling electric spark made the orcs ignore other threats, and he was alarmed until the warhammer slammed between his legs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard more than one broken voice, and the shock from his hand made him excited.In Maccabu, in the days of the tears of the wilderness, what I saw and heard, so that his aversion to the orcs continued to accumulate, and now there is finally a way to vent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink!" Siegel turned and slammed the warhammer out of a horizontal arc, smashing the opponent's head.The iron helmet was smashed into a pancake, and the "fillings" inside were all squeezed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the incarcerated body and swooped to the nextAn arrow shot at him, but it was not accurate. It just flew over the cloak of Siegel.Raven Barron descended from the sky, stole the shooter’s helmet with his claws, then turned and spit out the fire beam, piercing the skullThe mage joined the squad's battle group, hitting the orc's back from behind, and the other side took the opportunity to insert the short sword into the enemy's throat.An orc warrior used his armor to block the gladiator's spear, and held the weapon with his arm. The other hand cut the face of the gladiator with a long sword.Then he rushed to SiegelObviously, he found that this young man is the leader of this team, and the flame warhammer in his hand will also be a good trophy.The orc lowers the blade and is as unobtrusive as possible.His left hand pulled the flying axe from the back belt and threw it away five steps away from Siegel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼克!" The Orc screamed, swayed the dagger, squatted on the flying axe, and flew it out.However, Siegel had already noticed that the raven on his head had been providing intelligence on the surrounding battlefield.With the help of the Orc, you can fight back faster.He screamed and used the combat skills taught by the dwarf Elint to throw the flame warhammer out.His arm is concentrated at a point, the hammer flies fast, straight and flat, and there is no rotation in the air.The orc used all his strength, grabbed the hilt and the blade with his hands, and finally caught the warhammer that flew over.However, the long sword is not designed to fight such an attack, and it is not unexpected to bend and fold under impact.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel had not stopped a trace after throwing out the warhammer. He used the skill of the elf's pace to accelerate, followed by the enemy.He left his hand between the arms of the orc, and pressed it on the iron armor.The magical cockroach blasts on the metal armor, penetrates the hair, skin, internal organs, and reaches the bone marrow.The inside of the orc's body seems to be illuminated by a torch, and a scorching smell is accompanied by blue smoke falling out of the gap of the armor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand grasped the burning warhammer on the sword, and made a short effort to accurately hit the nose of the orc, two consecutive times, to completely solve this enemy.After all, the team of the fugitives has the advantage of the number of people. It is hard to be an opponent of the orcs, but they can often besiege an enemy by two or three people.An orc soldier saw the situation, and turned and began to run away.Siegel had no time to find the longbow, but also for the sake of stability, aiming at the orc deserter using the energy missile method.With his curse, three purple energy balls traverse the space of the battlefield, accurately hit the enemy's back, and then explodeThe orc glides on the ground for a distance, and then can’t move at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
