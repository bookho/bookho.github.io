			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Janet escaped the fate of death and strengthened the power of the blood of the demon with the potion. Under the care of Siegel, she only stabilized with a daytime, her body returned to normal temperature, and she had already had enough energy to eat. Siegel studied Evan's appearance, stewed a pot of broth in a jar, with barley, radish and onions, a few boiled corned beef, and a squirrel. The demon Raven was sent out to hunt early, and a bunch of flame rays penetrated the squirrel's head accurately and then came back. The meat on the squirrel was completely preserved, and after being peeled, it was thrown into a jar and stewed. After a while, a strong aroma was floated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuts and pine nuts stored in the squirrel hole became the spoils of the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven who can spit fire, this is already anecdote? Siegel thought, and immediately remembered when the magic awakened. It is a feeling of excitement and refreshment, indescribable, and only in the sense of embracing Janet can be compared. Adding new firewood to the fire, letting the flames drive away the cold, and then watching the beloved woman gradually get better, this is the most leisurely and happy moment of this adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the camp, the wind was blowing strongly and the snow on the ground was scraped again. His Royal Highness and the nobles set off first and took all the combatants. More than a dozen attendants were left to deal with the final work in the cold wind: the ropes of the tents were frozen and stiff, and there were a few donkeys who were unwilling to hurry in the snow, and what to do if they could not catch up with the first troops. This is what the followers need to worry about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel helps Janet move slowly in the snow, walking in the middle of the team, here is the safest place, it is better to go . The front team will pass the blood flat and easy to pass, and it has not been passed by too many people, not too muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew a snoring, weak and distant, and could not tell what animal it was. At this time, the wolves should not have a hole for food, and the sound will not be so crisp. With the sound of the snow and the whistling sound, this strange cry rises and falls, like a sly and lonely song, which makes people stand upright. Siegel sent the magic pet out, but the wind affected the flight ability of the raven, and it quickly flew back. The black eyes were not found in the air, and the entire walled mountain range looked extremely desolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what it is, I hope I won't attack the team." Siegel bites Janet's ear so his whispers won't be The wind blows away. "General beasts will avoid the pedestrians who make up the team, but if it is an orc, I will hide you in the spell, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can change The orc looks like a fool." Janet clutched Siegel's arm and handed a kiss. "You are the ones who need to pay attention to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cuddle each other and quietly say warm words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team walks very slowly, and still walks on the mountain road for half a day. The strange sounds in the wind not only came from the front, but now faintly drifted to the back direction. Some mercenaries say that the snowman in the walled mountains is groaning, they can make avalanches. However, there is no heavy snow on the side of the city wall, and the possibility of an avalanche is very small, so the mercenary changed his mouth and said it was a landslide. Everyone knows that this is just a story of scaring children, but it has raised vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no rest at noon, there is no place to rest on the narrow mountain road, and it is impossible to cook. The same is true of the nobility. There is no time and space to open the basket, and there is no way to provide hot food. Everyone just put the dried meat and hard noodles in their mouths and waited for the warmth to eat slowly. As Siegel walks, he uses magic to heat the wine cellar, allowing himself and Janet to have a warm drink. The travel companion next to him saw this scene, and he was very polite to ask Siegel for help. When everyone came to level the ridge, people in the middle of the team could drink hot alcohol, and the body warmed up and walked stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the team stopped at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 30 cavalry blocks the team, they just stopped at the level of the ridge exit. If you continue to move forward from here, one is the road down the mountain and the other is the castle leading to the Black Blood. The other party intentionally ambushed here and picked the only terrain that allowed the cavalry to charge. The cavalry were armed with rifles and machete, but with a sling in their hands, covering everyone in the range. Sir Bill stood in front of the team. He narrowed his eyes and searched carefully. He found that there were hidden infantry and shooters on the ridges on both sides. These people are obviously directed at the prince's temple, and their intentions are not. But at this time there is only one morning guard, and I don’t know how long his protection can last. If the prince's Highness did not lose the Master and the Morning Guard in the unintentional expedition, these slings and rifles would not pose a real threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enthusiasm of the Schlint family really touched us, but His Royal Highness has his own itinerary, and the Black Blood Castle is not there." Count Todd endured his anger and stared at the rider and said: "As for the orcs, a little bit of miscellaneous threatens us. You will let the road open soon, and the team will continue to go down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country Todd, if the prince of the prince was attacked by the orcs here, our family is also difficult It’s a slogan. It’s better to solve this trouble directly than at that time. So, please go to the Black Blood Castle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If we don’t Going?” Count Todd’s hand had been put on the hilt, and the parrot’s long sword slowly pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, we can't let His Royal Highness and you fall into the hands of the orcs, which will have a serious impact on the strategy of the entire city wall. Use or use I will take you back to the Black Blood Castle." The little lord showed a smile on his face, and said with a fearlessness: "Count, Todd, do you think these people can block the cavalry? Many of them are actually willing to go to the Black Blood Castle." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, several mercenaries suddenly pulled out the sword, stabbed to the companions around. Several people were caught off guard, and even the screams did not come out and fell into a pool of blood, and the scene became very chaotic. Someone rushed to Siegel, but he caught the wrist of the sword, and then it was a twist. Siegel took his weapon and then stabbed him into his heart with a wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several successful soldiers quickly retreated and left the center of chaos. Siegel stunned and suddenly understood the purpose of the enemy. He stumbled Janet and stuffed it under the brakes. At this moment, the arrow hits, and the shooters hidden on the ridge begin to stand up. Siegel tried to dodge, but was still shot on the right shoulder. The blood didn't flow much, but the muscles were damaged and I couldn't hold the sword for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid, don't shoot the aristocrats, but also keep your life and demand a ransom!" The little lord shouted: "The average mercenary does not matter how much he dies!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles have drawn out their weapons, but the three riders fired at their feet, while others did not send them and continued to aim at deterrence. Earl Todd shouted: "For the honor of the royal family, it is time for you to honor the oath!" He took the sword and took the lead, and Sir Bill followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 弩 扫 扫 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , After the riders took a shot, they immediately took out the machete and began to charge. They are also afraid that the death of the nobility will violate the orders of the young lords, so the machete is only to block the other's weapons, the horses are only seeking to knock down, never step on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles had no advantage in front of the cavalry. Several guys who tried to get on the battle were taken care of by the arrows. The mounts were quickly shot and re-emerged into infantry. . The team was washed away, and the enemy's sword and shield warriors also came down from the ridge and joined the encirclement. The situation on the court has become very unfavorable. The other side has more than three times more princes, and they have a tacit understanding and action. These are the elite soldiers who have fought with the orcs. They have gone through many battlefields and have already experienced the test of blood and fire. Many of the prince's accompanying aristocrats have only had experience in the battlefield and the arena. The battlefield is completely at the level of the mind, and basically can't help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Immediately let go of the weapon, or I will order to shoot freely." The young lord did not charge, facing the count of Count Todd. The old count waved his long sword and tried to rush to hold the little lord to change the situation on the field. But the three black guards of the Lesser Lord have been in front of the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rebellious mercenary holding an axe, mad at the stimulation of blood donation, screaming and screaming. Janet throws a dagger and is in the middle of the door. Siegel looked at the form. His right shoulder was injured and he couldn't use his weapon. It was too difficult to kill. He put away his wand and took a reel from the bag behind his back. This is an invisible scroll he bought in Deepwater City, which can make a person disappear completely in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left this spell to Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hide it, don't get caught." Siegel unrolls the scroll and guides the power of magic. His actions caught the attention of the enemy, and a sword-filled infantry rushed up to kill Siegel. A mercenary who had just drunk the overheated wine jumped over and blocked the enemy for Segal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is about to succeed, but a smashing arrow hits the breastplate and pierces Siegel's abdomen. If there is no armor, 弩矢 will not only puncture less than three centimeters. Although Siegel tried to control it, the spell still lost its goal and failed to make Janet invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
