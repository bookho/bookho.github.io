			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time since I didn’t use the spell of blood imitation. I used this spell to deceive the blood trap a long time ago, even specializing in bloody secrets. The blood magician has been deceived and should be able to make the druid here dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this spell has its drawbacks, that is, Siegel does not know what kind of blood is being imitated. However, he soon stopped worrying about this problem, because in addition to the elf druid's defense, other ethnic spells began to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roots of the trees, you can see some stones buried in the soil with a little care. Moss, deciduous and roots form a natural cover that obscures the dwarf runes on the surface of the stone. If you don't have a deep research on runes, I'm afraid it's hard to notice the power of spells spreading in the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of rune is this?" Siegel squatted under a big tree, gently smashing the stone across the buckskin gloves. . The runestone in front of me has experienced at least six hundred years of wind and rain, and in addition to the part of the rune engraved, the damage has been severe elsewhere. However, the power of the dwarf still makes it bite the earth tightly. Even the trees that are drilled from the side can't be overturned. It can only be like two wrestlers, and they will fight forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The runestone itself is not complicated, although it is a rare old dwarf, but only a few characters. "Listening, rhythm, earth, vibration", if connected in series, its function is easy to deduce: this is a rune matrix that detects land vibrations, if you want to go underground, it will be triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some burrowing animals do not affect the nesting behavior too much, but the idea of ​​using earth elements to guard the way to open the road is not feasible. The elves have laid out the defense lines on the ground, and the dwarves are laid underground? Siegel grinned and was about to get up and leave, but found that there was a word below Runestone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, more than half of the stone is buried in the soil, and there should be words in the dirt. He gently poked the soil like a groundhog digs a cave. After removing the upper layer of mulch with a thickness of about three fingers. The ground beneath it became impossible to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage or fine gold items can be riddled naturally, but that will almost certainly touch the detection magic. Judging from the more than a dozen characters that are revealed again, the dwarf runestone will also detect the steps on the ground to infer what is going on. Different species have different paces. The wise hunter can lie on the ground to judge the prey, which is the application of this truth. In other words, it is not enough to have the smell of animals (blood veins). Do you need to follow the same footwork mode? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of a hassle, after all, Siegel does not have the knowledge and skills in this area. Druids through long-term observation and imitation. It is possible to reproduce the animal's posture flawlessly when it is transformed, but the transformation of the mage can only be shaped like it, and there is no expressiveness in life habits. If you don't want to touch the trap of the pace of detection, then you can only move in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel did this, carefully not touching the ground and plants, but soon he found that this approach was not feasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees in the forest became denser and the sunlight was barely visible from the branches and leaves, and a faint smog began to appear around them. It is like a tulle and a ghost, slowly and gently moving through the woods, but such beauty is hidden in danger. Siegel saw a faint trace of elemental magic. Obviously the style of the human mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of this mist is very clever, and there is no formed array of them, which means that the magic of display will not show magical light. The whole battle is a semi-finished product, and many of the broken and broken spell structures float in the air. But they are very fragmented and can be reassembled into complete spells once they encounter the appropriate spell structure or elemental fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a jigsaw puzzle, with a piece of debris waiting for other pieces to come up. Siegel found that the spells targeted include flight, floating, floating, flash, arbitrary, and deformation. Once these spells exist, the mist can be felt and the warning signal sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very clever way." Siegel stopped and stood in the ground to think about countermeasures. The mage who sets this spell is slightly weaker than Siegel in element manipulation, so there is no chance. Siegel can bring a breeze from afar and blow the mist away. He has the ability to hide the traces of the elements of the wind. It does not touch any magic detection enchantment, but it is not safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol is not terrible. Even if the other party is a sergeant or a high priest, Siegel can handle it - and this possibility is too low. Which high-ranking caster will do nothing to act as a patrol here? The real trouble is the saints. If the magical alarm leads to the patrol, the patrol finds that he can't solve it, so he calls for a higher-order saint, and the situation becomes very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest ability of the saint is not to attack, but to defend against death. With divine power, they can constantly reshape their bodies, stronger at a time than once, and then continue their stalker. Under the entanglement of the saints, Siegel will have difficulty moving forward, and thus both the gods and the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we move on? There are still several miles away from the Yari Valley. God knows how many kinds of magic detection and magic defenses are in front, and will definitely become more and more dense. Even if Siegel hangs himself in the anti-magic field, suppresses and avoids triggering any magic traps, but he can't eliminate the vibration of his own feet, the smell of his own body, and can't suppress the magic enchantment of the whole forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that only people who are familiar with this lead the way." Siegel thought about it and decided to deliberately knock the bell. "On the one hand, you can also look at the guards here." So he withdrew a distance from the periphery and began to make earth elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for manufacturing is that Siegel is worried that the summoning spell will be seen. All the spells are traceable, although convenient, they cannot hide their origins. Even if Siegel is a very powerful elemental power user, it is impossible to avoid the fact that his summoning is found out. Manufacturing is another matter: in nature, where many elements are dense, it is possible to produce elemental creatures, which are often not strong at first, unless the environment is extremely suitable or the time will not exist for too long, but the benefit is not caused doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very likely that the volcanic lava is a fire element, and there is no shortage of water in the depths of the sea. It is not surprising that one or two small earth elements appear in this woodland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel condenses the strength of the surrounding earth elements, allowing them to polymerize in the middle, compacting them like a pinch of mud. Elemental creatures do not appear when elements come together, but also involve a part of the knowledge of elemental aggregates. Siegel carefully cares about the aggregation of the elements to get the environment, and sometimes mixes other elements into it, so as to promote the change of the elements to the biological direction as soon as possible<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From morning to noon, It is hard to get his attention until the sun sets and the scenery is beautiful again. Even with enough knowledge and ability to make elemental creatures in such a primitive way is still a challenge. In this respect, Siegel had to sigh the power of nature, and the magical power he possessed was really different from the creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the most powerful creation god can intervene before the formation of the crystal wall, changing the rules of the world with his own will. Although this is the case, what is the rule, how it is presented, how it is understood, and how it can be modified. This is a very difficult question, but Siegel must start thinking. His other plan is to find the power of the god of magic, which must include the power of the rules of the spell. What can be done with that power, and what needs to be done. This span of knowledge is like an insurmountable scorpio for Sigel, who is a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the starlight climbed into the sky, the bright moonlight came to the shoulders of Siegel with the falling leaves, and he finally made a soil shaped like a kitten. Elemental creatures. It swayed and stood still, and the four calves swayed constantly, trying to adapt to the surrounding environment. Seeing it trying to stand, Siegel held it with his hands, but only when it was about to fall. A few minutes later, the earth element topped Siegel's fingers and gradually learned how to walk on the mulch formed by the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a small earth element takes a long time to be able to dispatch a magical alarm array here, so Siegel casts a spell that periodically triggers on it. . After ten minutes, this spell will automatically cause a large accumulation of earth elements, and cover up the facts of existence with an explosion of harm to the earth elements. The high-speed mass concentration of elements is a typical feature of the ability of the earth to be released. If there are guards here, they must come over and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't avoid the magical array of the entire forest, can't you avoid the sight of several patrols? Siegel is far from the earth-element kitten, and at the same time forms an elemental field around his body. Just as the druid can melt into the forest, he integrates himself into the magical array of forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the spell will be like a flowing water, bypassing the rock obstacles in the journey, forming a whirlpool only where it is needed. Siegel is a rock in a river, but it is submerged under water, and it is hard to be detected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
