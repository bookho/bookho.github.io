			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the phantom is not more than the speed of the two sacred horses, but it has run faster than the ordinary horses. The Wind of the Wind is a rare king of horses, but it is still subject to the laws of nature. The phantom is only a magical creation, and the only thing that can limit it is the caster's spell level. When the spell is raised to the extreme, the phantom can fly free like a bird, faster than the wind, and the natural creature can't catch up with the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast grasslands, speed can determine many things. The two men and four horses keep moving forward, and the orcs can't catch up even if they find them, they can only helplessly watch their distant figures. With a single acceleration, Siegel can cross the range of the bow and arrow, and even the best shooter has only one chance to launch. They cursed, but looked at the four mounts with incomparably envious eyes, and thought about how to take them for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer to the walled mountains, the stronger the ominous premonition in Siegel’s mind, so they continue to spur the horses forward. When the spells can be maintained, they are on the phantom, but many times they also need the power of the king of horses. Especially after reaching the northern part of the grassland, the terrain began to fluctuate, with low hills and sudden rifts, and many predators were hiding there. With the smell from the air, the horse can discover and circumvent these troubles in advance, just as Siegel can save energy and close his eyes on the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you change, you can only rely on the phantom to move forward. After all, the horse needs rest, and the spell is not used. Kerry cut a white horse's mane with his body, and then placed two horses to move freely. After they rested, they could still find the owner by the smell. At this time, the city wall has changed from the shadow on the horizon to the giant in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The village at the foot of the mountain", where Siegel and Janet met Jeff, has now been occupied by the orcs and turned into a camp. The raven issued a warning from far away to prevent Siegel from slamming into the barracks. The information sent back from the air said that there are four hundred orc fighting units, and the flag of the wrapper is the wow. Strictly blocked the roads into the mountains and out of the mountains. The orcs were very careful, and there were whistle whistle around the camp, and four squads were dispatched to patrol. There is also a special camp in the center of the camp. The canvas is painted with the emblem of the one-eyed beast. It is probably the place to prepare for the witch festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know this way to the Black Blood Castle, and the orcs use a roadblock to block it." Siegel connects the magical pet with the soul, from the air Observe the surrounding terrain. "If there are two hundred people, it may be hard to beat the past, but now we can only detour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not saying that this is the only way. How? Going around?" Kerry is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not answer this question directly, but instead asked: "How much can you afford?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A few hours later, the two chose a place that was the steepest and least likely to climb and was therefore unguarded. The phantom is dispelled here, and everything falls on the shoulders of two people. Siegel casts a spell of spiders, and each person's hands and feet are covered by a layer of brownish black mist. When this layer of material touches any plane, it will produce a strong pulling force with the user's mind. So the two men, like spiders, climbed on the vertical cliffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc patrols also reached the place where the two climbed, but no one would look up. "It only needs to prevent someone from going down the mountain, and then all the teams trying to make up for the mountain are robbed. Even if the task is completed." Such an order makes the defenders here quite boring, they have been very strange why the black blood castle has not sent troops to fight for a long time. Isn't their food reserve so abundant that it is no longer necessary to keep the passage down the mountain? Fortunately, the orcs do not know that the prince of the starry kingdom is in the Black Blood Castle, otherwise it will gather a large number of troops, and the prince will be killed in the fight. The Beastmaster will definitely like this offering, and the orcs who have sacrificed for this heroic can also enter his temple after death, and will continue to marry and kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Morning Temple carefully guards this secret. Every day, a special priest prays to the Protector and envelopes the magic of defensive detection on the castle. . This is a contest between the Wu and the Witch. It must not be defeated, but it does not attract the attention of the other party for the pursuit of a momentary victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heavy guard, Prince Aaron can only stay in the deepest and strongest room of the castle, whenever there are four paladins and one The priest follows the protection. As long as you enter an open space, you need to open a large umbrella on your head. According to Cooper Griffin, the high-ranking pastor who led the escort team. The orcs have evil vultures in the air, and the witches use spells to detect the situation through the vultures. Therefore, in addition to ordinary infantry, priests, hexapod lizards, etc., try to reduce the number of occurrences in open areas to avoid attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to squat down like this, the straw in the castle is not enough." Speaking to Sir Bill, he still maintains the habit of exercising every day on the training ground. Especially shooting, it is very useful when guarding the castle, so he is not diligent every day. Another one who works hard with him is Evan. Even though his swordsmanship is already superb, he still does not relax the basic exercises of the day. Sir Bill thought of Siegel from the body of Evan, the same talent, the same effort. He would like to collect another apprentice, but he is also very clear that even if Evan is an illegitimate child, he will not have the title and power of the royal family, but it is still not a small baron that he can get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Baron, are you coming to save these poor scarecrows?" Evan said with a smile. "I remember that a heroic knight should speak with a sword. Why don't we come to ten rounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, happy." Sir Bill will Put your own sword on one side, take out an iron-clad epee from the shelf, try the weight and feel, then use it with both hands, put the horns in a standing position, and face the Evan in T. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still use a long sword to deal with your hybrid sword." Evan distributes the center of gravity to his feet, suddenly shaking his left and right, then fierce Ground thorns. The two swords touched each other gently. Only the sound of friction caused by friction. This is a sham move. If it is a force block, it will be biased, and a fatal blow will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly became a group, and it seemed that the situation was evenly matched. But Bill knows he has reached the limit. From the shocks from his hand, he found that Evan still has the spare power, whether it is strength, speed or reaction, he can end himself at any time. There is no chance of winning with swordsmanship alone, but there is not only one kind of swordsmanship in the world. Sir Bill called out: "Be careful. I want to use tricks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called tactics of the jazz are the usual tricks of mercenaries, the surrounding environment and the enemy's psychology. Use to the extreme. As long as you can gain an advantage, no matter what the means are. For a time, the chickens and dogs jumped on the training ground. In addition to the two training blunt swords, straw, chairs, wooden barrels, fire, horse dung and even soldiers watching the battles all became weapons of engagement. The two swords rarely intersect, but the scene is much more intense than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the means of the market, and Sir Bill’s attempt to teach Evan. This young swordsman is too attached to the sword, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Siegel is different from Evan. A type that belongs to what is used. Since the ambush in the snow, no one knows the life and death of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distraction of this moment was captured by Evan, and the long sword wrapped around the jazz's neck like a snake. "I surrender." The Jazz raised his hand: "You have won, as my captive, what kind of ransom do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With me Let's just say that there are a lot of people here." Evan noticed the audience around, and there were some mercenaries who were bought and betrayed at the time. He didn't like the guys who took the money to sell their lives. It was these reasons that made Siegel fall off the cliff. If he said that, these people’s heads should be cut down and worn with spears. Hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people will practice discarding with the sword, because the wood under the iron has been broken. Experienced warriors can detect the problems inside, but the recruits in the training may not. I don't know which hapless egg would smash the sword in the hand when cutting the straw target. At that time, the expression on his face must be worth a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you think of such a thing, it won’t make two people feel better. Standing on the highest wall of the Black Blood Castle. Looking at the fence, they are faintly able to see the orc team on the mountain road. A few months ago the team’s direction was from north to south and it has now come back. This time the orc showed an unexpected savvy, decisively gave up the iron foot warlord who had been surrounded, and began to retrace with a large number of spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The castle's trebuchet can obviously attack the orcs, but now all park like there." Evan flew a snowball with his foot. Watching it crash into the wall and smash it into pieces. "It's like a prison, it's even more boring than a prison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clinic, Evan." Sir Bill patted his shoulder: "All things Unsatisfactory, the war with the orcs will not only be this time, there is always a chance of revenge. Earl Todd is also to protect your brother, so as not to leak the news, so he did not move. This resolution has also been endorsed by most people. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
