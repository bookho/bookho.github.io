			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anchorage is a kind of huge movement difficulty, but the powerful weapon of the defending city, the steel wire rope with the winch can be the same size as the anchor. Launched out. M. If the mobile network falls into the crowd, it will be swept down like a mowing. Even the tough and huge body of the war tree is hard to bear such an impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wave of shooting got the best effect, the whole front of the elf was slow, and the eye was watching a war ancient tree cut in half, falling in Among the dust. The morale of the hub has been greatly enhanced, and many soldiers are cheering with excitement of arms. These people immediately paid the price for their lack of experience - the arrow of the elf shooter came instantly, and they pierced their throats. The defending soldiers immediately retracted behind the wall and dared to observe the outside through the shooting hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war tree screamed and slammed the speed, and the entire wall shook with their pace. The mechanics next to the anchors tried their best to pull the winch and try to attack a few more rounds. At this time, they screamed at the top of the eagle, and the elf druid's bird partner launched a dive attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defending soldiers raised their heavy weights and aimed the air to trigger the trigger. The lightning-fast black 弩 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织 交织<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the partner made the Druids very painful, but who told them to put the birds into the war? Some druids themselves changed into giant birds, ready to take off from the canopy, but the real wise elf is preparing for the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They expected the attack of the second wave of anchors to come, so they cast spells that drove off the metal. The weapons in the hands of the arrows in the air were all strongly repelled, and the guards wearing armor on the walls were more than seven twists and turns. The anchor weight is fast and fast. Although it was not bounced off by the spell like an arrow, it still changed its direction and flew over the top of the war tree, which did not cause damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids are wearing leather and holding a hardwood stick. They can use a spell called Ironwood to strengthen wooden weapons. Let them be as strong as steel. These people were not affected at all, but under the cover of the spells, they changed into various animals that could climb, and took the opportunity to rush to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of driving away from metal was only a moment, and it began to weaken as Druid boarded the city. If the battle is only druids and war trees, they can even make spell enchantments that repel metal. Unfortunately, the number of druids is too small, and the ancient trees of war are not invincible. The elves still need warriors armed with metal weapons and metal armor, as well as support from the Elf Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a melee on the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle between blood and fire steel and * is always the same, full of courage and sacrifice of anger and death. The human soldiers of the hub have occupied an advantage in quantity, and the former servants rushed to the wall. The Elf Druid can switch between the Beast and the Humanoid to launch a variety of attacks. But using fur to fight against metal will always suffer. So I quickly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapeutic spells shrouded the elves, and they took the wound off the city and returned to the war tree. On the one hand, it is to give way to the Elf Warrior, on the other hand, it can also concentrate on the use of magic to protect the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the big trees use the branches to firmly grasp the stone of the city wall, and the feet are rooted and pulled outwards. The cracks in the stone walls continue to drop gravel, and many places are beginning to loosen. Humans pour flammable kerosene on old war trees and then ignite. The old tree made a scream. Still no loose hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid summons the water element and tries to extinguish these flames. The fire oil of the pivotable castle cannot be extinguished by water and can only be washed away. Fortunately, war trees are very resistant to fire. The skin is difficult to ignite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war-old trees that were just shot by the anchors were not so lucky, the flames plunged from their wounds and raged in them. Druid uses spells to quickly close the wound. Without air support, the burning will not last for too long, and the ancient trees of war only need to be as patient as possible to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although rushing to the city. But the elf began to feel the pressure at the beginning. The bow from the castle's arrow tower poses a great threat to the elf. The ancient tree of war is behind the elf warrior. It is no longer possible to provide protection against bows and arrows. Although relying on the pace of the elves can increase the chance of dodge, but in the war. No one can guarantee that no mistakes will be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martial arts can't be used too much at this time, and luck is the biggest reliance. This is a hurdle promotion attack initiated by the elves, while the other side is a human warrior who is waiting for the battle, and the addition of the red minaret locks the victory. Accurate energy missiles kill a large number of Elf warriors, and the violent attack is blocked by spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel observes the situation far away, because it is possible for Heim to face a similar situation. He saw the heroes who fought back heroically, and the elves who were clothed into three formations to cover each other, and they understood that this was just the beginning. The elf only responded to the sneak attack of the Mage Federation, and this attack tempted the defensive power of the hub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger rushed up and used the bow and arrow to suppress the human guards in the city. The guard, who did not hide his body behind the shield, was shot quickly and stumbled down the wall. Some Elf Rangers work together, one shoots the edge of the Iron Shield, and the impact of the arrows causes the defender's shoulders to sway and reveal flaws. This is another opportunity for the Elf Ranger to seize the fleeting moment, shoot another arrow from the gap and kill the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy missile of the Master Tower turned to attack the Ranger, and the arrival of the Elf Master made this attempt miscalculated. They specifically countered the spells of the Magic Tower, blocking spells such as the energy missile and the sour arrow and the burning rays. They reduced the variability of the battlefield, so that the walls only need to use force to solve the problem. However, this time the elf did not have the idea of ​​taking the wall to win the wall. The ranger used the bow and arrow to suppress the advantage, but the soldiers began an orderly retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also took the fallen elf companions along the way - some were dead, but most were seriously injured and temporarily unable to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁 At this time, the castle trebuchet at Hubburg started working. This type of trebuchet is not intended to attack the siege equipment in the distance, but to kill the enemy under the wall. Countless graves squat down, the target is the elf's caster group: those mages and pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old war tree took back his hands from the wall, raised it high, and then stepped back and twisted his body. The fallen stones were covered by the canopy, and the mage and priest below were safe and sound. At this time, the Elf Warrior withdrew, and the Ranger seized the opportunity and shot the last few arrows in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their goal is very clear, they climbed the wall and let them see the situation of the defenders, so the Rangers are all aimed at the defensive weapons that threaten the elves, fierce oil It was the first to be attacked. The Elf Ranger chanted the spell and let the arrow bring the flame power, cross the battlefield, and rushed to the warehouse where the fire was screaming in the screams of everyone. Despite the accumulation of sand and stones into a storage room, it is still a temporary building, and the gap between the sandbags is used by the elves. After a loud bang, the explosion of fierce oil smashed all the knights within ten meters, and then the flames flew around, igniting the slinger anchor and the soldiers farther away. The thick smoke covers the sky, and the defenders on the wall need to put a lot of energy into dealing with the chaos, and it is too late to stop the work of chasing the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient trees of war cover the elves, preventing them from being hit by the trebuchet and slowly retreating to the distance. They left a burning wall, the body of the land and the human guards who did not know that they were defeated or defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf is repelled!" Someone cheered, and soon the hub was immersed in the celebration of excitement and excitement. The elves and their huge trees have been repressing the people who fled, and this sentiment was raised to the apex when the war broke out. In any case, the retreat of the elf is obvious, and everyone finally has a way to vent, hug each other and cry and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taiwanese ears" raised their swords high and began to cheer for victory. He needed to add confidence and morale to the soldiers in this way - if not Those recruits may collapse in the next battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are just a simple raid and temptation. They don’t have a lot of deaths, and all the wounded are saved. Where is the number of deaths in the city to be several times the number of sieges? This is definitely a failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Stephens knew very well that the elf was not so good. They can quickly adjust their tactics on the battlefield, never make the same mistakes, and the cooperation between them is tacit. With the help of geographical advantage, the hub has almost used all the means, but the results are not satisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time the elf comes back, here is still just the slinger anchor and the smoldering oil - and the smoldering oil is burned a lot - the elf is definitely ready I am afraid that even this battle will not be achieved. The only variable of war is at the Masters' Federation, and the red magic tower is the only possibility to defeat the elves. The lord must be rushed to come forward. Whether it is a pleading or a threat, the wizard in the Magic Tower River must participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
