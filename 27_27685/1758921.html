			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton was uncomfortable, and until now he has not figured out what happened. When did the thick fog dissipate? How does Siegel get rid of the thinking probe? Why are you not aware of all of this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he has been exposed to the vision of the Southern Coalition, it will have a tremendous impact on the next step. He speculated that Serra betrayed himself. This sly woman must be a power and status and want to climb up inside Knox. Who is her ally, Eric or Jeremiah? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he was distracted, and must be the sequel to the long-term use of thinking probes. The monster's body makes it difficult for him to stay focused and is not suitable for casting spells. The deformation gives him a strong body and specific ability, but hides his belongings and cannot be used. He also has scrolls, spell sticks, and magic stored in the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Felton changed back to the human form, using the roll to escape the attack of the long sword. He inspires the protective spell on the ring and protects him with a colorful shield. The Rainbow Light Ball is the strongest of the protective spells, and each of the colorful colors corresponds to an effect. Weapons, elements, vomiting, venom, mental attacks, and spell effects are all blocked by the iridescent barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only with different spells peeling protection layer by layer can you attack the caster behind. Felton can't use this spell with his own power, even his teacher, Casper, can only partially use the Aurora. This magic ring was discovered by a Knox Kelly Collison from a ruin and handed over to a Casper Master with a thick book. This ring later came to Felton, and he regarded it as a treasure. But many times he couldn't help but guess that the ring is so strong, is the book left by the master more valuable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow of the ring can only last for a dozen seconds, just enough for him to recover. The healing agent and the medicinal remedy were poured out by the mouth, and he also nested several protective spells on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at him with a smile, took a few reels from the space bag and inserted them on the belt. Felton is very strange, why Siegel does not use protective spells. What is the scroll on his belt? Is this the tactic that Faranis taught him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw the dirt next to it arched, and a soil element was drilled from below. This is in the expectation of Felton. The elemental guards of Heim’s collar are already well-known, and the lords of the South think that it is a new product of Mora’s. But the Knox Association’s intelligence shows that it’s all Siegel’s invention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of the earth is not afraid. He has prepared the element to dispel the spell for a long time, and can call it back, but the subsequent things make him unexpected. A half-orc with a giant sword, an elf female shooter and a bearded dwarf carrying a glowing warhammer climbed up one after another. Surround him in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding earth elements has turned into a five-on-one situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a plan that Siegel has long established: use the excavation ability of earth elements to connect to the duel venue and bring your friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Mana, who continues to preside over the wall defense, Leah, Zucker, and Dwarf Locke all sneered at the so-called "battlefield duel" of the human lord. The hero of the leader is to lead the team to charge and always stay on the front line in the battle. The battlefield duel is nothing more than a game in their view. It is a flashy story like "romantic" and "legendary". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not have any dissatisfaction with Siegel’s arrangement, but he was glad that he was not stunned and still able to calmly think about the problem and use all resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the rainbow light ball gradually disappears, first purple, then blue. At this time, Siegel has already put up a long sword. One hand wand, one hand reel. He used his opponent's spells to speed up his actions, which is more effective than light spells. In addition to the speed of movement, it also increases the speed of response and the frequency of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf's warhammer glows pale, which is the ignorance of the gods. Locke is full of confidence, and the Devil Warhammer has a dispelling effect on all kinds of magic shields. Although the effect on the Rainbow Lightball is limited, other spell shields are difficult to bear a few hammers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Lia gently spit out the Elven language "speedy enemy", and her longbow responded to "killing innocent." The weapon that received the blessing of Luna has been drawn, and the golden arrow of the feathers is aimed at the heart of Felton. Although the Knicks have not yet fired, the Knox Sorcers have felt a sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iridescent shield has become almost transparent. The dwarf Locke took the lead and rushed up. His heavy hammer slammed on the shield, and a gust of wind blew, and the last trace of protection disappeared instantly. The huge anti-shock force made him back two steps, but the thick thighs were firmly on the ground and still balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's feather arrow straddles the battlefield, and the golden lightning strikes straight away. Felton was prepared. The arrow-protected spell blocks it according to his mind. The momentum of the feather arrow was contained, leaving only a shallow wound on the enemy. The elf once again bent and built, but the half-orc covered the shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Mike to be so anxious, but Elijah can’t blame his comrades for being sensitive? She silently put on the feather arrow with the elf rope, and constantly walked on the outside to prevent the enemy from escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rushed, Felton had begun to cast spells. His eyes smashed the camp of the Southern Allied Forces, and the spell of any door was on his tongue. As long as you leave this battlefield and save your life, the only thing left is to slowly change the attitude of the southern coalition lords. He thought about his excuse in an instant: it was a good reason to be transformed into a monster by the evil wizard's usage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even thought about using magic items to explain the problem of casting spells. When facing the Master of the Master, he used several pieces of spells from the family. This is no big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did not expect that any of his own doors actually had no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-white chain emerged from behind his back and fixed him in the real world. Any door, transmission, or alien door can't take him away. If he wants to improve his movement speed, he only has the choice of acceleration and lightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc’s great sword fell and he had only one choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chose local deformation and replaced himself from the left shoulder to the arm of the battle lizard. Thick scaly covers it, and underneath is a layered joint that provides multiple defenses. Even if the giant sword was cut, it only broke the outer scales, and even the muscles were not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good sword! Good sword!" Mike is going crazy. If he has a good weapon. It won't be so embarrassing, and nothing is cut off! He forced the sword back up, but did not expect Felton to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are awkward!" The Sorcerer rounded his eyes and killed a giant sword with one hand. The other hand exudes a black aura, which is the ghost touch of the Boda corpse. This frightening undead can be touched and touched, and the creatures it touches are hard to live, so it is a huge threat to all creatures. Undead biological deformation is still a field that has just begun to contact Felton. It can be regarded as super-level in the use of local deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black paw failed to hit the target. Because a pair of mud made up of big hands stopped it. The earth element blocked the attack with its own body, and the black light of death did not help him. Felton's eyes widened and he looked at the head of the earth element and slammed it over his nose. He can only maintain two local deformations at most, and it is too late to defend. The vertigo of a whirlwind, the pain of the broken nose bone penetrated deep, and even the spells on the body are difficult to maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must run away and do everything you can to escape. Felton is strong in spirit, while pulling back and defending the spell. He has already guessed that he has a meta-anchor in his body, so he will never spend any effort to use any transport-like spells. He wants to fly, but it still takes time to get rid of the wall of the force that is set on top of his head. It is better to become a gas, as long as there is a gap to escape, the general weapon is also difficult to cause damage to the air. As long as he has a breath, he can recover by transforming into a regenerative monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gasified body's spell flashes with a beautiful glow, and magic will take effect soon. Siegel took out a scroll early and used it at the same time as Felton cast. The "Remove Magic" spell is one of the most commonly used spells of the Master, and can fight most of the spells during combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of magic collided in the air, and the attempt to vaporize the form failed. Felton looked at Siegel with resentful eyes. The latter smiled and said to him: "Guess what are these reels on my waist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This time he finally understood the mind through Siegel's body language, those are damn "de-magic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
