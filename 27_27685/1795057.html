			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"13,000 years? Is there a problem with this number?" Siegel frowned and asked: "The wall of the storm is our world. Is there a special phenomenon that was not born with this crystal wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All historical records are yours, Raywall Continental Naturally surrounded by the wall of the storm, behind the wall is the world of God. "William waved his hand and said to Siegel: "Is it all the same in the world, isn't it strange? I think there is a kind of Power is affecting everyone's ideas so that people don't doubt it. Only those who travel far enough can get rid of this inherent thinking. The wall of the storm is very powerful, except for the internal travel of the world. Nothing can penetrate it. Once I came to Heaven Hill and asked if the angels there could see the soul of a great pastor who had died. They said that they had not received any rise for 13,000 years. The soul of heaven. I know the morning sun. The real body is in Heaven Mountain, and he will not leave his followers unless the ascension channel is blocked by the storm wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a Big problem." Siegel thought of the shadows of the dead, those souls full of resentment can not dissipate. "What about the other planes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too dangerous to go to hell to find someone, but I’ve searched as much as possible, and the Mountain of Heaven The same. I asked a lot of people, they thought that this situation is very special, but they can't give an explanation. But I heard a few words by chance. When they called our world, they used the 'dead wall in the destruction ball. 'As a name.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I want to specifically ask about this, people who use this name are not recognized." William said: " Later, I discovered that only the world that is about to die will have such a name. That means the disappearance of a crystal wall, including all the creatures inside. So I can understand that the dwarf god asks the dwarf to dig the channel. The action of opening the wall system barrier I also pushed the Federation to pass a plan to hide a weak point in the wall, for the same plan. But I have to worry about the reaction of the big prophet Lear, because from the current situation, he is likely to be magic . Spokesmen in this world "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Siegel looked at William, but he kept his head down, seems reluctant to let Segal know his face. Such a move is very strange, making him confused. However, he still said: "I believe that you are saying that the wall of the storm destroys the world, but this cannot be evidence that Lear is a sacred person. I mean. I have seen two saints and it is easy to feel them. The power of the body is different. If for many years, countless people who have seen Lear are not aware of this, I can hardly believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Holy One?" William shook his head, then finally looked up and looked at Siegel's eyes: "The bachelor Faranes once believed that Lear is the magic god himself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real body is coming?" Siegel couldn't help but smile: "Leave a safe country of God, come to a crystal wall surrounded by a devastating storm, for what? When a school city predicts "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he wants to understand why the destruction of the storm did not destroy our world?" William is very confident in his theory: "It is difficult to die." Avoid, if there are special cases, shouldn't you study it well? For God's knowledge and magic is definitely more than the lives of attraction "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; William looked out the window, eyes full of vivid memories. "French Faranis is the closest bachelor of the prophecy master. He is the prophecy. He is also a teacher, but he always said that he is still a little worse and cannot be a master of prophecy. He feels that he is staying in the Masters Association and will never step on it. After that last step, I came to the New World and joined the federation. At the beginning, I and Alexander thought that Faranes and Lear were only academically divergent, and later discovered that this was not the case."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is hiding the secrets of the world, deliberately obscuring the key information by some means, letting everyone turn a blind eye to it. This has surpassed the mortal's ability, but in the mortal means Can find its clues - no power can be produced out of thin air without foundation." William sighed and said: "Because of this, the Faranis talent promoted the merger of the Federation and the Knox Association. I hope to find a way to influence the way of thinking in a wide range from their spells. But because of the long-distance cast, the lifespan is shortened, and I can understand this secret. He died before the secret. He opposed the Caspar Master becoming one of the Big Three, but nominated Shelley, Weywood and you. The Lion King is a dead-end, thinking that only the ** division can become the Big Three. So I finally chose Casper, and I lost the suppression of Knox, which led to the collapse of the Federation. Among them, the Masters Association is definitely helping, but I was trapped at the top of Mola, failed. Stop it all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faranis once said: "Siegel, disturbing your destiny has brought very serious consequences, even my sorcerer can't bear it. Your destiny is very different from other people, I noticed. With me This lesson, from now on, no one can influence your destiny, your way can go by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to go back to that again At that time, ask him what the meaning of this sentence is, maybe you can know more. But at that time, Siegel’s brains were all excited about “getting rid of the fate of being manipulated”. Where would you think more? Even in the depths of his heart, there is dissatisfaction with the fact that Faranes is intervening in his own destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person can teach a student in the last days of his life. He put all his guesses and inferences down, just telling about knowledge. Siegel asked himself if he knew that he had only a life of less than a week. What will you do yourself? I am afraid that training a student will be one of the most impossible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf broke through the barrier of the crystal wall. Trying to immigrate to the world of goblins. Difficult to say is not a decision before death. This thing succeeded in succumbing to everyone until they failed. Suppose that what William said is a fact, the wall of the storm is not special, it is the power of the destruction of the crystal wall, but the special thing is that it did not destroy the world this time. The dwarves understand the danger of destroying the storm and try to escape. Can this thing really blame them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William cleared his throat and said: "Divine power can do a lot of things. But the most power-consuming thing is to change reality. God is generally in the outer plane. Do this and form your own kingdom of God. There is no rule of the wall, and God will become very powerful in God, so this kind of thing will be done by every god. But if I assume the magic and the god of knowledge Once there existed, he was a very powerful class in every world as a concept god, and our world should be no exception. But now, he is gone, then where is his power gone. It is impossible to disappear from the air. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel blurted out: "He can be used to change the knowledge and cognition of the entire continent, letting everyone ignore the special features of the storm wall!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case!" William squeezed his fist: "This way. No one will leave, he can easily observe the cause of the destruction of the storm. All gods Will be interested in this matter, even We will reach an agreement to ensure the smooth progress of this observation. Isn't this the same when our Master is conducting a joint spell test? But the agreement reached by the gods uses a higher level of power, even the strongest in the multiverse. The power of order can be achieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat in the chair and only felt that his head was splitting. His hand touched his chest, but he touched the twenty-faced scorpion under the clothes. Although there is no conclusive evidence, all the speculations are concentrated on themselves and concentrated on the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how to be the most special one in the world, it’s a very complicated feeling. Excited because of my uniqueness? joy? Fear or loneliness? It is difficult for Siegel to clarify this emotion. In dealing with emotions, he has not been able to do very well. Many times he does not know what kind of mood to use to face the facts, so he can only think hard and think with reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not all things can be solved with rational thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he will choose to escape. "William Master, all this is very convincing, but there is still no evidence. I will fully support the decision made by the Federation, especially the secret development of the Wall Channel. But after you have said this, let me How to deal with the Masters Association and the City of Learning? I think it is best for you to see their representatives on behalf of the Federation. Moreover, this is the responsibility of your identity. I am represented by Heim, the Masters Association. The representative is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I won't go see them." William shook his head and was very firm: "I am different from you, I I have no ambitions for spell spells. At present I have been able to travel in various worlds, my wishes have been met. You are the apprentice of Faranis, you are the kind of person who solves the problem, I will only ask questions at most. Although the federation needs The Masters Association adds spells and some books, but if you don't talk, I personally have no opinion. You can call this escape, or I am conservative, but I will not change my mind."<br /> < Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel laughs and laughs. He takes out a notebook from his arms, which is a book that is used to record urgently needed books and materials. "If you can bring this spell from other worlds, I don't have to deal with the Masters Association. Is that okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
