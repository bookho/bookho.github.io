			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz took the lead and followed the horses and they began to go downhill. Soon the sky was covered by dark clouds, and then it rained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This rain is just a shower in the early summer, it won't last too long." The jazz said: "We can safely cut off the shrubs that are blocking the road, not afraid of being dog-headed." People heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and took out the sickle to help. The thorns are tough and hard, and with the rain and slippery, it is always difficult for Siegel to break them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To find the point of force, don't use brute force." Sir Bill took his long sword and made a demonstration: "It's going to break out in strength." Need to hit the place, or a little further. Also pay attention to your hand holding the weapon, protect your wrist, use the elbow as a support point, use your shoulder to drive the force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "When you hack, use a blade, facing the direction of the wave. Only adjusting these subtle angles can ensure that your weapon is not slipped open." Sir Bill taught patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel listened to the words, and then tried to adjust himself. The sword and the sail were completely different. He would still be stabbed by the rebounding thorns. It is clearly the vines wrapped around the roots of the tree, but it seems to have life, always avoiding the moment when the sickle is added, resulting in the desired effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stupid, do you think these plants will not move? This wind, the rain and the vibrations you have caused will shake the thorns; Your shoulders, arms and fingers are not as strong as you can, and of course you will be twisted. These plants have nothing to do with you, so that you can use such great strength, how can you control it? To know that it is difficult to control accurately, If you want, cover the direction of the other person's retreat, block, and detachable. First calm down and take a deep breath. Don't worry if the kobold will run away. Don't think that you will delay the progress of the task. Don't worry, slow down, you need it now. Learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Siegel is not an idiot, he quickly adjusted his breathing, and his feet stood in a T-step, correcting his posture little by little. He threw the ropes and pitched the harpoon, and the line was farther than anyone on board, but he hadn’t adapted to stand on a completely stable land—when many seafarers came down from the boat, they Call it "halo wave." Siegel has been on the ship for 16 years, and it has only been two months since he landed. In his mind, he recalls the action of Sir Bill and the Kobold, imitating how he slashes his sword, how to swing his sword, how to move his footsteps to avoid the kobold's dagger, and how to stay flexible and balanced at all times. Gradually, Siegel realized some experience and immediately applied his muscle response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill looked at the young man and found that he was exceptionally spiritual in using weapons. In the process of learning martial arts, ordinary children will repeatedly sway between right and wrong, and they will progress after they have suffered. Siegel will also be wrong many times, but as long as he can do it once, he will be able to fully remember this experience and will only become more proficient on this basis and will not be wrong again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all fairness, the knight’s first job to learn in the first month is to fetch water, cook, make a bed, and have a fire, caring for horses, maintaining weapons, and repairing protective gear. It is the work content that the followers will begin to contact for more than half a year. In less than two months, Kegel has not only done it all, but also far beyond the progress. He can start to learn simple weapon skills, which has surprised Sir Bill. Now Siegel's skill in wielding weapons quickly breaks away from the apprenticeship and is more and more like the Jazz himself. This is definitely a good seed for practicing martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, little nephew, you are progressing very fast, you are already qualified for the job of slashing. Now you start the road ahead, I am walking behind Sir Bill patted Siegel's shoulder and handed his long sword over and replaced the sickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young follower maintains this exquisite sword every day, and has long been aware of its length and weight. In addition, Siegel itself is strong and powerful, so waving a long sword is not laborious for him. But today, I don’t know what’s going on. Siegel feels hot and hot with his hands and feet as long as he swings his sword according to the standard action he wants. This feeling is unusual, but it is very comfortable, because this heat will spread throughout the body as he continues to break the thorns, like a refreshing spirit in the cold winter. Siegel almost upgraded his swordsman by step by step, and soon he was no longer satisfied with the simple squat, but mimicked all the actions that Sir Bill showed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men marched faster and faster, and later they could not feel the obstacles to the advance. Siegel quickly took a path from the jungle, faster than the skilled gardener trimming the turf. They crossed the two low slopes, and the rain stopped at this time. Sir Bill stopped the entourage and took back the sword from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop and rest for a while, Siegel." Sir Jazz said: "I am tired and need to drink some wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grin, have to wait The instructions stopped. He put the horse on the root of the tree and slowly pulled out a leather bag from his backpack. The jazz sat on the ground at random, reaching for the wine sac and sipping a small mouth. He suspected that Siegel stood unsightly, so he ordered him to kneel on the ground and pretend to be a dead fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hands put your feet up, this fish should not die yet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine is Purchased from Ximu Town, it is inferior and cheap, as long as it takes a little longer, it will be converted into the direction of vinegar. Sir Bill’s mind is not at all on the wine, but rather about how to train the young Siegel in the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own use of family swordsmanship, mainly based on two-handed swords, is a martial art of heavy warriors. Only later as a mercenary, often faced with some narrow, chaotic terrain, the enemy will be surrounded by all sides, completely different from the soldiers on the battlefield, so he switched to a one-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His long sword hilt is slightly longer than the average one-handed sword, which not only ensures the center of gravity when using one hand, but also the feel of the two hands. The blade is also thicker than the traditional long sword, and more focused on slashing rather than puncture. Siegel’s current body is still in the growth stage, and the strength needs to be honed but not overstressed. He needs a suitable weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most suitable combat technology for Siegel's physical condition should be the Elf Scimitar, giving full play to flexible body movements and quick and fast slashing. This swordsman will only have some fur, and his good friend Elijah Amastasia is the master of this knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sir Bill couldn’t help but start calculating his assets again. They don’t have much money left. They want to make big money and must go deep into the New World. Many opportunities. Ximu Town is too close to the coast and is one of the famous ship ports. People coming and going are quick to get around and it is difficult to find a decent job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally he planned to stay in Ximu Town for a while, train this new 扈, and wait for the first half of the year to go inland. It’s just that Siegel’s growth is far more than expected, and everything will be called a school, which will greatly shorten the time schedule. The jazz couldn't help but think of the message that the dwarf Elint gave him at the Brookwood Town Tavern: "Lunar Eclipse Festival, Dragon and Lion Cliff." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill knows the meaning of old friends, and once again in the three-year eclipse day, they can circumvent the stone statue guards of the mine and enter Cave exploration in the depths of Longshi Cliff. The last time they saw it was going to be successful, but because of the lack of time, they couldn’t move away from the treasures that were close at hand, and they could only quickly exit the pit. They agreed to gather again after three years and be ready to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This convention is a jazz will definitely go, he also misses the warm and hospitable dwarves, especially the beer and roast lizards in them. According to the current training progress of Siegel, they also have the ability to advance westward and go to the multi-furnace to meet the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, you listen, it seems that something is close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are quickly alert, They took out their weapons, hid behind the trees, and carefully observed the direction of the sound. The war horse used his mouth to untie the reins and slowly squatted behind Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kobolds walked through the woods, dressed in ragged clothes, carrying spears in their hands, marching and arguing while marching. One of the kobolds was carrying a dying monkey on his hand. He kept shaking the spoils and let the unlucky little creatures continue to mourn. The Kobolds took this as a pleasure. They threw the monkey back and forth or fell hard on the ground. The Kobolds have the habit of abusing weak creatures, and they are capricious and willing to take the lead, making them very popular with other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill dismissed the longbow from behind, aiming with an arrow, and then shaking his head. The woods are too dense, and the kobolds are running around, and the difficulty of archery is too high. So he gestured to Siegel to wait in the same place, then changed the sword, lowered his body, and quietly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the command is the virtue that the knight must obey, so Siegel suppressed his militant mind and had to stay patient. Because they were covered by showers, they were already very close to the Kobold Camp on the lake, so Siegel estimated that after solving the two hunters, the Jazz would probably go straight in and end the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
