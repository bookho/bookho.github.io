			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet dare not say more, in case too much urge will cause the opposite to be alert. This is called a rodent, and the dwarf thinks sadly. He can't move now, he can only lie on the ground, looking up at the stars in the sky, watching them staring at the dark night, like the crystal veins in the underground cave. But for a little while, he felt dizzy—the stars are not the gemstones in the veins. They will slowly change their position over time and gradually disappear from east to west. "The Lord of the Guardian, please let the time go slower!" The dwarf kept praying in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Elijah Lia, it is equally anxious. She was curious to know what happened to the three sorcerers who had just entered the cave. Why did one escape from the blood, one person lacked eyes, and one disappeared? Did they encounter Siegel? Did the young man survive? She didn't dare to think deep. She looked up at the cave several times and looked at the stone ladder used to climb. "Maybe I can rush up this time, I won't faint in the middle of the road." The elf's heart has an impulsive voice that encourages her to take risks, but at the same time there is a sensible voice that also expresses her opinion. "After you go up, leave a break. Is Ellet's leg alone here? How long will the magicians find this thing? Can the dwarf survive without a remote threat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is definitely not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has never been so slow, and the dwarves are still hoping that they can live a little slower. At this time Knox's casters shouted: "I can't believe your current conditions. After all, you first sneaked into the camp and killed our people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you want? Deadlock and wait for the Dwarf Guards to kill you all over here? Here is the New World, the Mora, the territory of our dwarfs. Under the hammer, the steel will melt!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your archers stand where we can see, and then let a road open." One-eyed shouted: "Don't try to do any threatening moves, otherwise Let's break the fish. The death is just another beginning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go. Today's things have come to an end!" The dwarf has no choice but to accept Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sorcerers whispered and discussed the conditions of the dwarf. "I think there are ghosts, the dwarves are stubborn ones, how can they compromise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think it is right, but Carlos, you can still Is there any good way? It takes at least four hours to restore the full spell power. It was already dawning at that time." One-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dwarf watchtower may have ignited the wolf smoke, and their patrol reinforcements are readily available," Carlos added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all you stupid. If you look at the tower on time, you won’t let this group of bastards succeed. Those mercenaries will only get in the way!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not talk nonsense, if you change to you, will leave when you are about to destroy the guardian golem? Besides, I stay in the camp and let the three of you enter the cave, in exchange, I have already smoothed out the mistake. So don't mention it to me! You should talk about it, what is the gain in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, damn it The Collison guy snatched away, Jomi was killed by him, and I lost one eye. Damn, I will never let him be better!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer looked at his one-eyed companion with suspicious eyes, only to believe that less than 30%. ‘Leave here first, I have the opportunity to find out the truth. He thought of it like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed also knows that the more complicated it is to discuss things, the more quickly it shouts to the dwarf: "Well? Where is the elf? We can't see it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly found his class was surprised to use his finger to his waist - there is a place to hide the folding fortress. ‘Is it seen by him? In an instant, the one-eyed eye is ready to attack the spells, and concentrate the power of life at the bottom of the box to the fingertips, ready to fight for wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, what's wrong with your pocket? What's inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I Only one good eye, once transferred to the line of sight, is dead, so I can't be fooled. This time it is not that you are dead or that I am dead! The one-eyed sorcerer completed the last measure of the spell, and a burning ray spurred out from his little fingertips. His companions didn't anticipate the attack, but the daily countless training made him try to shift his body and try to avoid the deadly spells - plus the caster had only one eye to aim, so the rays were not so accurate - His left rib was burned through a round hole where you can see the charred organs and melted bones in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible and silent shock wave erupted from him, swept across the entire camp, and everything was swept away—rocks, camps, supplies trucks, and sorcerers, all flying out. The one-eye without any magical protection becomes fragmented and then cleaned. Only the "holes under the ribs" and the sorcerers remained intact. A force field shield was displayed at the last minute, exhausting all the protective forces and successfully resisting the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the original one-eyed sorcerer existed, the black-eyed Siegel was standing inexplicably, holding the key to the space in his hand. A little starlight is swaying at the top of the key and then slowly extinguishing, just as the space is off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Folding space superposition effect! Damn, actually stealing space equipment!" Carlos Sorcerer was angry, and his greedy eyes also stared at the West. The key in Geer's hand, it must be a high-level magical equipment. He even felt the magical energy fluctuations that the key issued in a moment after the explosion. Despite the impact of the explosion shockwave, he struggled to concentrate on the spirit, barely controlled the energy of the spell, and cast a ghostly field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel originally read in the Rubik's Cube. According to the habits developed in the library of Mora, he first browsed the contents of the catalogue and books and prepared to make it. Read the plan. When the books on the bookshelf were scanned, he thought that there were still a few books that were thrown into the key space—just experimented when I just got this magical equipment. So he took out the key and recited the "unlocking" whisper. The Rubik's Cube suddenly violently shakes, and everything around him is broken and rotating. Then Siegel saw a strong aperture to bring him in, and the aperture seemed to contain countless bright stars that stretched into a vast galaxy. The image only existed for a short while, but it was deeply imprinted in Siegel’s mind. Then he saw himself standing at the foot of Longshiya Mountain, surrounded by a mess. He looked around and found a sorcerer from Knox, who seemed to be cursing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel reacted violently, and he released the key in his hand and let it fall to his chest naturally. It’s too late to pull the machete from behind. The fastest weapon to use is the dagger on the belt and the flying axe hanging on one side of the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a large hand made up of gray fog swooped over and stretched out five fingers to a two-meter radius. When Siegel had no time to resist, he was shackled, and he was wrapped in the impact and rolled back. The sorcerer waved his hand and ordered the mercenaries behind him to help. Siegel found that the guys were stiff and quick, and they took out the sword one by one. I am afraid that they will be separated by a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to survive, Siegel brutes the brute force, and the heart struggles to deliver energy to all organs of the body. He used the bones and muscles to the limit like the plateau barbs, trying to stretch out the big hands. The gray mist is like a life, mourning under this barbaric tear, and then the pieces are cracked, and the balloon that finally explodes dissipates in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How ridiculous is this?!" Carlos Sorcerer had a moment of disappointment. He quickly read a spell, but was affected by the injury between the intercostals. The spell power collapsed without being built, and the spell disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashed the dagger at this time, and the other hand touched the flying axe, rolling from a prone position into a half-squatting posture. A sorcerer who was closest to him flew over, the meteor hammer was spinning, and one ellipse was drawn in the air. The eyes were empty and faceless, so Siegel couldn't judge which angle he would attack with a meteor hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feather arrow shot, the middle of the eyebrows, straight into the brain. Siegel knew that this was the wizard master who assisted him in the distance. He also saw from the corner of his eye that the dwarf Elinett was using the warhammer as a support, jumping on one leg and moving to himself, shouting: "Come on the power of the rock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox of the Knox Commonwealth is hiding behind the three warriors, holding their hearts in their hands, gathering the power of the next spell. The red light shines from his palm and shines on the sly face, depicting a twisted and crazy shadow. Wu Lingling said nothing, cold as a machine, only knows to execute orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cover me! I take the enemy emirate!" Siegel shouted and bounced from the ground, speeding up like a cheetah. He took out his left-handed flying axe and slammed his long sword near him, bounce off the obstacles that had been on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used a shoulder in the process of charging, and squeezed the first cockroach, he must hurry every second to rush to the caster. "Close to the magician, forcing them to make mistakes!" The dwarf's teachings still echoed in the ear, so Siegel did not stop at all, and rushed toward the Carlos Sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
