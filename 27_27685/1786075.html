			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come and come!" Mike pointed to his head and looked very excited. ←, "Is it a long time for me to speak a dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, this is the case." Siegel said: "But I am still alive. Man has tested it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana's eyes widened and stepped back: "Is this safe? It won't turn gram into a frog. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That will certainly not. I have instilled the elemental creatures with the martial arts of the dwarves and elves, and it is still very effective."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is that element?" Mana asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead is dead." Siegel smiled and explained: "It is the death of the war, not because of the spell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 is more interested in this: "Siegel, can you teach me martial arts by the way, I always want to learn more about the skills of the soldiers, especially when the sword and the shield are used together. My yangyan sword is always shining, attracting the attention of many opponents. The knife and fork sword is not afraid, it hates the arrows that are shot in the air, so it is better to have a shield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wu martial arts is different from language. It also requires physical coordination. This technique can't be done. The shape of the fire element can be constantly changed, so the martial arts taught it can adapt quickly. Our two heights, weights, and arm lengths are all different. I teach you your own martial arts experience. The most likely result is that you can't control your body and you won't fight."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That line, I am not greedy, you should teach me the dragon language first." Mana looked triumphantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master put his hands on the top of the Orc's head while swearing and cursing. Although Mike's hair is messy, it is still clean. He closed his eyes. A very enjoyable look. There was still a sound in the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel presses the thumb of both hands behind a certain part of his head. Zucker turned his eyes and fainted. Then the spell began to take effect, and there was a constant current jumping on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana, who was watching at the side, sighed and decided not to try. By the way, if the knowledge can be "filled in", can Siegel also read the memory? In many stories, the evil witch can do such a thing. Although Siegel is not evil, it is not difficult to think of his skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he sees some private things from my memory. How is that good? Mana bit her lip, nervous for a while, and the determination to not accept the spell became more determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell lasted only less than a minute, and as Siegel took a shot on the half-orc's head, Mike jumped out of the chair. His hair was still slightly smoked, but the spirit looked good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up a piece of parchment from the desk and wrote in the dragon language "I can pinch my nose if I can understand it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucker squeezed his nose. Then he reacted and yelled: "I can understand the dragon language!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so excited and gasping, his eyes were turning . Then he seemed to want to say something, but he snorted and grabbed his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Siegel and Mana ran quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc is swinging his hand. It didn't matter, and then licked his tongue. Then he pointed at his mouth. In a vague voice, he said, "Twisted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana screamed out, then laughed uncontrollably, holding the wall to stand firm Body. Siegel tried to endure and handed him a bottle of therapeutic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 shakes his head, "Mess (nothing)". He looked at Mana with some shame, and the expression made the horsewoman fall into a new round of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that there is no problem with reading, but you still need the cooperation of your mouth and tongue when you say it. This is somewhat similar to the situation of martial arts." Said to Zucker: "I will talk to you in the Dragon language below. If you don't understand, shake your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike nodded and said that he understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also for safety. I won’t use this spell for the second time, so you should start to consolidate.” Siegel moved a thick The history book, the content is not important, the key is written by the dragon language. "There is no other good way to read it while reading it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼 sucking in a cold air, it is estimated that he never thought about this. When the thick book was held in his hand, he felt that the paper was heavier than the two-handed hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a lot of books in the Long language after the book is copied, some very interesting." Siegel noticed the face of Mike’s crying, Thinking about the chin, then clap your hands and ran over the bookshelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he took a book with a blue cover and wrote "The Collection of Yaron Man's Maid" in the dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Mana asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A collection of poems." Siegel hurriedly said: "I think the history book will make Jack feel bored, maybe poetry will be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc obviously didn’t know what was in his hand, still crying and holding his book and leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Zucker managed to learn the dragon language very smoothly, and even wrote several new poetry collections - that was a long time later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new winter is coming, and there have been many changes in Heim’s collar. The power of the collective collaboration of the mages is very strong, and the Federation’s magic training school has begun to enroll students. When you are at leisure, it is a good choice for your child to go in and learn to write. Especially the lord also provides two meals a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food is very simple, the porridge is the most common thing, sometimes there are fish or smoked sausage. Learning is boring, and the mages are still patiently looking for new ways to improve the efficiency of literacy. "If there is no Knox this is fine, some of their spells are still very useful." Some wizards can not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found a few smart and loyal people in his knight and knight attendant, and then added temporary language knowledge to them by means of memory infusion. . These people want to keep this matter secret and then send it to a higher level teaching class at the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first breakthrough was the illusionist mages. Everyone has imagined that the infinite element supply of fireballs, ice storms and the like will be very powerful. But very little attention to illusion. In the various schools of the federation. The illusion system is also not out of pick. However, after the establishment of the new federation. The chief of the illusion department, the human mage Hodge Daller saw the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He studied the elemental channel spells carefully and then created the image crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the principle of constant function of the element channel, he can create illusion images and sounds at a very low cost, and then replay them continuously. Although it doesn't have much value in other places, it saves a lot of time for the mage when teaching. Those repetitive tasks are handed over to the illusion, and the mage only needs to answer various questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after a long time, you can also specialize in an image crystal ball that focuses on answering questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This greatly improves the efficiency of teaching. The illusion of the image crystal has also become in short supply. In addition to the Federation itself, the order of the "bubble" bar in the city of Myrtle surprised all the wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of the halfling boss is very simple, I hope to be able to make the image of the dancer, and replay it in the bar every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusionist Hodge has been thinking for a long time, and he is undecided about whether he is serving a "low-lying" bar owner. Many of the Masters of the Federation turned their attention to him after knowing it, and it also put a lot of pressure on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calculated it carefully. Before the secret nuclear reactor, the cost of making such a crystal ball would cost around 4,000 gold coins. The price would be nine thousand. Left and right, it is not something that ordinary people can afford. Only the Star King has customized an image crystal. An image of Barrett Star II and his eldest son Barrett III was recorded. In the past, making an image crystal helped the illusionist pay for a lot of magic research. It is a good job. Now the cost of the crystal ball is only a few tens of gold coins, and the price can be adjusted to one hundred and it can't make a few dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
