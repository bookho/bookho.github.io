			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers from the Elven Forest launched an assault as it seemed sharp enough to cut the horn of the frozen rock. WwW.XsHuotXT.com They are in front of a group of colloidal warriors, both sides have their own spellcasters to help out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle started in a rain of arrows, and then the winner was defeated in the fourth arrow of the rain. The elves stepped over the full body of the iron shell and used a machete to solve those still-knit warriors. As for the servant of the murder god? All those who did not scream "to surrender" also faced the same end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ultimate elf did not take any captives, but bundled the surrendered people into the army led by Heim. "These are human captives, we don't handle them easily." When I heard this, Mana couldn't wait to slap the opposite elf. The elf is not easy to handle, is Heim's collar handled? These captives are not left, they are not, they are completely hot potato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's hurry to find the Lord's Lord and ask him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean the battlefield, dismantle The trap in the site still takes a while, so the first to find Siegel was Evan and others who were in the stronghold. Under the treatment of a whole space bag of potion, the group recovered their mobility. Only Arnold's eyes were stunned, and the burn marks left on his face were shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about me, I have another pair of eyes now." Anomen kissed the earth's mother's emblem in his hand, still looking very optimistic: "I am always ready You can see the goodness and evil spirits around you. These rays leave shadows on the objects and mark the obstacles for me. I only need to adapt to the adaptation and what will happen to my actions."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up a small stone and threw it at him. Although Arnold's reaction was slower, it did sense that something had flown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Anomen is our hero, or a wounded!" Naria said with dissatisfaction: "Don't bully him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at her with a sigh of relief and kept looking up and down. Soon, Naria was embarrassed. The excuse ran away to look for the warrior Seger and Yao En to move the chair for Arnold, to hold the wounded and sit down, and then face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, or Yao En said: "Well, this task is completed? We are directly paying from here or need to go to the city of Miele Crossing? Of course, I feel that you are also capable of accomplishing the whole thing by yourself. We have not helped anything, but it has become a drag. If you don't want to pay, let us search here, this time will not lose money... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. Yao En, you have completed the task." Siegel said: "If it weren't for you, I am afraid I have burned my brain and lost it." Reason, then one fell into the trap of the sacred murderer. When paying the fee, there can be no, if, that will affect my credibility." He took a package of cut gems from the space bag. Handed it to Yao En and said: "I don't have much gold in my body, only the gems are left, you can hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En opens the bag, roughly I looked at my eyes and then reached in and grabbed it, only to tie the bag tightly. He reached out and held it with Siegel, then said: "I am very happy to serve you, the Lord Lord, I hope to serve you again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gently shake your hand. Siegel is a little sad. He patted Anomon's shoulder, then said goodbye to Yao En, and returned to the transfer room alone. The Elf Saint is suspended in the air, and uses the gaze of his eyes to resolve the front of the array. Siegel stood at the door and leaned against the defensive staff. The light of magic shines on his face, but casts a long shadow behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that he is different. The simple days of the past will never return, but he did not expect to remind him in this way. Apprentices who want to get paid for themselves to buy a small bow are now the employers of adventurers. Even if you complete the mission with the adventurers, you will not feel the joy of victory. Shouldn’t the companions be hugs? Now there is only a handshake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the more powerful the more lonely it is? If they know that I have reached the level of the division. Is it only going to be far away, not even shaking hands? Siegel also thought that the wise Yao En could be his own support like Bill and Elinette, but he obviously missed it. Yao En belongs to the Baimen squad, not the Siegel squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Janet is still there, then I know where I can find the harbor where my soul is anchored. Home is a place where you can let go. For Siegel, who is full of powerful magical energy and has the power of every move, it is a place to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Saints left a glowing sphere in the air and landed next to Siegel. He noticed that the Master was fascinating, so he made a note and caught his attention. "Siegel, it is very troublesome to analyze God's creation. If it is not the god of murder, it is also the god of order. At least his power will show law. This is a completely impossible task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I will continue to trace the murder god and Chanem, help you also help I myself.” The Elf Saint said: “Even if I leave the instrument here, it takes a long time to crack the work. You still need to pay attention to the news between the market, the murder god will not give up the development of believers, otherwise his There is no source of divine power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of what Rees had said to him: "I heard a message, I don't know if it is true or not, say You listen. Maybe only the gods can tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the sorcerer the god of murder to tell the elves, and then Said what happened in the dwarf mountain range of Mora. He said while paying attention to the expression of the elf saint. Unfortunately, this time, Siegel couldn't see him changing again and again. Is he no longer happy, or is this news basically not affecting him? He couldn't help guessing the reasons for the ecstasy of the elves before, and thought of their strange looks, the destiny without God's response, and the strange scorpion on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he knows is that if you ask at this time, the Elf Saint will definitely leave. I can't get any answers, and I will lose the biggest help in finding Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a need to confirm this thing you said, I believe that the gods of this world will immediately investigate the matter." The Elf saint said: "If you It is true that the god of murder violates the agreement and order between the gods, and his power will be deprived, no matter what means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, at least this will be good news." Siegel nodded. For the things between the gods, the Masters have never been in charge, because only in this way can God avoid the things that God intervenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been around you for too long, so you won't see me again in a while." The Elf Saint puts his hands in his clothes. In the robe, bow down slightly and say goodbye: "Goodbye, Lord Siegel. The squid Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't wish me all the best, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need my blessing, you already..." His words had not finished, and his figure was shaking. The elf saint smiled helplessly and then sent away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stayed in the transfer room for a while, then left the transmitted beacons and the arrays that could be monitored remotely. Even when he was immersed in the creation of magic, he could not completely forget the thoughts of his heart. Is this character really suitable for becoming a mage? Sometimes Siegel is doubting himself. Perhaps the singular form of Siegel is the most perfect mage state, and regardless of the various resistances brought about by the physical degeneration, Siegel. Nakis. Squid has the same understanding, spellcasting ability and knowledge, and more Calm, calm, and never will be affected by emotions. It always makes the most optimal choices and can go further on the magical path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of what he thought in his mind, he made a wrong line of a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." He got up, wiped the last line with his wand, and then heard the voice of the female knight behind him: "rarely See you mistaken, Lord Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "You said it wrong, except Janet, you have seen the person who made the most mistakes. But I am very fortunate that I am completely correct in choosing your contemporary lord and army command. Thank you for coming to support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Executive lord The order is our duty, and we vow to do it, you don't have to thank us.” Mana said: “Mr. Wywood wants to talk to you, and I have something to ask you.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
