The federation still needs you, and the life here will It will be very different from the federation.” Siegel looked at Wendy, who stood quietly in the room, patiently persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of Reid has left. He welcomes the like-minded pastors, so he has been eager to prepare his home for Wendy. As a golem, it doesn't need to rest, just need to have a quiet corner for prayer is enough. Wendy has her own place in the city, but she said that she wanted to live in the temple for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the temple except for the reliefs on the walls and some of the usual lamps, like an empty warehouse, lacking in energy and lacking vitality. The dwarf runes on the wall absorb the outside sunlight and transfer it indoors, giving a soft glow from the ceiling. But this light can't drive the pure, orderly and indifferent feeling of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is the second light source in this room - if you use psionic vision or detect magic to observe. The power of the element is slowly emanating from him, and the spell and power are mixed in the power of this element. Those who are sensitive to magic will feel close to a certain heat source, which will make the skin sweat slightly, but will never hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compared with him, Wendy is much quieter, hands folded in front of him, bowing his head to avoid Siegel’s eyes, but staring The direction of his heart. Legends and gods will be controlled, at least be enchanted or hypnotized. Wendy didn't know if her protective spells could avoid that, but she was very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose to be the priest of the magic god and willing to give everything to the magic god. It is not important to have any magic. It is important that this is my own choice. In doing so, I can both gain peace of mind and relive the vitality of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will not have results." Siegel As much as possible in a soft tone, but there is always a cruel indifference in the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, anyway, you can't give me a result, so what is the difference between me?" Wendy squeezed her fist and nailed her hand into her hand. Among the skin. She lifted her head hard and concentrated all her spirits on Siegel's eyes: "As a friend of the federation, you are not qualified to stop me; as the lord of Heim, you should be happy that there is a sergeant in the temple. As a magical god, can you deny my determination and sincerity? What are the reasons for you to stop me here? Are you disguising your inner joy as a jealousy? Siegel, you have too much control. I want to be a pastor, and I am not rushing to give birth to your child! The boy in the city of Mystery who uses paint to change the color of his hair and eyes... How can I not even compare her!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...I..." Siegel hesitated, and finally did not get entangled in this topic. "Well, in this case, you are willing to be here here, I really said too much, the tube is too wide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and left, I left the temple without returning. Wendy shouted out behind him: "Siegel, as a person, you are a jerk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can see Wendy without looking back Silent tears, he raised his hand, the spell of modifying the memory is on the lips, it is not difficult to change things according to their own wishes. But this spell can be carried on, and the majesty of God overshadows the humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally let go, sighed and passed away from his temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the establishment of the Temple of Magic was quickly passed out, but the news that the Marquis of Siegel Squid became a magical god was even more amazing. The attitude of polarization in this matter is unbelievable on the one hand, and it has evoked the ambition of many people to become gods on the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in the history of the entire wall of the wall, this is the first time that someone has become a god, crossing the obstacles that everyone thought was insurmountable. At the beginning, someone rushed to the side to find the pastor to ask and ask where the god is. Some people even think that as long as they can kill the previous gods, they can automatically take over as a new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Siegel a little unexpected, and I didn’t expect human ambitions to be so big. Other gods are far from hiding in their own kingdom of God. The ability to travel without a plane is a paranoia. But everyone knows where the magic god is, so many people came to the city of Mire and launched an assassination of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are truly capable will weigh the pros and cons, and at least plan for their actions. Those who crashed into the city of Myrtle were purely stupid. The city defense forces of Heim's collar are elite under the training of Zucker, and nearly one-third of them have received basic magic training. It is still unbearable to use simple spells to cast simple spells. Simple stealth and stealth can't escape their investigation, and all the soldiers equipped with firearms have amazing fighting power. Most of the intruders were brushed down at this level, and their endings were relatively better, at least most of them retained their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to avoid the "elite" of the soldiers and find themselves facing the double barrier of the elemental rune warrior and the lamp god. They easily disguised the disguise and smashed all the enemies that had been mixed into the castle. These people were eventually hanged on the execution ground, and the body was burnt into ash and sprinkled in the shield river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one person sneaked into Siegel. He did not come to the city of Mith after Sigel became a god, but began to lurk early. She started from the laundry woman and almost went through all the work outside the castle. This was transferred to Janet and helped take care of Megan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she did not mention the name of Siegel once in a while, she would not be discovered. Although Siegel did not focus on listening to mortal gossip, such close hostility caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one look, she was all recruited. As one of the "cats" of wiki culture, her mission is to monitor Siegel and see if there is any move. But it's hard to explain how hostility came about, so Siegel didn't let her go, and direct usage digs up her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only saw the wiki, but also saw Lear, who together gave her the task. "To find out the exact location of me, is it best to leave me in the city of Mire forever?" The female spy's face showed a painful twisted expression, and the whole body was sweating like a wash. Her heartbeat has reached the point where it is about to burst, and the self-consciousness has long been blurred. Siegel treated her to ensure that she would not die from torture, and on the other hand continued to strengthen the power of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In memory, Lear made a clear indication that it is not allowed to hurt Siegel’s wife and children, so as not to trigger a full-scale conflict. Compared with whether Siegel is a nobleman of the kingdom, he is more concerned about the location of the dumplings. He also gave the spy a close instruction to Siegel, preferably as a secret mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Miele, the people arranged by Lear should be more than this one. Now, although Lear is not there, some people may give up the task, but they are not allowed. Some people will lose their restraints and threaten Janet, Isaac and Megan. By counting the number of residents, Janet and Mana worked together to clean up the secret agents of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one hundred and thirty people, there are special spies, and there are also people who sell news for money and other purposes, including several nobles. These people will stay in prison for at least a year, and several craftsmen who leaked firearms plans were beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is Siegel’s lord power, but from the perspective of the residents, it is a murderous action. Heim’s collar has always adopted a moderate rule, preferring to do things slower and more carefully, and to take care of more people as much as possible. Beginning with the eviction of the Rune Wall, the authority of the Lord's Lord must be carried out, and there must be no opposition in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I decided to hand over the power of the lord to Isaac within a year, then... then I have to concentrate on the issue of the Wall of Storm." Siegel convened The small council, this thing did not take advantage of his son. In fact, he looked at the astonished expression on Isaac's tender face. In fact, he was still very happy. Maybe the little guy thought that his father would never die, and he would never have to inherit the entire Heim collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, Isaac is less than eight years old, maybe it would be better to give him a city or manage some aspects of the city." Janis wore gorgeous aristocratic costumes and the moustaches were neatly trimmed. By managing and participating in Heim's foreign trade, the smugglers of the year have now become the richest people in Heim's first place. "I think it would be better to start with business, and you can broaden your horizons. Otherwise, you can start from the army of Mana. It is a very important part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, there is no need to waste this time, I have decided." Siegel looked at his son and solemnly said to him: "I know very well that this is a strong man, but you are not alone. My current status is not It is suitable for long-term command as a lord. It is necessary to know that divine power can easily affect the thinking of ordinary people. I will hand over all things that belong to mortals and avoid excessive interference of divine power. But you can rest assured that I am not leaving you, just wanting Keep a distance from the trivial things that Heim leads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
