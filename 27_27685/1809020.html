Can you say that he invaded?" Some wizards shook their heads and faced the crowd with a narrow smile: "His magic ship is parked at In the sky, there is still a long way to go from the Masters Association, not in our jurisdiction. The land below it belongs to Baron Eddie, a good old man with no skill and temper, let him face a royal Marquis? No direct squatting It’s not bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Siegel has affected the order of the Masters Association and must be severely punished!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"H, he cast illusion in the sky, in addition to affecting sleep, what harm can be caused? If he uses any insulting words, he is just doing business."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged mage wearing a sky-blue robes raised his eyebrows and stood up from his seat: "Doing business? He is collecting high-level spell scrolls, and these scrolls are not available." Mage Federation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& "The resolution made at the outset did not assist the so-called Masters Federation because it could not prove the inheritance relationship with the former Masters Union." Master Shaw Gerard said: "All the colleagues, the association has not prohibited The current federation and its main member, Shiger Squid, have a relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people shook their heads. "He is not an evil, backward master, but he has made a lot of contributions to the development of magic spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement has been endorsed by many people. Some even proposed to introduce the Siegel squid to the Masters Association, and urge him to abandon politics and the life of the Lord as soon as possible, and study the magic spells wholeheartedly and make a good transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement can only make people laugh, but Master Shaward did not show a smile. His eyes kept looking at an empty seat. That belongs to the prophet Master Lear. It is very strange that he is obviously in the Masters Association and has not attended this meeting until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he doing. Did you admit defeat in this link? Master Gerard fell into meditation and even placed himself in the position of Lear to think about possible countermeasures. Cloning is indeed a good spell. As long as the actual effect is as much as half of the rumor, it is irresistible to anyone's appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows what kind of spells will be created in the future, and at that time the Masters Association will not get anything. The reputation of the Nile virus No. 1 has made many Masters taste the sweetness and they want to continue to have this treatment. But the whole continent, the person with the strongest innovation ability is not the Master Association, but is isolated by the association. Now that he is good, he will certainly be able to gradually put the high spells together, and the so-called knowledge blockade has lost its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of Siegel has been overwhelming. This is not only in the power of the lord, but also in the magic stage. Gerrard had his own thoughts. He knew that the Siegel Master could master the legendary spell sooner or later, and he gave him the key to open the door. He also received a good relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Masters Association offer? Gerard himself summed it up: a perfect knowledge system, an accurate spell record, a good experimental environment and an absolutely safe living environment. As long as these are still there, the Masters Association will not be truly threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the conference room was pushed open, predicting that Master Lear walked in. He still maintains an elegant posture and a confident expression. The temperament that everything is in control is something that no one else can learn. Gerrard observed him and tried to find out the impact of Siegel on him. But what did he think and he couldn’t find anything, was Leer hiding too well or was there no problem at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just when Lear passes by him. Gerard was keenly grasping the breath of negative energy. Did Lear show the Necromancer spells, or what are the undead-related items on his body? He wants to feel it carefully, but he can't catch the breath anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am late, there is an experiment just happening at the crucial time, I can't get out." Lear sat in his seat. Next, said: "Where is it going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the Siegel squid is arrogant outside the door." A mage said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because of the magic ship?" Woolf, the plastic energy department, held his own moustache, and some dissatisfied said: "Starry royal family. When can I get to the Masters Association? Lear Master, you are sure The article is about the association, not the school city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"School City also received the same news, I just came back from there." Lear Spread his hands and shrugged his shoulders. "Under someone's suggestion, His Majesty King asked me to step down as the chief university student of the school. I can only retain the position of the Masters Association. The reason is that the school has always had no powerful spellcasters, all of which are knowledge research and consultants. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is too wide-minded? Many caster talents are not very good, but the clear-minded mage chooses to go to school development, although it is a routine But it does not mean that this is a hard rule. All this must be the idea of ​​Siegel squid. His influence on His Majesty the King is too heavy. Is it possible that he used some kind of spiritual control spell?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my observation, no." Lear shook his head: "But you all know that Knox will join the matter, and many of the synagogues of the federation are close to each other. There are various kinds of protection spells, but they are still unconsciously controlled by the spirit. It is said that Knox's full set of spell books is in Siegel, so everyone should continue to be careful, especially when facing him."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald In disdain, that means to scare people will fool the common Master, Grand Master in the middle can have a market? He tapped the table and asked Lear: "Historically, the kingdom of stars expelled the Masters Association, and we had to establish a school. Now the King wants to mediate, how to mediate, is it just a few words? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille looked at him with a smile on his face and said: "His Majesty has agreed to our plan and will use the power of the king to start the legendary law." Array, control the world of goblin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a commotion in the venue, everyone was excited. Some mages even clap their hands together. Lear took his beard and waited for the voices of the people to be a little smaller. Then he said, "This is good news. Although the legendary rule locks are built by us, we need the saints and gods to master certain rules. The power of the people can be started, even our legendary mage can't do it. But if you let the power of God participate in it, then the good situation and the initiative will be gone, and the key to maintaining the security of the new world will fall into the hands of others. Our Majesty the King is the morning god. The saint, although he does not have any divine power, but as the guardian of the human and the king of the stars, he also has certain regular power, plus his king's blood, enough to open the circle!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the plans are carried out step by step as we had expected, including the opportunity to mediate through the King's Majesty. Recovery and cooperation with the Federation. We need the secret nuclear and also need The serial transmission array, these must start from the federation!" Lehr went on to say: "Siegel is a dead brain, he did not really realize his potential, but has been It is smug in the position of the lord. History has proved that the higher the talent of the mage is, the more politically suppressed it is, the more likely it is to try to unravel the shackles of the body. With us, unlocking the shackles means lifting up The flag of the lord. The last time we were sheltered by the Master of the Mage let us alienate the human kingdom. This time, if this happens again, the consequences will be more serious. But even then. Can we watch a genius being persecuted?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, he will be the door to the outside world, can the people of the starry kingdom catch him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The audience suddenly became silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear shook his head slightly. The tone said heavily: "I am very sad to hear this! All the people present are **, of course, knowing what the door of the outside world means, let alone the kingdom of stars, we can't catch him! As soon as we come, we will completely lose such a genius, what a great loss! Moreover, we have already suffered a loss, do we have to fall in the same place? Siegel is young, proud, blind, can not see The danger behind it. Do we see him making mistakes? No, the Masters Association shelters every Master. Especially those who can contribute to the development of magic. This kind of shelter also includes not letting him make mistakes!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage, although not very impassioned, gives a good reason for the Masters’ action against Siegel. Let Siegel be a simple mage. Putting down the burden of the lord is, in a big sense, good for him. At the same time, the separation of the lord's lord's attributes is also a kind of protection for the federation. The Masters Association basically reached this consensus and acted accordingly. Since it is necessary to resume cooperation with the Federation, it means that it can provide its library with relevant information on high-level spell knowledge. The union will have it, and Siegel will naturally have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
