			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry puts down the things at hand, starts crazy exercise, and enhances his fighting reaction. Leah told him some tips to improve coordination and speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was busy with his own business. He took three riders and ran through a hundred miles around the tribe. He used various methods to check the anti-magic sacred land and finally determined that it was a circular area with a radius of 50 kilometers. Although the Jackdaw tribe is not in the center of the circle, there is enough depth around the tribe to resist the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to test the effect, Siegel used the first summoning of the Necromancer spell. He summoned the cockroaches from the frozen corpses on the prairie and ordered it to move in the direction of the Holy Land. Controlling the Necromancer is a very uncomfortable experience. The anger of the living, the desire for destruction, and the resistance to the control of the spell are all passed back from the soul of the soul. The flesh-and-blood body is hard to adapt to this intense emotional shock, and Siegel finally understands why the Necromancer's temper is exceptionally eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骷髅 After being entered into the Holy Land, it was gradually weakened. After walking less than three hundred meters, it lost control and became a bone piece scattered on the ground. This is good news for Siegel, and the Holy Land has sufficient protection for the Necromancer. It seems that both the spirit of the ancestors and the spirit of nature are disgusting to the undead, and the spirit of war has deteriorated this temper into a mana, destroying the unclean monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it, changed himself into a form of sacredness, and entered the scope of the Holy Land. He had to personally experience the effect of this place. This is a very risky move. Siegel keeps in mind the time and location of the disappearance of the cockroach, and constantly reminds himself that he cannot surpass that limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the Holy Land, everything around him seemed to have not changed, and the imaginary attack or the purification of divine power did not appear. Siegel tried to take a few steps inward, twisting the squeaky bones and carefully watching the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the three spirits are not the idea that the division found the secret here, so Siegel has nothing to gain. There are no magical fluctuations, no elements to gather, and no concentration of divine power. This is somewhat similar to what happens in the gold armor death knight. But now is not the time to think about it, because it is about to go to the last time when the cockroach is destroyed. Siegel didn't want to test the limits of life and death personally, so he immediately changed back to the original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts that have just been made in a state of inspiration inspired Siegel, and his research on the scope and effects of the Holy Land can come to an end. So he rode back to the Jackdaw tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the horse was down, Siegel went straight to the "Three Spirits Hall" and asked the priests here for questions. Although not a magical caster, Siegel still wants to know the knowledge of the Three Spirits. And the characteristics of the priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is always a place for people to always fight in the world for survival, always returning to the earth, and the body becomes part of the new cycle." The priest said: "The soul Actual existence, whether it is ghost, bound spirit or some targeted prisoner spells, can prove this, but no one knows how the soul came from. The secret distance of life creation is still early, let alone full of power. The soul of the soul came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, my Siegel’s hand said: "You are a mage, you have mastered a lot of spells, that is your strength. The source of this. But this alone does not explain anything. You can't explain survival and death with magic and spells. You always have ancestors, why not ask them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you can, I would like to ask for your help." Siegel replied: "I don't know who my parents are. This has been bothering me for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priest nodded. Handed over a small gray tile containing a piece of charcoal that was the size of a nail and slightly swaying Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your hair, nails, or anything that grows out of you," said the ritual, adding: "Don't give me magic." Or other means of regeneration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and scraped his newly grown beard with a dagger and placed it on the plate. The faint charcoal fire instantly burned the scorpion, and a nearly transparent smoky smoke rose slowly. There is a word in the mouth of the priest, calling for the appearance of the spirit of the ancestors and blessing the descendants of his descendants. In the Siegel, all the syllables are meaningless. It is impossible to concatenate sentences into sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your blood is so weak, it seems to be from nothingness." The priest's shoulders began to tremble, and his words were intermittent, and the teeth squeaked. . "But your ancestors are extremely powerful. They have the power to control the world. I don't understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the broken disc is crisp and sweet. The sacrifice is sober and sober. He seems to have experienced a long-lasting fight, and his whole body has collapsed, and he has fallen to the ground with powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for interrupting the spell and saving my life." The priest said: "My ability is not enough, my ancestor guardian can't reveal you to me." The secret of your body. Your parents and your origins are still hidden in the mystery. Only by crossing the barriers of mortal and divine nature can you get a glimpse of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, you know that our world is surrounded by the walls of the storm, and after that is the residence of the gods." The priest explained to him. "The three spirits we believe in are the gods who are unwilling to go to the dwelling place of God and would rather sacrifice our eternal life to look after our good gods. The ancestors, nature and the spirit of war are on the dividing line between divinity and mortal, so we can give I have this answer. Only when I join the team of Sanling can I have enough knowledge to read your past life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond the mortal, to reach the divine? This is clearly impossible.” Siegel said with a wry smile: “I should change the question and ask how to fight Knox. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing." The priest replied: "There is confidence in victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, stood up and was about to leave, and was stopped by the priest. The priest hesitated and screamed, and walked into the corner of the room with his tired body, and smeared with a crumpled hand on the cabinet filled with debris. He found a small cloth bag, and took out a round box that was not much bigger than the coin, and gave it to Xigel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spirit of War says that this will give you directions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel At first glance, it is clearly a reduced compass, and the pointers and scales above are clearly visible. However, it does not emit any magical fluctuations, it has already been damaged, the pointer can no longer rotate, how to guide the direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for courtesy, he still took it seriously and put it in the space bag. The priest said to him: "This artifact can only be used when you are most lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, Siegel finally waited for himself. The raven returned. He brought back the letter from Dwarf Elinette from Mora, and a power of attorney with a pass. Siegel opened the letter and was relieved after reading it. Since he was on the summit of Mora twice, and had a good relationship with the dwarf Rune Master and the Gem family, his warning about the Knox Association was taken seriously, and the Mora has begun to take precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s specific plan will not be revealed in the letter, but Elinte promises that the Mola will be the most solid ally of Heim. He also told Siegel to be careful, especially the next plan. In order to be safe, he also sent an elite team to Longshi Cliff, where he will meet with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Master is not something, it is the Guardian Golem of Dragon Lion Cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the folding fortress left four magical statues to guard the gates of the residence. The Knox Association tried every means and eventually destroyed two of them, so when the Longshi Cliff adventure was over, there were still two statues standing on the platform of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Recently I reread a book: "The Study of Magical Decoration," with some new ideas." Siegel explained to Kerry: " In the past, I felt that there were many sayings in the book that were whimsical, but as the knowledge of spells increased, I had some new ideas. It was not gibberish, but I couldn't understand it at the time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Golem the kind of statue that will walk?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Most of them are bulky and powerful, with good magical resistance and melee ability." Siegel said: "The devil is a mage." The best escort, but the cost is expensive, the manufacturing cycle is also long. "Magic Decoration Research" mentioned the most fundamental manufacturing elements of the magic image, the power core, the magic system and the outer shell. I learned when I made the elemental guard. The dwarf's rune technique, the gnome's illusion also gave me a lot of inspiration. I think I can make a simplified version of the Golem system. But I need experimental materials and can't buy it through the Masters Association."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry didn’t understand most of it, but he summed it up: “Just hit the two Golems and capture them?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
