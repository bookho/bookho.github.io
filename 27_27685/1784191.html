And our two basically intact standing in front of you, the physical state and the beginning of the battle are not much different. There is my magic array on your head, and the magic enhancement effect of our two bodies will take a long time to disappear. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black people interrupted the Master's words: "I am different from them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel shakes his index finger in front of him: "According to the distance between us now, before you can threaten us, I can send away with my companion. Can you stop my transmission spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can't, why should I spend this effort?" The black man said: "Mage sergeant Siegel, in fact, I have a simpler way to stay with you. It’s better to say this. If you leave, I will start assassinating everyone on top of everyone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his eyes, this dangerous assassin could not stay and must be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But don't worry, we don't bother to do that." The black man stood up straight and his arms hang down naturally, just like relaxing the muscles of the body. . "Assassination is a challenging thing. You can satisfy the great gods in both strength and strategy. And you never want to hide your whereabouts and never fear the challenge, so it is easy to find you. There is no need to kill civilians. We believe in the god of murder, not the god of tyranny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that after he said these words, his hands were loose and thrown Drop the dagger and uncover his mask. The face of the sorcerer Jarrell Carindo appeared in front of the Master. He was expressionless, and his muscles seemed to be stiff, no longer the kind of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long time no see, Siegel. Squid." He said: "You received my black warning?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, how long have you been tracking us?" Siegel didn't relax, his body was still tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yariel is like a stiff woodcarving, standing still opposite, only the lips open and close: "I noticed when you entered the starting point, I will Behind the welcoming team, hide in the crowd. Only your attention is on the Cavaliers. Where will you see the people behind them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not to mention these nonsense, if an assassin is determined to hide, how can the unprepared mages detect it?” Siegel snorted: “Yarell, you know that I am a promised person. It will be done. I will give you a chance, surrender, tell me everything you know, I will let you live well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yariel shook his head firmly, his voice There is no trembling. He said: "You saved me twice. I owe you two lives. The black warning is to return you once, and another time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!" Siegel waved his hand: "I was forced to help you in the grassland, and what was the other time? I don't accept the inexplicable favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "When the red dragon appeared, the camp was in chaos, the guard was burned, the cage burned in half, so I seized the opportunity to escape. You attacked the red dragon and attracted its attention. If it was two seconds later I will be caught up by the dragon's breath, and I will be buried in the sea of ​​fire. So you don't know. But it really saved me once again." Jarrell said: "It is very important to kill you, but if you don't finish it, These two lives, I am not pure, and can not be completely reborn from the hands of the murder god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you still have to keep it, It’s just like this.” Evan, who said this, did not shake his hand, and there was no fighting in his heart. Excitement - but that does not mean he was off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I insist on returning to this matter. You are ranked very high among those who are worthy of assassination, and they have also been among the best in the list worthy of scoring and digging. I have to say that your performance in the Elven War is very satisfying to Wei Shen. The skills, timing and control of the situation are in line with our philosophy. Some people propose to contact you. But Wei Shen personally vetoed this proposal. I will take you out of the development list. Unfortunately, you have no chance to listen to the teachings of the Great God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this matter, I have to be good too. Thank you,” Siegel said. “The god of murder is constantly making killings in the New World. Is it to declare your existence? Do you not know that the elves are guarded by the moon god, he has taken the crimes committed by you in the Elven Forest? Action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't leave any sequelae in the attack of the Red Dragon? How do I feel that you are having a fever?" Siegel snorted: "After the war, where did the murderous gods come from so many beliefs? Ariel You are cheated by your god! Hurry up and wake up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarell put away his smile and snorted to the ground: "Shut up, The ignorant squid, your knowledge and spells are meaningless in the realm of divine power. You live in your own illusion, you don't know what is happening in the real world! You love elves, but they fight you, just like you. Don't say that you don't feel the deep water city. Oh, don't you feel the dwarf in the deepest part of your heart? You didn't hear the sorrow from the depths of the earth? Sadness, pain, these are just by-products. But the second planned genocide is what my Lord wants to see most. You live in books, there are only perfect stories and simple characters, and it is much easier than complicated and gorgeous reality!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard the genocide, is the dwarf a lot of death? No, it should not be like this. The dwarves have their race gods, the powerful forgeer Moradin, under his protection, there is no danger of genocide. The most likely but the most unreasonable speculation is that the dwarves are planning to destroy others. Will they make such a ferocious thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is not willing to admit, but deep inside can not completely deny this possibility. The Elven War is over, and the Dwarfs still haven't reopened the door to Mora, what are they doing inside? From the information sent from various places, there is no risk of involving dwarves. Even the dwarven kingdom of the old mainland is as calm as usual, and has maintained contact with neighboring countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, just now Jarre also mentioned the "second" genocide. So what is the first time? No matter which race or organization the history has, there is no record of genocide. Only a few biological groups have become rare and endangered. But these should be the mother of the earth, obviously not enough to make murder. The power of the god rises. Since it is not in history, the only possibility is that no one is recorded. Things like this are just like Siegel knowing one thing: the "writers" are dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but shouldn’t it be caused by the wall of the storm, how can it be associated with the murder god? Siegel continued to ask, but only exchanged for the ruthless ridicule of Jarrell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to know this, you want to know that, why should you ask me? Is it the god of knowledge and magic?" Jarrell activities the neck, then It is the shoulder, then the wrist. The two short swords circled behind him and the cold light flashed. West <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s observation is more acute, and it is found that Jarre’s fingers are doing complex gestures, similar to the spellcasting action, but with a taste of religious rituals. In it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are ready to renege, Jarrell, why are you still owing me two lives?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you don't send it away, it only takes me half a minute to kill you. But the person around you is tricky and will extend the time to about two minutes." Jarrell said: "I When you just came out from inside, you didn't do it, and if you just told you more than two minutes, it was your second life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It turned out to be a madman." Evan said: "I can also say that it takes only three seconds to get rid of you. Just let you live, you have given you 100 lives. Why didn't you return?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a gamble, a moment of our determination and strength to the gods." Jarrell said: "If you can't kill you, my life will be only two minutes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees Jarrell continue to make hidden gestures, and he must be planning something. In order to be safe, Siegel reached out and stopped Evan, who was about to charge, and gave him a wink. Evan was puzzled, but he believed that the Master’s arrangement had temporarily abandoned the plan to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel refers to the body of the black man on the ground: "This is fun, are they the same? Use the vows for strength?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't deserve." Jarrell began to move his waist and legs, looking at the two adventurers like a hungry jackal. "It’s a pity that you didn’t rush up. Otherwise, the power given by the gods will be stronger. But it doesn’t matter, I am enough to destroy you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not necessarily." Siegel smiled and took the arrow from the space bag. This is much larger than the kind of ammunition sold by Heim’s lords, and it has 30 pieces of plasma. Such a huge ammunition has affected the user's hand, resulting in the handcuffs only being used by both hands. Siegel calmly replaced the ammunition and began to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
