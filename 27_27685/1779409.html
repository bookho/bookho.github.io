			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lost his way in a place covered in fog. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he is dreaming, but the strange thing is that he can still use magic in his dreams, so this is like the state of deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, the hard granite is paved into the ground, divided into neat pieces with golden stripes, just like the power tower of the Mage Federation. He crouched down and touched the ground with his hand, and a slight numbness was heard from his fingers, as if he had touched the plasma pattern of Nexus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are gray mists around, so you can't see how far the ground can extend. It’s pointless to measure the world of dreams with your feet, so Siegel’s fingers spurt out with a bright lightning bolt and flew into the distance. The fog spread and gathered, and the lightning disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers that he settled in Isaac and then rested in bed early. He remembers the soft goose feather pillow, the comfortable close-fitting lamb wool blanket, and the smell of mosquito repellent scented by the pillow. If he feels carefully, he can still feel the message from the real environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dream is too much like a dream, can be seen at a glance, why should it exist? Siegel’s curiosity is steep and he wants to know what is behind the fog, how this dream came about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and mobilized the power of the element. The whirlwind bulged, forming a wind wall beside him, and all the dense fog was rolled up. Then he mobilized the power of the earth element to break down the tiny dust from the ground and rise with the thick fog. It doesn't take long for the fog in the sky to condense and then fall into the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel recites the spell and lets the rain falling on the ground condense into water. The water element becomes bigger and bigger, and eventually rises to the height of the rain cloud. If it is not in a dream, there will be no such spectacle, and Siegel will not have endless elements of power to mobilize. He realized that the water giant is not balanced and is not the perfect state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He melted the ground granite with fire, re-reduced it into lava, and then tried to integrate it into the giant of water. But the huge energy makes the steam transpiration. The water element can't keep the shape stable, and it is constantly twisting in front of Siegel, and it will collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water element must also have enough energy to balance the power of the lava. Siegel raised his other hand. Use the power of the gas element to condense into lightning, let the clouds of rain in the sky turn into thunderclouds, and slowly stuff them into the water element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning combines with water to create a flammable gas that spans a critical step from water to fire. The four elements began to adapt to each other. Energy exchange is formed from the inside. Water is the most adaptable element. There is a saying that water is the source of life. Just in front of Siegel, the water element began to gradually deviate from the scope of the summoning object, and gradually became independent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is slow, but time does not have much real meaning in a dream. The collection of elements gradually shrinks, but is more solid and stable. Eventually it becomes the same shape as Siegel, but in addition to the head, body and limbs, there are four floating tentacles behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each tentacle represents an element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel went forward and looked at this state carefully. The four tentacles are like the special ability of the spell to specialize in the Master. That is, the spell is summoned in the form of an energy ball and then concentrated. It's just that the collection of elements goes one step further, materializing the pure energy to form a ribbon floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the tentacle by hand does not feel its weight at all. The four elements give the four tentacles a different touch, but they are very soft and docile. When the two ribbons intersect, there is a tiny amount of energy generated from the contacts, accompanied by a different crispness of the pitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing spells requires action, sound, elemental energy, and casting materials. In addition to the material, the elemental tentacles seem to have all the other elements. Siegel is thinking about this problem in a focused way, and the collection of elements suddenly twists his head. Open your eyes. Without a white-eyed, the eyes completely covered in black stared at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a collection of elements that reveal a weird smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Master has a spell. But it is just a human being. The damage that people will suffer, the Master is naturally the same. Unless you become undead, all kinds of emotions, such as greed, thoughts, joy, and fear, will act on the Master as usual, and will not change because of the existence of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to get out of bed, cast magic, and let the house light up again. Everything around it was exactly the same as before going to sleep, except that the incense of the bed was extinguished and the door to the balcony was halfway open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damp and humid air is blowing in through the cracks of the door, full of rain, it seems that the whole sky will cry tomorrow. Siegel pushed the door open, went to the balcony, and entered the night, the mood gradually stabilized. The soldiers patrolling in the city of Mystery patrolled the walls illumined by the torches, and the weapons and the armor collided with each other. The kitchen was already busy, and Siegel saw that Puland had a basket of bread embryos heading to the barn, followed by her smart black dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is covered by the thick clouds of heaven, so it is dull. It is said that such an environment is very uncomfortable for the elf priest. Their power comes from the moon god, naturally more abundant in the moonlight, many high-level spells, such as the resurrection and holy aura, need to be displayed at full moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one in the room, so Siegel still feels more comfortable on the balcony. He couldn't help but think of the collection of elements in the dream. Can such a state be realized in reality? He can't mobilize a lot of elements now, just like in a dream, but he already knows how to achieve a balance between the four elements and form a stable interplay structure, which is already an amazing progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to try to reproduce the dreams. Can the elemental surge of the elves greatly increase the concentration of elements? It’s just that he hasn’t gotten through the circle yet. At present, he can only rely on the gourd painting, and can’t break it down and use only the parts that he needs. The amount of magic needed to lay out the entire array is amazing, and Heim’s own can’t stand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spreads the palm of his hand, letting the power of the four elements gather at the fingertips, and then carries out the fusion and reorganization. Because there is not enough energy to support, a stable cycle cannot be formed, and the aggregate of elements is extinguished only for a moment, like Mars in the furnace. Siegel is not discouraged, but clenches his fists. He already understood how the next division of the division should go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the elemental rune matrix of the City of Mystery sensed the role of transmitting magic and issued an alert to Siegel, the target location of the transmission was The courtyard center downstairs. Because a mage can only be transferred to places he has visited or seen. Across the thick wall, no one can see the courtyard of the castle, so the person who carries the transmission must come to the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved and the defensive staff flew from the bed to his hand. A red ball of light emerges from the top of the staff and then projects a beam of light toward the center of the courtyard. The guards of the castle immediately noticed this change. The bell on the wall was knocked. Siegel applied protective spells to himself and then focused on the changes in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milky white light column emerged from the center of the courtyard and fell out of two figures. Siegel yelled and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf wizard Idis robes still smokes black smoke, and his original pale blond hair has become coke. The embarrassed half-elves apparently had to pull off, and they didn’t even have the strength to put on Mars, but they still clasped the wrist of another person next to them with one hand. Janet squinted, but looked at the dark night sky with no eyes and motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the red light beam, Janet’s lifeless face is presented to Siegel. The mage touched her neck with a trembling hand. The only vibration that can be felt comes from your own wrist. She has no heartbeat, no breathing, and no signs of life still present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a breath and grabbed Idis’s neck and yelled: “What happened! You are not guaranteeing her safety! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf coughed hard and tried to open his eyes. Siegel discovered that one of his eyes had collapsed. The old man tried hard to squeeze a word out of his throat. "We were attacked. You let me down and let me say slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigel Short And breathing intensely. But it seems that no air has entered his lungs, and there has always been a feeling of squatting. He tried his best to release his hand and let Edis fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
