Her global vision is hard to search, but she can't find a clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are in danger, leave, and fight back when you encounter an attack, but don't say what the master is missing!" The magic spacecraft entered the alert state, all weapons Prepare for the attack. She resisted panic and fear and slowly landed on the ground as planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do after I go down? The master does not appear, do you want me to talk to the goblins? Xingsuo immediately rejected this idea, and his own gnome is used to project text, but the words of conversation are unpredictable. Even if the goblin can be put aside, what can the owner's personal safety do? He is a powerful mage, and he has the protection of astral projections, but why do I still feel very worried? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange changes in the magic ship also fell into the eyes of the goblin, and they all speculated what the hovering action meant. Silent Goblin has been thinking about a problem. If the other party's technology is so powerful, why not connect directly with the Goblin through some kind of electronic means, but land on the ground again and again for face-to-face dialogue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is doubt in the heart, this alone is not enough evidence to change the original plan. In the face of enemies like the Zenith, it is impossible to rely on brute force and need to be strategic and thoughtful. Other goblin knows the tactics and knowledge he has mastered, and the result of not understanding is to be eliminated. Only one giant is needed in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are steps, methods, and strategies to achieve a great ideal. In this respect, even aliens are not invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his bodyguard sent a document. With only a slight glance, he could no longer maintain the inscrutable image, but shouted angrily: "Bastard! Bastard! Hit it down and hit it down!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, tried, somehow, unable to aim and intercept. Although the fighter was dispatched. But I am afraid it is too late. The danger will soon come, please leave here!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent goblin angrily screamed in the sky, and then the files in his hand fell heavily on the ground. He did not hesitate to get into the car and leave the original meeting place as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other goblin giants have also received information. After looking at each other, they also left. The information is very simple. I wrote a few words on it: "The leader of a star goblin kingdom announced that he has the strongest weapon in the universe to defeat the Zenith star and has already launched it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether it can hit or hurt the Zenith, the ending is no different. The silent plan of the silent goblin is probably going to continue to be silent in mythology. And he will not forgive the act of a star kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to use the order and logic of the goblin to reach the goal of negotiation. This has to be said to be a very creative move. You almost succeeded." There is only a fingertip distance." Lear pinched his index finger and thumb and swayed in front of his own eyes. "You have made the greatest effort, but all efforts are mortal-level efforts that cannot grasp the essence of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think that as long as the Goblin intelligence is normal They can always let them act according to your ideas, but this is not the case.” Master Lear shook his finger: “At this time we are talking, a great pioneer in a goblin. Also a madman, Your magic spacecraft fired a nuclear bomb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you doing this? Isn’t it time for our world to fight for time?" Siegel yelled. The elemental aggregate wraps around the body, and the structure of all magic spells is cleaned, like pouring hot water on the snow. Since the 骷髅 shape itself has the energy flow of the elemental polymer, it naturally cannot be affected. There is no pain in the inspiration, but this self-destruction can easily make the astral projections lose stability, in other words, death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t torture yourself, Siegel, you failed in the goblin." Lear said: "You are doing things like planning." Then look at the people who succeeded step by step. You are very talented in layout, which also strengthens your ability in magic and spells. The most important thing for the Master is this ability. But you don't understand a truth. That is why a mage who focuses on causality and logic, especially good at planning, also needs to learn prophetic spells. To pursue vague results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's right! The mind is step-by-step, but the human heart is unpredictable. You can't think of a goblin that can be arrogant, crazy, deceive yourself, without reason, without a bottom line, without principles. Your plan package Nothing to do with this element of reality, but only prophecy can understand everything. I just need to whisper a few words, so the nuclear bomb will be launched to your spaceship. Everything you do - as I said - It’s just a gorgeous castle on the beach.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are a despicable bastard, Lear! What good is this for you?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy of the Master’s eyes stunned. Smiling and said to Siegel: "Aha, you still don't understand it until now. I want to be like you, but it is just to let things run according to my ideas. It's as simple as that. Our only two differences are nothing more than The method of selection is different, and I have the ability to remove this stumbling block."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I could have ended this war! I can avoid countless innocents. Sacrifice!" Siegel raised his hand, and lightning and flames sprang from his palm. The huge energy is enough to ignite the steel and melt the rocks, but it stops in front of Lear. The spell is broken down and the fluctuations of the element are completely still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an advanced application of the anti-magic field, just like the armor effect of the Royal Guardian of the Starry Kingdom, the external area is anti-magic but does not affect itself. Although in this case the following foreign spells can't be displayed, it does not affect his ability to cast only those spells that only apply to himself, which has given him a great battlefield advantage. However, Lear did not choose to cast spells, but he continued to tell Siegel all the way: "Don't be excited, young people, you just lost this time. There are still many opportunities in the future. You will gradually learn a truth, that is In the end, all the wizards will obey my will and thoughts. You have completely misunderstood the focus. This war is not important at all. Is it difficult to end him? The goblins have enough power to destroy themselves, just need to gently push history. The process, they will do the work for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees that the attack magic has no effect, so he focuses on clearing the spell of space blockade. This legendary spell designed by Leal for Siegel is like a skeleton, very difficult to clean, always re-emerged from unobtrusive places. Fortunately, the method of completely immersing it in the elemental polymer works. After a lot of work, Siegel has regained the ability to transmit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To leave, Siegel, see you later. Welcome to the city to be a guest, bring Evan's nephew and your nephew, we both You can say the wine." Lear said: "I don't know how to use prophecy. I know that day will come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! You don't have reason for prophecy Is this kind of spell not predicting me at all?” Siegel snorted: “Don’t think that you won this time, you’re just destroying one of my plans. What you can’t think of in the future is that You will fail after all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lil’s lips moved and his eyes glowed with excitement: "I like people who are determined and courageous, I Like your fighting spirit! You can be the best mage, the most proud of the magical gods! Come on Siegel, let the horse come over! You know that I will not let you go, even if you have the door to the outside world I can't show my palm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, the sky in the north is bright, the light cage The horizon, everything lost its color. After a dozen seconds, the scene there was restored: the rising black mushroom cloud covered the sky, like the dirty stains on the white clothes. The goblin was once again destroyed with nuclear weapons, but this time, except for one goblin, no one would believe that the attack would work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no problem with the star number, but there is no Siegel spell, she can't transmit. The goblin's nuclear bomb is very magically close to her, avoiding the global vision and then detonating - this is not something that Goblin technology can do on its own. The star saw only the flash, and then returned to the astral of the dark blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille looked at the mushroom cloud in the north and said in awe-inspiring tone: "The weapon of the goblin has a sense of destruction, and every time I see this spectacular sight, I am I feel very shocked. Siegel, I will not leave you, you are still going home. The goblin does not have to worry about you, the Masters Association and the City will prepare a victory for His Majesty the King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say a word, but squeezed his fist. Lear is a bad enemy. He has a clear goal, high mana and excellent means. In order to be able to study the secrets of the blind man, he can give up the power of the powerful godhead, which is incredible. After several months of research and thinking, Siegel counted the goblin and accurately caught a glimmer of hope, and it was necessary to build a bridge of negotiation. Lear took part in this time, secretly stole his foot and stumbled Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
