			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not dare to move, just changed a few breaths at this time. Quietly waiting for the above battle to separate the results, he did not wait too long, he saw a face full of blood mages, ran downstairs, his robe torn, and the shoes were lost, However, he is holding a book with a golden cover, which is the "Magic Construction Research" that was thrown away by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was seriously injured, his nose was gone, and he was constantly licking his blood. But he doesn't seem to care, just want to escape from this place as soon as possible. Siegel watched him leave the Rubik's Cube room and summoned a gray-white ghost horse, quickly disappearing into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, one person walked down and he had two long sticks in his hand. The man licked one eye, his face pale and his feet vain. He stood at the gate and looked in vain in the darkness, where there was nothing. Then he shouted: "You go to please the sorcerer! This folding fortress is mine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he also went out, the door of the Rubik's Cube Closed behind him. He stood outside the square building, set his staff aside, and reached out to touch the door, chanting spell spells that analyzed magic items. A silver-white illuminating pattern appeared on the door, and gradually climbed the entire cube like the crystallization of the spread. The magician's nose was sweating, and the whole body trembled, and he spent his effort to maintain this magical effect. Finally, the light of the spell covered the entire Rubik's Cube, and the way to operate this folding fortress appeared in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician then recites the secret language. The three-story building trembled twice and quickly shrank, turning it into a square metal block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! Space folding fortress, and a huge treasure. This task is really worth it." He put the folding fortress in his pocket and put the original inside. The coins placed are thrown away. Although he has a small space bag, the folding fortress uses the power of space spells when it is shrunk, and such spells are highly exclusive and cannot be opened or continue to fold in the folded space, otherwise a magical energy explosion will occur. He moved his pockets behind him and tried not to let it get noticed. Then he circumvented the huge skeleton, the light of the scepter illuminates, and the original way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel in the Rubik's Cube does not know what happened, and there is no change from his perspective. So he waited for a while and decided that there was no sound before he came out of hiding. Siegel carefully climbed to the top and found that the third magician was dead - the body was pulled into four pieces and it was naturally dead. His staff was on the side, frozen by the ice, and the stick could not stand the cold and cracked. The books on the bookshelf were knocked down, and all the furniture, including the sofa and the bed, were smashed and turned into pieces lying in the corner. Siegel carefully looked through the man's body in accordance with the teachings of Sir Bill. He found an identity nameplate: "Frank-Privilege Sorcerer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May you rest in peace, poor fellow." Siegel put the sign on the man, and then licked his eyes that were not eye-catching. "I went outside to dig a hole for you, how about burying you with that huge skeleton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel went to the bottom and was ready to leave . At this time, he found that the door was closed tightly and could not be opened at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the building has four entrances from the outside, there is only one door from the inside to go out. After trying various methods such as pushing, pulling, and tapping, Siegel determined that he was trapped inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I do?" He scratched his head. Sir Bill has taught him that when he is in trouble, he needs to use all the resources around him. He slaps his head and secretly becomes stupid. The third floor of the building is clearly a living area, and there is something there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, his mood is much better, and stepping on the stairs again in a minor tone. Before the lighting rod burned, he found and ignited the candle, looked at the food and drinking water, and stacked the things that could be used to cook the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The province can eat for a few years, I donâ€™t know if the original owner prepared so much to dry up. The next moonless night is three years later, I don't know if I can stick to that time. In order to be safe, I can't continue to exercise martial arts, but also carefully plan food intake." The more activities, the more you consume, Siegel understands these simple truths. "If those guys from Knox can successfully destroy the stone statues, maybe they will reopen the door soon. How will they deal with me, they won't leave me alive? Or forget it, it's best not to happen that way. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he moved all the books to the side of the bed frame, leaning against the mattress that was devastated by lightning and ice, and began to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the cave, the harassment of Elinte, Leah and Dio had been forced to end, and the three of them were suppressed and could not get close to the camp. Of course, the Knox Association also paid a lot of money. Looking at the night, several people raided the camp. The cremation pile was slashed by Eileen, and the magic of the hoe was completely dissipated. Only one tent was left in the camp, and the rest had been burned by the barbarians. Fifteen bodies were on the scene of the fire, and many of them were shot by the elf feathers and passed through the eye sockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several people underestimated the ability of the caster. The four Knox sorcerers survived after the attack, standing in the camp and guarding the only remaining tents. Due to the existence of this tent, they still have a vortex flag to use. With the help of this magical item, the sorcerers can turn the corpse on the ground into a sorcerer's scorpion, an undead creature between zombies and ghouls. And the caster is very embarrassed, not letting the Witch spirits move, hiding them in the fallen body and becoming a trap to detect the living things. In the second harassment, Dio ambushed, was attacked and lost his left ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene was also injured, a lightning beam hit his knee, causing a serious fracture, and announced that their harassment plan failed completely. Dio glared at the dwarf and forced the reluctant warrior to leave the battlefield. The dwarf is very angry, claiming that even if he is a leg, he must continue to attack and kill those "devils who use magic." Leah was so angry that she dwarfed her beard and deliberately said, "If you dare to rush, we will follow you and die on the road of assault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This brought the dwarf back to the shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea inspected the wounds of Irene, and applied the healing techniques after dyeing. The dwarf's knees are not bleeding, and the bruises are a lot less, but they are still completely unbearable. "You are estimated to be lame, Elinette, and Dio has an ear in this life." The elf said with apologetic: "Unless you can find the high priest, it is possible to revert to the original state. I can't do anything about it now." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, one ear does not affect listening." Dio did not care, still shaking his head: "And the woman doesn't care if I have a few ears." - She won't count!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf screamed twice, and it was a joke to the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, only Lia can also cause harassment, and her bow and arrow is the biggest threat to the caster in the camp. But the elves did not bring too many arrows, and there are only more than twenty left. When several people set off, they never thought about enemies who would encounter a whole camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves now basically lose their mobility, and the elves still have to harass, so only the plateau can leave the battlefield, and will look at the bow in the tower before the arrows are used up. And the ammunition was all moved in. He did not dare to ignite the torch. He could only run down the hill and use the strong body to survive the impact of falling and rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel's security is up to you, Leah." The dwarf shouted: "Hold them as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is deadlocked and turned into an archer against four sorcerers and more than twenty crickets. Before Dio came back, the frequency of Leah's archery could only be suppressed to a minimum, so three sorcerers would enter the cave, find the Rubik's cube building, and then trap Siegel inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a battle, except for the dead in the Rubik's Cube, the sorcerer with the golden book flew away on the phantom horse mount, leaving only the two casters None of this spell will still be trapped in the camp. The guy who blinked his eyes was exhausted, hiding in the tent and trying to heal the wounds, trying to restore his fighting ability as soon as possible. The poor egg that was not harvested was very reluctant to be a target, so I used six shackles to surround myself in the middle to prevent the bow and arrow from being attacked by the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing, the moonless night is about to pass. The dwarf was anxious, but did not dare to let the elf go to the hole to see - because there is no special vision, he does not know that the gimmick described by Siegel is still absent, naturally not afraid to take risks. He thought about it, then shouted: "The people inside listened and surrendered! This is the territory of the gem clan dwarf of Mora, and your actions have violated the rights of the dwarven kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two casters looked at each other, and the one-eyed sorcerer replied: "We have not seen any signs of the dwarf territory, here is the unclaimed area that can be explored!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
