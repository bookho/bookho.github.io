			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​the death knight was unsuccessful. Suddenly he heard a violent pumping sound behind him, and then the heart began to beat again. 'how come? It thinks in my heart. Then a fierce impact struck from its back, the armor was penetrated, and the cold cold exploded from the inside of the armor, seriously damaging its source of power - soul fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight is extremely angry. It uses a full force to make a very sharp call. All listeners’ ears immediately flow out of blood, and Siegel is no exception. He only felt dizzy, everything around him was spinning, and it was difficult to maintain balance. In the lingering light of his eyes, he saw a machete attacking himself. If he did not respond, he would soon cut himself off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Siegel loosened the rifle, a slab bridge, to avoid the crossbow of the machete. He lost his weapon again, but Siegel still had no fear - he had already suffered a blow to death, so nothing could crush him. Between the electric and the flint, Siegel condenses the magic of the whole body, and all of it is poured into the wand, and the energy burst ball is displayed. The purple ball of light hits the eye of the death knight accurately. After the roaring explosion, the knight swayed and stepped back a few steps, but it didn't matter. This spell was suppressed by the death knight's soul fire and did not cause substantial damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think you are a powerful mage, can you hurt me?" The death knight is stuck with a cold ice gun, but the sound is still cold and terrible. "You have only enough ability to scratch me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a lot of nonsense." Siegel's murderous and fighting spirit is not diminished, screaming Kung Fu, so that all efforts were made to cast a dagger. The energy burst ball once broke the eater's neck, how could it be ineffective? There is no death knight, but the face is blown open and a dagger is enough for the dagger to fly in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obsidian's dagger penetrated into the darkness of the helmet and accurately hit the soul of the soul. The helmet was blown into pieces in a loud bang, and the gray-green venom was shot. The venom and the shards of the helmet began to burn together in midair, smoky black smoke, and sounded like a deep fried ziz. Then the death knight's body armor slammed on the ground, part of the arm fell from the shoulder, and then the breastplate with the ice gun was rolled off the ground from the belt. The last black smoke rose from the empty armor and dissipated in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swayed and stood still. He relied on the magical resistance of the twenty-faced scorpion to escape the mastery of death, but it also cost the whole body. He is like a hapless person who has not eaten, drunk, or slept for three days and three nights. He is almost out of consciousness. Reluctantly supported, he took out a bottle of dwarf's therapeutic potion from his pocket and rushed to drink it, injecting energy into the body that was about to dry up. The dwarf gold belt also played a role, extending the time when Siegel was injured and not letting him get a chance to get treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical exertion can be overcome, the wound can heal, but the pain in the heart is difficult to recover. Siegel looked at the burning camp, the tallest tent was still braving the flames, and he finally had a chance to shed tears. Through this layer of water mist, he saw the flame swaying and swaying, like a giant waving at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Giant? ‘Siegel’s sigh, squeezed his eyes and let the tears flow away quickly, and then he saw it clearly. He saw that Kerry, who was covered in ice crystals, tore up the camp, and the flame burned on his head and shoulders, braving black smoke. Kerry was burnt and grinned, but he resisted. Because under his arms, three people are protected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunchback wizard, the kitten Janet and the black wolf Princess Mesera. Siegel looked at it again, and a baby with a small arm and a calf was hidden in the arms of Mesera. No matter how much he couldn't see it, because the tears couldn't stop flowing, and all the sights were taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the dragon and the dragon is also divided. The red is at a disadvantage from the beginning because of the injury, and it is very difficult to attack the vulnerable. , defeated. Its neck was twisted, the skull was penetrated, and the body was pressed under the green dragon, and the breathing had stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon came to Siegel, and the wings, shoulders and chest and abdomen continued to drop blood, which was caused by the claws and tail of the red dragon. Siegel suddenly realized that if he left the camp with the transsexuals, then Kerry would be drowned by the fire after he came out of the camp and died in the mouth of the Red Dragon. Only when fighting in the end, won this line of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon stopped in front of Siegel, bowed his head and said in a heart voice: "Remember, you owe me once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You owe me once." The voice of the easy-to-shape person became very serious and repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, then the green dragon flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire burned all night, the black smoke straight up the sky, and even the sun's rays were covered. Fortunately, the rain fell over the grassland shortly after, which extinguished the anger of the dragon. At the same time that the last flame was extinguished, the rain in the sky stopped immediately, the clouds dispersed, and a rainbow hung in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost horses are coming back one after another, and there are some cattle and sheep that know the way. The people of the Jackdaw tribe swear to thank the animals who are willing to tide over them, and will treat them well, only taking milk and hair, not taking their flesh. Perhaps this oath was appreciated by the Spirit of Nature. They found a cellar that was not burned. The grain inside was mostly soaked in water, but it was still enough for them to spend the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, their people have suffered too much death and injury, and they have not used so much food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survivors deplore the dead relatives and cry to the ruined homeland and grain fields. They are almost desperate to destroy the family, and it is already fortunate that they can escape their lives. The women and children hiding from the cellar returned to the ground and they looked around for their loved ones. Whenever they find their familiar figure, they will cry together and hold together. The body of the dragon is now lying in the middle of the camp, and several daring crows have overcome the horrible deterrent of the dragon and landed on the body. They use their mouths to beat the scales of the dragons in vain, making a creaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon’s body is next to the armor left by the death knight, which has been scattered into pieces and skewed to the ground. The surrounding grass is affected by the dead spirits remaining on it, and it has been ruined and turned into gray. The ice-cold gun is not far away, and it is constantly radiating cold cold, and no one can approach it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fell not far away, lying on Janet’s lap and screaming. His body was covered with finely broken wounds, and there was a dent in the shape of the palm on the breastplate. But this did not affect his sleep - he was exhausted to the extreme, did not want to move, even breathing is light and slow. The kitten held a half tent and blocked the rain for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about everything that has been experienced, Janet still has a lingering fear. The cries are mixed with the burning sound of the flames, but they are not as good as the screams of Mesella. His child chose to be born at this time, making the scene very chaotic. The sorcerer uses the potion and spell to help the mother produce, and Janet holds the blanket and is ready to catch the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refueling, Mesera." Janet only remembered saying this: "You will be a good mother, this will be a good boy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flame over the entire tent, but fortunately the wizard responded quickly, blocking the burning of the first wave of dragon inflammation with a magical energy barrier. How can the red dragon's flame be so easily resisted? They are trapped in tents, the barriers are crumbling, and high temperatures and suffocation can take their lives at any time. At this time, Kerry rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Giant’s lineage erupted under the intense emotions of the giants, and a chilling force helped the magic barrier, allowing him to breathe. Kerry finally saw the Mesera, and the Black Wolf Princess finally saw the giant, and then accompanied by a cry, the crystallization of their love was finally born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was the first person to hold a baby. The wizard took the child, cut the umbilical cord, and then returned to look at the child's ears and limbs. "Everything is fine, this is a good boy." The wizard handed the child to the mother and then turned to Kerry and said, "I need your blood to let everyone rush out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The giant has stretched his arm and his eyes have been gazing at the mother and child. That is the only thing he should pay attention to. His blood flowed from his wrist, caught by the wizard, and slammed into the air, turning into a whirlwind of ice and snow. The affairs of the department are different from what the wizard expected. The flames still burned down, and even used the magic barrier as fuel, vowing to turn the people inside into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Kerry made a desperate attempt to use his own ** as a shield for siege, to protect other people, and to come out of the flames. His scalp and shoulders were ignited, and his flesh and blood were burned. He succeeded in protecting everyone from coming out, but his head and arms were burned and he was being treated by a wizard. The Messiah tried to put out the flames with his hands, and burned his arms, just like her husband, obediently obedient. The children ignored the noise around them and slept quietly between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
