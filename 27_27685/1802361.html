			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Siegel saw the wiki, the intelligence chief of the starry kingdom, a middle-aged man with outstanding looks and white hair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the first impression, the wiki looks more like a bohemian, often the haunted master of the court dance, or is a recreation poet. His slightly old appearance did not make him lose his appeal, but increased his charm, especially for young women, who could satisfy their diverse preferences at the same time. His eyes are always difficult to focus on, you can't grasp what direction he is paying attention to, or he is always looking at all directions. Even before the king's squat, the wiki is a side-by-side ceremony, while taking in all the corners of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Marquis of Siegel Squid, the new military general of the Imperial Council. Wiki, the intelligence director." Evan's introduction is very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wiki, is this the full name?" Siegel asked immediately when he had questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The villain has no surname, Mr. Marquis, only the wiki. In fact, my parents are probably the biggest secret in the world, I spent thirty The year of search did not get an answer." His voice was hoarse and unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After finding it?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Depends on..." The wiki squinted at the king and the Marquis and said, "Depends on the reason they abandoned me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't discuss this topic," the illegitimate king of the past twenty years and the same marquis without parents are really not suitable to continue to listen to this topic, so Evan said: "I You need a hunting dog to get ready for the rescue. You go to find the three children's intimate clothes, which is best. Is there a portrait of them in the parrot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you can do it in an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will hand you over to the Marquis of Siegel, and I will know later. Let him know. Have you not been financially tight all the time? I have handed the richest people in the whole continent to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Siegel The Marquis is not the richest," Vicky's hoarse voice continues: "He is the most profitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of 200 million gold coins is still circulating between mercenaries and adventurers, and it is more and more vivid. Just like real. In fact, the treasury of Heim’s collar began to slowly accumulate after the completion of the star sling, but it has not been able to cover the floor. And even if Siegel didn't build a magical spaceship, there shouldn't be that much money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wiki received the order, he turned and left, and the action was very simple. After the door is closed. Siegel asked: "Can this person trust?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avin nodded, then picked up a piece of cake from the side of the plate and ate it. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the King still trusts him very much, otherwise he will not pick up things in a room where a spy head has been alone. In addition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the military chief, and the intelligence chief, the Duke of Carlyle, who is in charge of royal affairs. The Marquis of Mottley Clive, who is in charge of foreign affairs, and the Baron of Construction, Norris Nelson, formed the former parliament. "Lee Master, as a consultant to the school city, did not attend the parliament and directly spoke to me. The Aurora High Priest of the Temple of Dawn sometimes went to the Imperial Parliament to listen, but he did not have the power to make a statement, and at most it bothered me. "Evan uses a juice to gargle, and seems to figure out what to say: "This way, it seems that I am serving the pre-conference meeting. You said, I am the king, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not. Anyway." Siegel rolled his eyes. Shrugging shoulders expressed helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can continue to talk back now, not bad." Evan wiped his mouth and walked to the big table in the middle of the "strategic room" and put it on top. The cloth was taken away. A beautiful map of the kingdom of stars is carved on the bronze tabletop, and the terrain of the mountains and rivers is vividly made. As a logo of the castle, some small flags made of magnets can be painted with the badges of each family. The fineness of this map is not far from William's map, but it should be more accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Star Fort is not the flag of the magnet, but the bronze medal of the starry kingdom, symbolizing that the king will never die. In the place where the Star Fort is more than 2,700 miles east, a yellow flag marked "Gnomes" is unusually eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I work hard." Siegel nodded. He looked at the flag of the goblin. I was thinking about a dialogue with Lear in another world. After hesitating for a while, he decided to take it out to Evan. About the true strength of the earth, the military and political form of the goblin, the situation in which they confronted them, and the facts that were destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nuclear weapons are equivalent to the legendary spell of the Master, or the power is quite amazing. If it is destructive, I think even the Holy One of God of War. It's not as powerful as a nuclear bomb, and this kind of weapon can be produced in batches.” Siegel sighed: “If there is no magic, or no power of rules, no one can survive under that kind of blow. The only good The news is that the goblin is temporarily unable to pass, otherwise, in addition to a few powerful casters, more knights are also difficult to fight against the number and firepower of the goblin. If it is not astral projection, I would not dare to confront them. Nuclear bombs are consumables, but they are not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Siegel’s story also omits many situations that do not require Evan to know, such as stars. The cable number is a smart magic creature, a virtual cannon and an array of electromagnetic guns, a wide range of peaceful arrays and a furious array. These things will only make the king distracted, but will ignore the more critical facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that the school has submitted a detailed report to me, roughly the same." Evan gently patted the bronze map, worried Authentic, "I already know that what you said before is true, so I will give this matter to you completely. If you only use the intelligence of the past to carry out this war, isn't it similar to the blind? Their The news is too late, almost no reference value, and only you can have one to say one! But as you mentioned earlier, it is not impossible to destroy the goblin, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and it would not be cruel to add some hope at this time. "The goblin has not found a way to continue to maintain the situation that we can only fight them. The victory is only a matter of time. Now it is the saints who can ensure that the goblin is blocked, but the human beings do not have the saints in this respect. Can God help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan smiled bitterly: "I am the saint of the morning god, the name is not capable. The only The advantage is that it is very difficult to be hacked, but let me resist the goblin, I have no choice - except for the sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two saints are basically impossible, and even the opening can be saved. The rest of the Temple of War, if there is a Holy One, may have been beaten long ago, not enough to clean up the chaos. The Mother Earth Temple has never been to the Holy One, and their pastors have used a great deal of divine power to heal the sick, regulate the weather, and promote the harvest. I am afraid there is not much left. But the Mother Earth Temple is worth asking for, maybe there will be a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "School City said that the Elf and the Masters Association has a plan in progress, and once went to the library of the school city to check the information, and may soon be released." Evan told him: "You have to check this plan for me, I trust your wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position is not a good job, It’s never been, but Siegel’s influence on the situation at the military commander’s position is better than that of Heim’s lord. He stood at the table, staring at the bronze map, and Evan sat on one side and ate his own snacks. Although I haven't solved any problems yet, Evan suddenly feels a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the wiki came back with a big step. He is very fast, but he has no sweat on his head. Obviously his physical fitness and martial arts are very good. Then his loud footsteps are deliberately made? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, Marquis, the hound is ready, just waiting in the outer hall." He untied a cloth parcel from behind, "There are three babies inside." Something, for insurance, no one has touched it directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your care." Siegel said to Evan: "You Going to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I rarely see you casting spells, just open your eyes." Avon is very interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entire palace is forbidden to fly, stealth and send spells. Is there any place for me to cast spells? I don't want to forcefully destroy your magical array here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forcibly destroy, wow, can you do that?!" Evan suddenly became more excited. The wiki coughed a bit and made the king squat back: "I will show you the forced part later. I will take you to a place where you can cast spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
