			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no other help, Siegel will die in the woods next to the kobold camp, just like Sir James on a knight. Growing up, it has passed away. However, the 20-faced scorpion hanging on the chest of Siegel exudes a very faint radiance. The long-lived stored energy flows through it, penetrates into his body, and is scattered in the wound hit by the force field missile. This force shackled Siegel, let him move, can not move, stiffly lying on the ground, can not even say anything, can only silently bear the pain of the flesh being grilled by high heat. The wound exuded a scorching smell, but it healed quickly, and eventually there was no trace of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes are very satisfied with the effects of their spells. He looks at Siegel’s motionless body and thinks that he has completely killed this uncomfortable hapless. . Now is the time to receive the spoils, and the knight has not yet returned, just a simple spell can make the black horses change their masters, obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly past Siegel’s "corpse", holding a powder with a fascinating effect in his hand, feeling that he was winning. At this time, the "corpse" suddenly shook a bit, and the caster looked down and found a pair of black eyes staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still no..." The robes only said half a nonsense in surprise, he opened the long stick, the two palms were opposite, ten fingers Open, presented as a fan-shaped fan, aiming at the Siegel on the ground. There is a word in his mouth, and a bright red flame flower is appearing in his palm. When he finished the spell, the flower would bloom completely, and the cone-shaped flame that turned into a jet burned the enemy nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also held the ropes used to tie the feed pockets. He instinctively pulled the rope up and used the technique of binding the sails on the mast. . The rope turned two turns and the rope head came back to form a perfect knot, which immediately tied the caster's two wrists. He pulled it hard and the rope tightened immediately, causing the two wrists to stagger and make a squeaky sound. The caster screamed, and the flames of the palms disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s legs slammed into the robes of the men’s laps and slid away from the ground full of beans. He used his waist and abdomen to turn back, and he was as strong as a monkey. Now that the situation has reversed, Siegel is half-squatting on the ground, and his hand is the sickle he uses for his work. The caster fell to the ground in pain, and his hands were tied tightly by the ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Battle is a matter of life and death." Sir Bill taught his followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sickle, Siegel jumped up from the ground and shouted to the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one spell time." The robes measured the pros and cons of offense and defense, and then chose a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope in his hand twisted and grew scales, turning into a thick, long snake. The poisonous snake raised his head. Two apricot-yellow eyes on the inverted triangle's head stared fiercely at Siegel, vomiting a snake letter, and a pair of fangs hung with green droplets. The robes liberated their hands, and they stood up and took a word in their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ropes that have changed from the ropes are between Siegel and the robes, and they are curled up and ready to attack. Siegel knew that he had no turning back, only to resist the fear, clench his teeth, and erupted a stubborn sigh. He leaped hard, skipped from the snake's head, and slammed the sickle toward the chest of the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the waving of the sickle, Siegel closed his eyes nervously. This is his first real life-and-death struggle. The part of human nature is good. Do not like to take the same life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, a warm liquid splashed on the face of the squid, causing him to open his eyes. He saw the caster kneeling on the floor, with a sickle in his neck, blood flowing along his chin and shoulders—the energy of life was eternal with blood. The man struggled a few times, took out a few mouthfuls of blood, and then fell to the ground. His wrists are still tightly tied by the ropes, and there are no poisonous snakes around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel would like to fall down on the ground and take a breather to rest, but he was afraid that the robes would come alive and kill themselves. ‘Come on, squid, you have to act quickly. He cheered himself, restrained the shaking legs, and picked up the branches of the ground and threw them at the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person does not move, the blood does not flow, it seems to die. Siegel still did not trust, ran back to the war horse, found the short sword seized from the kobold, and carefully leaned up. He slashed the finger of the man with a sword - no one can endure such pain. The body still remained motionless, and Siegel was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a backpack behind the robe, and there are a lot of strange things inside: the bones of several birds, a box of plant roots, a suspicious vial of various color liquids, a few days of dry food and drinking water. , large rolls of paper, ink and feather pens, and a few thin books: one of them was locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sleeves of the robes, one side is a powder bag, and the other side is hidden with a dagger, but unfortunately this person has no time to use it. Siegel found a wallet on the man's belt, which was beautifully decorated with 21 gold coins, eight silver coins and two rubies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will not value the gems, only guessing that this thing is worthwhile. According to Sir Bill and his agreement, as a knight, you can get one-twentieth of the total income of the knight. So at least one of these coins will be the property of Siegel. The young people feel that the trenches they are looking forward to are getting closer, and they are very excited. He put these spoils aside and saw the soft boots on the caster's feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill’s black clothes returned to the camp like a shadow. In addition to a few sharks who are not worth pursuing, the lakeside camp has been demolished, and there will be no more robbers in a short time. When the jazz came back, I saw the horses that were screaming and sleeping. I was a little surprised, so I walked through the last few trees. He saw a human corpse in a robes on the open ground, and Siegel was facing his own, slamming the boots of the corpse with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to take the opportunity to observe the young man and see what he would do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why are you hiding a key here? Don’t you feel uncomfortable walking?" He puts these things aside and then puts them on their hands. The eyelids of the deceased. "I have only seen the funeral of the sailors. It is to bind them to the sea and sink them into the sea, let the sea gods take their souls. It is too far from the sea, and I think the sea gods will not like you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought about it and said, "I don't know who your God is, but I hope he can protect you and return your soul to the kingdom of God." Don't remember to hate me, even though I ended your life, but it is only for self-defense, and self-defense is my power. I don't know what kind of funeral you are used to, so I will dig a pit to bury you and give you A tombstone. I don't know your name, I have to write a handsome bald on the tombstone. I think this should be enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he stood up Come, get ready to go to the backpack and find the shovel. At this moment, he found that Sir Bill stood beside the horse, with his arms around, his mouth shaking, his face looking strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...ah...this person suddenly jumped out to beat me, so I had to fight back..." Siegel explained quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you just got a fight, then won?" The jazz changed back to a serious and cold expression, shouting loudly: "I walked so long. Time, you are not aware of it at all. What if I want to be an enemy, if there are still bad people hiding and preparing to start? Do you want to know how to die? You are a clumsy, looking for loot, one "The greed of the goblin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...I..." Siegel yelled twice and replied earnestly: "Sorry, sir, I I know it is wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and take the long rod on the ground, let me see where this guy came from."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was busy running to the side, picking up the wooden stick from the middle of the leaves and black beans. The tip of the pole is thick, more than one meter long, lighter than imagined. There are many roots twisted and twisted, and they are grabbed together. Siegel's long stick is very surprised by its weight. It is always suspected that this thing is just a layer of bark, which may be hollow. He learned the movements of the robes, put the stick on the ground, waved his left hand, and lowered the sound, and he laughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heat flow is drawn from his body and passed along his arm to the long stick. Siegel's legs were soft, and he tried to hold the stick to fall, and a strong sense of exhaustion shrouded the whole body. It felt like he had wiped the deck twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red ball of light floats from the stick and floats quietly in the air, emitting a faint red glow like a burning candle. The knight and his entourage looked at the ball of light in amazement, as if they were a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light ball sways gently, always staying at the top of the long stick. Siegel instinctively felt that the ball of light was not threatened, so he reached out and touched it. The fingers penetrated through the ball of light, neither feeling the body nor feeling the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
