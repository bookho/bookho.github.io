Siegel pointed to the top of his head and said to Evan: "If you can't see How do you get there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t thought so far. At the moment I only know that the goblin is finished, and the dangerous enemies will not be thrown out in the crystal wall passage. My kingdom will no longer be attacked by nuclear bombs, which I have already satisfied." The king crouched down and his fingers could not touch the handle on the waist. "The power of the goblin is indeed terrible. A world can be completely destroyed by force. I have never thought of such a thing before, and I thought that the dragon is the strongest force in the world."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Siegel, and there was a hint of gloom in his eyes: "Siegel, the Master is constantly developing and constantly improving, and finally their power can destroy the world like a goblin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where is the use of nuclear bombs to destroy the world?” Siegel shook his head. “It’s too slow, too inefficient. Take the magic array in front of us. Let's say, the power to ban a rule. The deflagration and high temperature are currently banned. If it changes, the flow of air is banned, and everyone will be killed in a few minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Avon's face changed, only feeling cold in his hands and feet. In the process of starting the magical array, he and the legendary spells swayed the world and felt almost endless energy. His soul is separated from the body's shackles and goes straight into the sky, overlooking thousands of creatures. It seems to be the feeling of God, a feeling of omnipotence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only excitement and excitement at the time, but I was very scared when I turned around. All of this power comes from the legendary law of the Masters Association and has nothing to do with himself. If you change someone, he will have the same feelings as himself. As Siegel said, what happens if another rule is changed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Majesty, please don't listen to the Siegel Master's alarmist." Lear copied his hands in his sleeve and slowly came over. "The ban is not a simple matter. Only the magic genius is not enough. It also requires the power above the level of the Holy One. Not all creatures can bear the baptism of the rule. If I stand in your position, After the launch, the array will be directly disintegrated. There are so many saints in the world. No one will try to destroy the world. This legendary squad is kept here at the Masters Association and will never fall into the hands of madmen, so the world is safe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at Lear and tried to see his inner thoughts in his eyes. Lear also has the same plan. So the two sergeants looked at each other with the same calm and waveless eyes until Evan broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I remember correctly, the two of you will meet for the first time on a stone boat. The two organizations of your two representatives are opposite each other. The security and stability of the kingdom has caused very bad influence. Now that the problem of the goblin has been basically solved, it is time to get to both of you. Let me talk about it. What kind of thoughts are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear regained his gaze and said a little to Evan, then said: "Siegel is the leader of the young mage and has made amazing achievements. The future will definitely be his, I can only avoid I am already focused on the association, and I will not worry about the matter after studying the city. If you don’t take time to study, I am afraid that we will soon be overtaken.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is a way to dispel your worries, Master Lear." Siegel said with a smile: "It is not a difficult thing to recover youth now. I only need a little bit of flesh and blood to send you. a young body. Three months to four months later. You are also young. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cloning?" Lear shook his head. "I don't believe this spell can be as magical as you claim, against the laws of life, Beyond the boundaries between life and death, this is a very dangerous and irresponsible move. Your spell must have hidden dangers that have not yet been exposed, and those who have been cloned and resurrected face a very serious threat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your level stays on the conclusions only by imagination, then it is really your identity as a teacher. I sincerely invite you to join the experiment of cloning, even if you encounter anything. Hidden dangers, find ways to overcome it. I will accept them forty-four thousand gold coins. For Lear Master, I only accept one gold coin symbolically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lear still shook his head and was unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the King. I have shown goodwill." Siegel extended his right hand and gestured. "Master Lear, what you want from me has never belonged to you. If you have a little shame, you know that the starting point of the whole thing is a slap in the face. I know that you will not stop, I also It’s impossible to pin your hopes on your concessions. You want to find me, even if you come over, don’t pull in others. Since the King’s Majesty said that let’s not let the two kingdoms affect the stability of the kingdom, then shake hands with me, then Go out to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched over the old, dry, knuckles and clasped hands with Siegel. The surface of his skin is covered by a thin field of force, so there is actually no real contact. The same is true for Siegel, the film-glued structure of the elemental polymer structure avoids the contact between him and Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of your students followed me a few days ago and was caught by me." Siegel pulled Lear slightly in his direction, smiling. Said: "He has no problem except for being eternal. I think you definitely want him to go back, so I will return it to you in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for the care of the Marquis." Lear wanted to take his hand back, only to find that Siegel’s fingers were clenched like pliers. He shivered quietly, but was still forced to hold with Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled slightly, meditating on the greasy spell, trying to make his hand slippery and then take it out. However, Siegel mobilized the elements to destroy, and the spell has been dispelled before it has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting." Lear’s fingers shook slightly, giving off the power of lightning, trying to paralyze the Siegel fingers. However, the electric spark just appeared, it was quickly guided, and the body of Siegel entered the earth, and it could not touch the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Lear’s hand slammed quickly, and there were almost a hundred in a second. "What kind of spell is this, what is the inventor thinking about?" Siegel laughed, and the slap in the face was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was laughing, he didn’t relax at all. The combination of the earth element and the water element strength, temporarily created into a viscose-like effect, no matter how Lear shakes, can not break away. The old Master’s face has already appeared impatient, what is the use of this young man’s tricks, can you prove anything? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Evan and the King’s kneeling at this time noticed something wrong, but it seems that he did not know that the two men were fighting in the palm of their hands. He didn't want to continue playing, so he began to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn’t even listen to Lear’s spell, it’s definitely a blind eye. According to Lear's level of casting, a spell of spells is spoken in the mouth, but a model of another spell is silently constructed. Such an action is not too difficult. Siegel perceives the flow of qi, and notices a few flashing spell structures, so the opportunity to know that he has finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get rid of the sticky gum, Lear really showed a gasification. He concentrated the power of the spell below his wrist and tried to extract his hand from Siegel's grasp in this way. Even if Siegel smashes the gas hand, it can be reorganized during the gasification process, leaving no real wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grasps the moment when the spell is about to take effect, the fingers are slammed, the power of the four elements gathers at the fingertips, and then concentrates on Leer’s little finger on. The elemental aggregate cuts off Lear's gasification spell, and the entire palm becomes gas, but the little finger still retains its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took advantage of the situation and caught the little finger in his hand. "I know Master Lear, thank you for your support of cloning. With this finger, I will complete the clone training as soon as possible. The body of twenty-four years old can be completed in two and a half weeks."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Lear shook his head. "Siegel, I know you will have some blood magic, but it is impossible to use those magics to deal with me. Even if you have the support of the secret nuclear, you can greatly increase the intensity of the spell, but you have to remember In magic, it is not powerful enough to solve all problems. It is impossible to wear rules that rely on brute force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood magic, you think Where have you been?” Siegel shook his head with a smile. "I have eaten the blood magician's loss very early. I study blood magic for prevention. It is not for harm. If you want to hurt you, I will be in front of you when you are awake with your wand in your hand. "Traditionally cast spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knight spirit, huh?" Lear turned his right hand back to the entity, and his left hand took the wand at the point of the broken finger. The bones, blood vessels, muscles, nerves, and epidermis grow in sequence, and a little finger grows again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Regeneration?" Siegel asked curiously as he placed Lear's finger in the space bag. “How do I not feel the energy fluctuations of a god?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
