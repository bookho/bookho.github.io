			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps only a ghost controlled by a spell can communicate with it normally, and the spell teaches him obedience, love, and trust. These three samples, together with his wealth and a pass to the big city, let the fat goblin survive in front of Siegel, so Siegel spent two seconds asking his name: Gru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For you, my brave bounty hunter, I will go directly to Star City. The quickest way to get there is by plane, or by high-speed train. But you don't have an ID card on your body." The fat goblin used the remaining teeth to chew the mushrooms while saying to the "Taka": "I have already told you to do it for you as soon as possible, so don't worry, I will accompany you on the ride." The car, and the time on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No killing Gru is the right choice, Siegel slowly realizes that the earth is a completely different world. . If the frozen snow is regarded as the ridiculous land of the western part of the city wall, then the star city will be more complicated than the eternal eternal tree country. The identity card, bank account and unique communication number replace the complex title and family name and become a symbol of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are divided into four levels: the superior who has the youthful pharmacy, the second-class who uses the pharmacy to serve the superior, and the second-class The third class of service, and the savage without identity. There are three levels between Gru and Taka, so before Gru is never compromised with Taka, he would not have such awareness at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifespan of the goblin is usually only forty years, and the last ten years because of the loss of vitality, can only be considered as a lingering. The youthful medicinal agent can double the life of the goblin and completely eliminate the old age, so that the goblin remains viable. Gru used three youthful pharmacies and possessed another ten potions in his most secret and safest fortress. Only the living Gru can take out the potions, and only the potions can maintain a stable subordinate relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel immediately thought of destroying the youthful potion and destroying the social structure of the goblin, but he soon discovered that it was not feasible. Every goblin country has dozens or even hundreds of pharmaceutical manufacturing points. As long as the corresponding resources are provided, even the savage can possess the pharmacy and become the superior. “It takes twenty young goblins to make a potion.” Gru said: “And a lively Zhuofu can make about thirty potions, which can triple my wealth instantly!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about besides Goblin and Zhuofu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No goblin would ask questions like this, but the spell prevented Gru from producing Any doubt. Even Siegel said that he is a goblin who is as light as a swallow. Walking on the surface of the water, Gru will not hesitate to believe. So no matter how "unreasonable" Siegel's question is, Gru will answer it truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be an intellectual creature, things like pigs and sheep have been proven not to be used to make youthful potions." Gru handed a cup to Siegel sweet wine. I also have a drink full of it, which is a moist throat. The fat goblin has been talking and answering Siegel's questions - he has never said such a long time in his life. “Many animals used to have some intelligence, but they couldn’t keep up with the demand for pharmaceutical production and were naturally eliminated. Isn’t it a pity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. What a pity? Goblin is an adult in the fourth year after birth, and it takes only four months to reproduce the next generation, two to three at a time. This speed is among the best in the "command" race, only slightly slower than the Kobold. It may be the only way to avoid the goblin being "pity". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High birth rates can be used to create youthful potions, while also causing scarcity of youth medicines. Only a handful of goblins can get a potion. Although it is necessary to take one for more than 40 years, the killing between the same kind has been going on. According to the organization method of killing, the goblins established different countries. They developed various weapons and developed them step by step. The most powerful countries can get the most resources, who are trying to raise objections, or prepare for the battle. Or it will become a resource for making medicines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me, Gru. Is there an example of a conflict between the two parties that stopped the conflict and returned to the state before the conflict?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are they stupid?" Gru was funny about the problem and said: "The only thing that can make me sleep is that my enemies have disappeared. Everyone I think so, so no one will stop. Taka, what you said is only in the legend, the era of ignorance and darkness, the era when the goblin is alive like a mouse."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These animals are not much, so hurry to eat." Gru always said: "Only the most powerful and wealthy people can enjoy it. Come to Taka, try it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and sat in the carriage constantly reading. There are all kinds of electrical equipment on the earth, just like the Netherworthy Void Battleship. Using extremely small originals, the goblins have created items that can help with various calculations. And use a "star network" to connect all the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called star god is the star network. Although it is hung by the goblin, it is not a true god. Siegel gradually learned about the world. He has the legend of the creation god. He once had a true belief. He once had a variety of living things to live together. The current goblins have mastered the powerful forces, some of which have already surpassed the limits of nature, and some of them seem to have met each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gru handed a "mobile phone" to Taka, "the only communication number FN-2188", fat goblin said: "Your ID card and bank account number It will be done soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not seen in a dream? In a world of steel and lightning, people are eager to eat poisonous food and contribute to the glowing image in their hands every day. It turns out that everything is true, but it is not a person, but a goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a little confused, he came to his dream, or was it influenced by the world and created a dream? He watched Gru eat raw caviar with thick lips and washed them down with dark brown blueberry wine. Blood-like liquor flows down the corners of the mouth, causing marks on the yellow skin of the goblin. This kind of scene makes Siegel feel nausea, even the two body organs are difficult to suppress the urge to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should rest more and rest, motion sickness is difficult to collect." Fat goblin while watching Taka vomit, while rubbing the grease: "I though I am not strong and flexible, but I am very stable. I live long, see more, think long-term, so you can listen to me right. After the Star City, you follow me, except for the Star Center, you are everywhere else. You can see it. But after the visit, you have to work for me, protect me and remove the inferiors who are trying to step on me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gru's self-talk is nothing more than the effect of the spell. The hint and charm form a complete set of logic in his mind. It is very difficult to get rid of the trap of logic. Gru wants Taka to serve him. This is just his own wishful thinking. It is a pavilion built on fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guru will be immersed in this illusion, doing his dreams over and over again. The power of the spell continues to deepen in the process until the hint becomes a reality. Only when Siegel asks questions, will he call the real power of thinking to answer Siegel's questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, how is the phone connected to the star network when there is no line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "By passing through some kind of electrical signal in the air, I don't understand it." Gru replied casually: "Learning knowledge is something that second-class goblins need to do. Only questions like this can be answered. Wait, I just need to care about domination, management, and find enough materials to make young pharmacy. Unfortunately, I didn't catch that Zhuofu this time. How do you say he died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "He has a gunshot wound, the wound is gone, and even the locusts are not willing to eat him." Siegel did not want to say more about this, and then pulled the topic back to the phone. He learned how to use this tool and knew that there would be a star network connection when approaching the town. In order to capture this signal, he constantly adjusts the sense of elemental fluctuations, and goes deep into meditation again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned his senses into the most sensitive state, he finally "seeed" a new world. Numerous waves travel through the air, forming a vast network that connects all the phones. Through the screen, through the emoji, information, consultation and knowledge are connected to each other, and instantly close the distance between all individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the mind is closer, and the speed at which the goblins and the goblins interact with each other is also invisibly accelerated. An emotion can instantly reach another goblin from a goblin phone, and then quickly infect him, just like a spell effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Association has had research that the speed of emotion spread is related to the distance between two people. The more you don't trust each other, the farther you will stand when you talk. Only the closest person can get close to the "half-arm" range, which is the scope of trust. When the locals use mobile phones, they are only half-armed from the information, and the invisible trust is generated. This is in line with the theory of the Knox Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
