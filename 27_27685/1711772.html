			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the battle progressed, Giant Kerry added a lot of wounds to his body. Although these wounds are not deep, most of them are simply scratches, but the results are also surprising to everyone. The crowds on the scene lament the martial arts skills of this outsider. Siegel keeps circling and keeps his distance with spears. Fortunately, the spears of the Jackdaw tribe are longer than the common ones, otherwise it is really difficult to gain this advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the savvy is higher and learns again, this is the martial art that Kerry has seen in his brother for the past ten years. Familiar, he was quickly discovered by him. The giants doubled their hands and found the real one from the illusory gunshot, then clamped it with brute force, broke it, and threw it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashed the lance and smashed it on Kerry’s shoulder, but that didn’t help. The giant suddenly grabbed the squid's arms, held the palm of his hand like a pliers, and then lifted it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only has his forearm to move, just to the dagger next to the belt. He hooked his finger on the dagger and rolled over while Kerry slammed him on the floor. The dagger points to the giant's abdomen and will slant his ribs up. Siegel was shocked and quickly turned his wrist back. A thin blood line appeared on Kerry, only staying on the surface, not deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel fell heavily on the ground, he only felt that the internal organs had to move the position, and the bones of the whole body made a squeaking sound. The dwarf's golden belt played a role, and a force from the earth kept Siegel tough. Although he suffered from all the pain, he avoided breaking the bone and losing his fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your dagger is really sharp, my flesh is completely unbearable, even if I try to shrink, I will be cut." Kerry looked at his wound, I found that the first place was deeper and the wound was getting shallower. Then I said, "Are you taking it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You save with a snake I, I can't hold you heavy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You helped me kill the green-footed snake before, and the snake must have been yours." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also opened the snake's mouth with the hand, and it was caught several times." Siegel shrugged his shoulders and said with a spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also used a long whip to open me and escape the lightning. If it fell in the pond, the dragon skin on my body could not prevent the thunder. The power." Kerry smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's not be polite here, you should be careful in the battle behind. You know, putting down the spear will make me more difficult. "Siegel whispered the secret, and the wand popped into his palm. Feeling familiar with the wood, he felt that breathing and heartbeat were smooth. "This is not ordinary wood. He is very hard and can be used as a dagger. So you should be careful with your left and right hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mage! He is actually A mage!" The crowd of people shouted. "Witchcraft! He wants to curse! Call the priests to come!" Someone shouted: "This is not honor! This is a play! How can a wizard participate in the contest?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it seems that everyone has forgotten the fierce fighting just now, forgetting the confrontation between the spear and the shield, the fist and the knife. The chiefs looked at each other and didn't know what to do with it. Let the prince and the warrior compare is the same thing, let him play against the wizard? He needs more weapons, such as bows and arrows, shooting guns, nets, and strong tower shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deprive him of the power to use spells, this is a contest, not a spell duel." Someone said in the head of the Kraft chief: "Otherwise this will become A farce. No one wants to see the face of the prince of Kerry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain raised the ice gun, the obsidian radiated dazzling Rays. The crowd quickly calmed down and knew that the chieftain had something to say. Kerry looked at his father, shook his head gently, and slammed the two fists. His meaning is clear: the competition is going to be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Siegel can learn spells while practicing martial arts, that is his skill. The idea in Kerry’s heart is very simple. ‘I’m diligent in martial arts, but I’m going to see if he can use it to bring me down! '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the Krauf hesitated and found that everyone was watching him, so he had to declare: "The contest continues, no objection."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew from Kerry, making him seem like a frost giant from the extremely cold hell, driving the death of the frozen thing, exuding endless majesty. This is the natural strength of the family of the evil spirit tribe, which is said to have come from the ancestors of the Frost Giant. Their family has always been taller than being raised, and Kerry is one of the best. He was born with a more pronounced power of frost, and he was able to use cold, attack, or defense when he was an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good! Finally you can cool down!" Siegel is more excited, cheering and continuing to circle around the giants, looking for fighters. He knows that his dagger is sharp, so he only wants to use speed to capture the fleeting fighters and subdue each other. He also kept a clear line in the enthusiasm of the battle, and did not want to hurt the other's life - Kerry is the same idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So both have reservations, and it’s because of this that the battle has been deadlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Siegel has been covered with frost and his movement speed has dropped. Just as Kerry wanted to hold him, he found three more Siegels around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imaginary?" Kerry was only slightly stunned, and he raised his right hand and waved a cold wind. He can feel through this wind that the opposite Siegel is a physical or a virtual shadow. This is the opportunity that Siegel has been waiting for. The squid is hidden on the right side of the giant, using his wave to raise his arm and start up quickly, and quickly close the distance. He held the dagger in his right hand, preparing to hold the opponent's key and ending the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry suddenly understood Siegel’s thoughts, but it’s too late to escape. The instinct of long-term battle made him turn awkward and knocked down from the top with his right elbow. Siegel's dagger was attached to Kerry's chest, and Kerry's elbow also touched Siegel's heavenly cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly separated, and Kerry touched the injury that did not exist in his chest, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Siegel tried to scratch his head, and the hair there had already formed ice. The two men looked at each other and smiled and gave each other a thumbs up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me are no longer only giving one side to Kerry, but shouting: "The Warriors! All are good!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a woman passed through the crowd and squeezed into the position of the leader. This unusual move caught everyone’s attention. The guards recognized that this was the maid of the Kerry family, the black wolf tribe who accompanied the princess. She was a little flustered, although she didn't make a big voice, but it was still heard by many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be born!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who were present in the competition heard this sentence, Siegel saw Kerry's brow wrinkled, although he still stared at himself, but there was still a worry between the eyebrows. So Siegel put away the dagger and his wand and stood up and said, "This can't be beaten. I can't stop a husband to look after the wife that will be produced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he is facing the chief, after the salute, he said: "If you continue to fight, I will win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clough The chieftain also wanted to know the situation of his daughter-in-law and grandson. He deliberately discussed with the elders around him and then announced: "The trial is sacred, and this is even more honorable and fair. In order to continue to maintain such honor and justice, The trial is temporarily suspended and will continue tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Jackdaw Tribe is so arbitrarily treated as a trial, so sloppy end, is it not afraid of the spirit of fighting to punish? "Maudant Black, the leader of the Northern Wild Bears tribe raised objections." He is a ferocious brawny man with a heavy nasal voice. Even at noon on this hot autumn day, he wore a black bearskin coat and put a huge bear on his head. With the rhythm of his speech, the bear skin shook and swayed. He has always been grumpy and likes to force people, so he is called a violent bear, but he calls himself a big bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the living is higher than that of the deceased, so everything can be endless." The chief of the Kraffo stopped and looked directly at the "Big Bear" Mohart. . "And I think my grandson has this privilege to see the heroic battle of his father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people agree and offer blessings. The big bear is pouting, a look that doesn't agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet had a hand on her chest and a machete, ran over to see Siegel, and then licked Kerry’s eyes. However, the giant did not notice her expression, because his mind was on the wife to be produced. Under the crowd of people, Kerry strode out of the contest and ran to his tent. Siegel took a sigh of relief and quietly said to Janet: "I am exhausted, I will have no physical strength, I will give you a hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
