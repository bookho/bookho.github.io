			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the orc brought the Wolves, a group of gray, black and gray-black giant wolves searched around under the leadership of the Green Orc, Siegel has long since left the previous position and waited at the agreed meeting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small hill, when there is a stream in the rainy season, now the orc army throws garbage and excrement. It's easy to think of why Chanem will choose this place to meet: Anyway, it is not him who waits longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grabbed his nose with a three-layered handkerchief, but still couldn’t stop the raging smell. Now this taste is just resting on his clothes, but it is hard to say whether it will penetrate into the skin, even to the deeper parts of his skin. And from time to time, there are shark-headed workers who push more filth to come here, while squatting, dumping things indiscriminately. Siegel chose a windward place and waited behind a large stone covered with moss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From day to night, Siegel counts the carts here and hopes to see Chanem’s figure – if Chanem appears The cart that transports the body is even more perfect. However, life is not good, there is no **, he did not see the body of Chanem, even the living Chanem did not see! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bunch of sunlight disappeared behind the western horizon, and the sky was ruled by dark clouds and looming silver moonlight. "It’s been past the agreed time." Siegel frowned. There was a lot of fire in the camp of the orcs in the distance, dinner was going on, and everything seemed normal. According to Channim’s ability, the intelligence that he wants to spy on “why the orcs come” is not so long. It is very likely that he will be deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!" If Chanem is simply looking for a fire, then if he sells his position to the orc in some way, then everything will be abandoned. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this situation did not happen, and there was no orc to come around in the stinking garbage. Perhaps Chanem knows that the orc's round-up will only cause trouble. It is impossible to catch Siegel. It is not as bad as the stench, so he "puts" him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel decided not to wait any longer, and he slowly slipped in the direction of the strongest perception according to the guidance of the Lord of the Rings. The closer to the castle. The more defensive the defense, the almost to reach the foot to step on the orc. Fortunately, the orcs have already eaten enough, and they are organizing night-time siege wars, and all fronts are messy. Siegel changed into a kobold. With a broken iron helmet in his hands, he stumbled and walked beside the orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene is very common: an orc sends the kobold to take his helmet, and then whipped him for a reason, even pinched directly Let yourself be more favored by the gods in battle and become more brave. So the orcs just looked at the kobold. Give him a few more feet and he will not pay too much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped and stopped to avoid appearing too much in the Orc patrol's field of vision. Unlike the siege army, these patrols are directly responsible to the orc priests, who specialize in inspecting the chaos in the camp to maintain order. No orc general is willing to deal with the patrol, but they all hope that their competitors can be troubled by the patrol. Siegel observed for a while and felt that these patrols were not just as simple as patrolling the camp to maintain order. They were consciously searching for outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is close to the front of the front, but the perception of the Lord of the Rings continues to move forward. Siegel stopped. Put a broken iron helmet on your head and find a broken machete from the orc blacksmith's waste. He gathered with a few Kobolds who were dressed up like him, and shivered in the gaze of the orcs. There is only one choice to get close to the city wall, and that is to charge with the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His location is the cannon fodder team, used to waste enemy arrows and disrupt their goals. If you can rush to the wall, the small body of the Kobold can play a good role in the narrow passage, and besieged with the orcs. Such a kobold will get a good reward, such as a three-day meal or a small armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't see the kobold shivering now, but that's not a battle. It is the threat of the orcs. Once on the battlefield, the group of kobolds will become crazy, bloodthirsty, rushing into the battlefield and killing the right. Injury with weapons and teeth until one party loses its advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drums are ringing, and the giant drums on the ten sides make the earth feel a little shaken. I believe no one in the castle can fall asleep. Both the orcs and the kobolds can see things in the dark, so they don't need to ignite the torches. Instead, humans must illuminate with the brazier to see the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the first two times, the human defenders will shoot these wolves. Later, they found that these wolves were thick and flexible, and their hit rate was not high. They no longer waste energy. Just need to focus on the removal of the tower, don't let the beasts rush up, you can restrain the wolves very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two archer's superb shooters are still named after the long bow in their hands, several wolves have been injured, but become more ferocious, faintly violent the trend of. At this time, the orc army began to move forward, knocking over and extinguishing the fire-fighting seedlings - mostly caused by rockets - all the way to push the siege tower forward. The Kobolds were wrapped up in this team, and Siegel was screaming forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is full of dead bodies left in the daytime battles, blood and minced meat make the ground muddy and slippery. Siegel deliberately slammed his feet, rolled over and fell, then squatted on the ground and slowly moved forward. He soon became unnoticed, whether it was an orc or a human defender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Lord of the Rings guidelines, Siegel climbed to the side of the battlefield, where the river bay was in contact with the city wall. A river terminal was built there, but it was dismantled at the beginning of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid river floods, the gates of the River Bay Pier are higher than other gates, and a ramp opens the gap of five meters from the ground. There is a suspension bridge with six chains. When I learned that the orc was in force, the suspension bridge was collected early, so if you want to enter from this gate, you not only need to storm the gate, but also lay a five-meter-high slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it is not far from the water gate, and the constantly appearing collision boat also attracts a lot of attention, so there is no attention here, and there are not a few orcs. Charge here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide to the Lord of the Rings is in this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squirmed slowly on the ground, trying not to attract attention. There are always orc warriors falling down beside him, as well as flying and flying. Fortunately, the size of the dog's head is small, and the chance of being injured is low. So far, he has not finished hanging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orc was shot in the neck, slammed down and blocked in front of Siegel. He still didn't breathe, and fiercely pulled out his neck. As a result, the blood could not stop moving out of the wound and could not be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the kobold who was crawling, and at a glance he understood that it was a deserter, or a miscellaneous on the battlefield. The orc raised his hand and prepared to smother this "traitor" before he died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tenacious spirit makes Siegel feel admired, but this is not the reason for him to get what he wants. ** The teacher thought about it, reached out and took out a packet of powder from the space bag, and whispered a few spells on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc can't hear what the Kobold said, and crawled forward. Because of blood loss and suffocation, his vision gradually blurred, but the orcs have sufficient self-confidence. If you can pinch the throat of the kobold, it is absolutely this little brown thing to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, Siegel stuffed the paper bag into the wound in his neck when the orc had not touched it. The orc's eyes were full of horror, and I don't know why the Kobold had such a fast speed. He felt that the things in his neck were hot and cold, and spread with his heartbeat. If you are not fatally injured, this feeling will not be a problem, but now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't make the spell work too fast, so he hooks it on the orc's trachea with his hand. He slammed it hard and pinched it. The orc struggled a few times, finally screaming and slamming his head to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong sense of the dead spirit in the powder began to weaken, and soon became undetectable, and the rate of penetration gradually slowed down. Under the influence of the spell, the orc will stand up again in the form of a ghoul or a zombie, causing trouble to the orc. If the orcs put the corpses together, it is possible to produce a group of undead monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they track down afterwards, and they don’t think that casting is done on the battlefield, they will think that the undead is an accident. This is also how much obstacles are created for the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel moves around the orc's body and moves closer and closer to the destination. He climbed over a shackle, but he was shocked by the sight in front of him. In the direction of his destination, more than twenty orc warriors arrived, and they used shields to form an upward shield wall barrier to block the falling rock of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
