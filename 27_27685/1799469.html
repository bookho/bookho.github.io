			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is sitting in the library of the goblin, with paper and electronic books around him, he is reading To polymer materials science - he has been here for two full months. Everything I saw in this world made him feel extremely uncomfortable. This subversive and accurate heinous research method reminded him of his feelings as a dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that in the undead state, his efficiency in studying spells and deriving magic arrays is very high. Abandoning the interference of the outside world, shielding the fluctuations of the heart, the world becomes a two-faced existence: non-death is born, non-black is white, right is wrong, non-good is evil. Just like the opposite side of the front must be the opposite side, the back of the road must be the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel experienced this feeling, guessing what the way of thinking would eventually bring, and now he saw it with his own eyes. He saw that powerful power was born in the hands of the goblin, and the deep knowledge piled up with huge rooms. They studied themselves and found ways to live forever; they studied the sky and learned to fly without wings. No spells are needed, no divine power is needed, and they rely on technology to conquer their own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth is stronger than the Thunder Wall, with 7.3 billion goblins living in this world, and they have enough power to destroy themselves or the wall of the Thunder Wall more than 50 times. - as long as they know how to pass the grain wall barrier. They will try hard until they reach the opposite side, because this earth is powerful, but it is on the verge of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large city close to the goblin, the yellow-gray air made Siegel into a poisoning state, and the disease began to spread in his set of organs. The goblins draw fuel from the earth, then burn it into the air in various ways, and slowly poison themselves while gaining false happiness. The carrying capacity of the planet is basically at its limit. The goblins have not yet been able to travel to other planets. They don't know when they can complete the study of starry travel. But they know that they continue to destroy the environment, when the end of the world and the extinction will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what did Goblin do? They just did nothing and continued their past lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two ways to live forever, one is the youth agent. One is to enter the star network." Siegel read in a book Similar words. The goblins fantasize that they can abandon their bodies and enter the virtual world, just as the virtual world will be more real than the real world. This seems to be the result of long-term influence by the legendary spell "Star God Network." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A legendary spell that does not require a magical foundation - Siegel evaluates the Star God network in this way. Through reading, Siegel will not make a star network. But I also understand what this network is—the technical product of electricity, magnetic storage, and the transmission of information—but he still stubbornly turns it into a legendary spell, even a legendary spell with a godhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods form a similar network through the prayers of believers. Nexus controls the army with similar techniques. Siegel also used the same idea to create the electromagnetic killer spider. . However, the Star God network does not have a real core, and it cannot be completely destroyed by destroying certain places. It will always exist. Unless the world is wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy is a concept that every creature has come into contact with, whether it is humans, elves, dwarves, even the most peaceful halfling gardener is very clear about the word Meaning, but no one has an understanding of it that can reach the level of the Earth's Goblin. For a goblin who has become accustomed to the "two states of everything", once the war is open, it must be endless, and complete elimination will end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a "folly" day for Goblin. They believed in restrained revenge and believed in the rules of engagement. It can be "developed" with the times. As long as it is not the enemy of the enemy, as long as it is the enemy, it should be destroyed. Then the rules of engagement are getting weaker and thinner, and the bottom line of elimination is getting lower and lower. The history of Siegel reading the goblins is like watching the death of the knightly spirit. From the one-on-one duel of the leader to decide the outcome, to the confrontation on the battlefield, to the unspoken sneak attack to become the norm, and then to spread the scope of the battle to civilians. There used to be a term called add-on damage, which is now gone. Siegel looked at the results of a small-scale conflict between hundreds of goblins and saw only two words: "Destroy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes will sooner or later destroy themselves, and their dualism has been nailed to this result. Another possibility is that they are distressed on this earth. The last bit of life was wiped out by poisonous air and toxic food. The goblin had no time to leave the planet before it was exhausted, but at this time, the dwarf opened the barrier of the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for this, it is enough for the 7.3 billion goblin to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Siegel’s first reaction was to escape, far from the damn war. Goblin has long forgotten what is called a hand, they will never stop attacking, their tactics have no bottom line, their goals are not differentiated, and they are not "civilized" in this respect. As long as you find a way to get the door spell of the alien world and solve the problem of how to escape, it is not complicated to escape. The multiverse is vast and innocent. As a sergeant, where can't it be a place to stay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can take Janet, Isaac, and all the people he cares about. But is this ok? Siegel knows that he can't leave with Heim, and it is even more impossible to leave the world with him. Then the problem changes. Can he leave those who can't leave to go on the road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tough question, and Siegel thought for six days in the luxurious room that Gru arranged for him. This question is not related to knowledge, technology-related, power-free, irrelevant to magic, and even irrelevant to Janet and Isaac. Siegel only asks himself, he must have a very clear answer to this, one is about humanity. s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seventh day, he finally made his mind clear. He can let Janet, Isaac and all the people he cares about leave, but he does not want to leave. Not wanting, not, no, no, no, just not willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one possibility, that is, the goblin breaks the barrier of the crystal wall, gains resources and longevity, and avoids the fate of the trapped earth. Then they are likely to embark on the stars and even embark on the journey of the multiverse. This is a shameful opponent, and the races with whom he fights will become shameful. The entire multiverse will have no lower limit, and perhaps the entire main material plane will be occupied by this chaotic and evil goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect can even affect the outer plane. The endless abyss will expand, and perhaps there will be no more heavens. Although this possibility is low, it exists, just under the eyes of Siegel, it actually exists. This is the risk that Siegel can't take. He also does not allow himself to ignore this risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this kind of thought is similar to the goblin, and takes inevitable action to stop a certain possibility. When the bottom line of the possibility continues to decline, it will eventually become destroyed for nothing. Siegel suddenly had a feeling that his thoughts seemed to be polluted by the goblin and began to become extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before being driven into madness, Siegel returned to the city of Mith through the silver line projected by the astral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to breathe back into pure air makes him a new life, the fragrance of the earth and the tweet of the birds make it like heaven. The elements leaped cheerfully, they felt the return of the sorcerer and sang a happy song. Siegel never felt that the world was so beautiful, just like looking at heaven in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinette, who heard the news, hurriedly ran. Siegel, who saw "live", could not help but burst into tears. She opened her arms and wanted to come over and hug, and Siegel raised her hand to hold her in the air. "Water, I have to clean it thoroughly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants are busy, hurry to burn hot water and prepare for the bath. "Don't bathe, I just need a big bucket. No one should stay close to me until I feel clean!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel keeps washing himself. The Astral Projection does not bring back the things that the Stars are contaminated. The experience on Earth is just a simple memory. The body is actually in a state of stagnation, and even a piece of dust will not fall, let alone dirty. Siegel knows this very well. He just wants to get rid of the filth in the soul. The vividness around him made him cry in the tub, and after a few hours he finally eased. He remembered that the law of the multiverse should be "everything is done, everything is three", not damn black and white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the return. He has basically no activity, just holding Janet gently and resting quietly in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the return, he had a full day of activities, and Janet, in the bedroom bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of the return. He got up and left the bedroom, becoming the lord of Heim, the Marquis of the Star Kingdom, and the sergeant of the Federation. Janet was so tired that she was lying in bed and had a full day off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He convened the council meeting of the federation. In addition to him, Wendy, Simonton, and Weywood also wore the robes of the sergeant. Everyone wants to know the situation on earth, with a curious expression on their faces. They have countless questions to ask, but when they see Siegel's unusually serious expression, it seems to have been cast a fixed and silent spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
