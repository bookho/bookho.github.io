He sat by the fireplace and baked his hands to keep it soft and flexible. The light of the four elements flashed in turn, causing the fire of the fireplace to continually jump, just like having life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things in the kingdom of the stars have been raging, and even the New World has been affected. If it is not the sight of the biggest kingdom of mankind, the elves will dare to conquer in the New World. War? Evan is not a magician. It is really unfortunate to have disappeared under your heavy concern. I remember that you have the support of the school city and the morning temple. What does he have?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd did not pay attention to Siegel’s ridicule and still maintains the grace of the elders. He touched his short beard and observed every movement of the Master Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the trans-oceanic transmission array, only one method of sea-going can pass two continents. The Stars of the Royal Family ruled in the Old World. What can Evan do here? Can you borrow the soldiers and horses and bring them back to the kingdom of stars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of this that Siegel has doubts about the motives of Count Todd. From the current situation, it may be far more malicious than goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Returning 10,000 steps, if I meet Evan, I will tell him what he forgives." Siegel said softly: "I don't know what instructions are there under His Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. His Majesty the King believes that the loyalty and character of the jazz will reward you and reward the New World. Unity and peace.” Count Todd said: “Hay is one of the great territories of the New World. Do you need a consultant from the city?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you pick it yourself? You have to find some ability to cast spells better than me." Siegel laughed and said: "It is best to send a sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In addition to the Lear Master, there is no sorcerer in the school." The count stood up and patted the folds on his trousers. He said in a tone of delivery: "Before leaving, there is a notice here, which is an elected person. Queen's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took over, looked at his eyes and received the sleeves. From the national beauty pageant, Aaron’s body bones are suffering? It seems that the great aristocrats have turned their attention to the heirs of the manufacturing. Prepare to squeeze out the last trace of blood in the kingdom of stars. Evan is in a dire situation, and Siegel is now hoping that he can come to the city of Miele. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for choosing a beautiful woman, he is going to burn out when he is ready to go out - it is a waste of time, labor and money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Walk, there is nothing to open in front of the meeting." Siegel said to Count Todd: "Don't bother to learn the city's Master to send me. Just send it once. I will be familiar with it. Remember to tell the lords, I welcome, support, and discuss how to play the elves, but don't think about moving the idea of ​​Heim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Todd nodded and watched Siegel step into the space vortex and leave the reception room. He threw the cup into the fireplace. Watch it smash and smash, then sit down and think carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ camps outside the city of Mith have been abandoned, and they have retired more than 50 miles to the east and they have relocated. It is on the edge of the Great Rift Valley and is the intersection of the original Shield River and the Ghost Fog. Shield River rushed into the dark underground tunnel without heading back, and no one knew where it finally headed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain here is complex, leaving few routes for the cavalry to charge, only need to build the fortification to defend. And there are few people here, most of them still maintain the natural features, and the strength of the druids can be improved. They are transformed into animals. A layer of defense is arranged, and it is basically impossible to patrol day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel had no brains. It’s already a lucky thing that sneak attacks and surprises can be cheap, and he won’t approve any battle unless it’s hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I went to the front line for a few laps and didn't find any chance." Mana said: "The Lord, the elf puts a hope that they surround him." Attitude, but we can't be fooled – Heim has not enough troops to carry out the encirclement in the wild.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Keep the current state. If the elf comes out, Still relying on harassment.” Siegel had an idea, so he said, “Pay attention to the total strength of the elves. Be careful. The seeds that we planted in the ghost fog swamps are particularly good, and it is estimated that they will be harvested soon. It is likely to use it as a bait to try to eliminate our mobile power. If such a thing happens, food and harvest can be avoided. Don't entangle with the elves, so as not to control the situation and develop into a field matchup."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very fortunate to be able to survive the war." Mana said: "My parents and family died because of the war. The battle between the lords destroyed the tranquility of the country. The number of knights and lords was sharply reduced. There is no guarantee that patrols will lead to robbery. If it is not because of his age and his body is thin, he can be hidden in the tree hole, and I will be killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Geer nodded. "So, I would rather win later, be ugly, and keep enough military power to maintain the order." He paused and said, "Is there any news about Elijah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only know that she is still commanding the army, but I don't know how the injury is." Mana showed a smile: "The Lord, you are merciful?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know it, don't talk." Siegel let the four elements jump between his fingers and said with a serious expression: "I know, I am very good." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking out of the question, The news of the caravans, some territories posted notices, the king of the kingdom of stars is going to choose a woman to enter the palace, it is possible to be a queen, is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The notice is true, but the one that was given to me was accidentally lost. I am still fighting, and these things will be said after peace - if they still remember to replenish me with a notice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood, I will tell the knights who are hot-headed, let them calm down, don't send their daughters out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, when I officially became the count, you will be a viscount, and you still have a castle. But I have never seen anyone who pursues you, why?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't have the courage." Mana blinked and lied: "I reprimanded them all day, I am afraid that in their hearts I am the same as the half-orc. People? Zucker is not married now, and it’s not good to say that half-orcs can live for a short time.”<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pinched his chin and was removed from the target. "Yeah, this needs to be noted. He is also a lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight took the opportunity to retire, and by the way said to the gram Sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally someone is pursuing her. Including knights, jazz or people who think they are handsome. Siegel’s knowledge of the nobility was also half-way, and naturally he did not know how creative his jazz and half-orc jazz was. Although it is not clear that this is not feasible, and according to the absolute power of the lord to control his territory, others cannot make irresponsible remarks. But it is extremely rare for a woman to become a jazz and a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are trying to pursue Mana, hoping to step into the sky and become a real power aristocrat with territory. No one can touch her heart. The horsewoman unscrupulously let all the pursuers get out of the way, and even let the half-orc guards interrupt the hands and feet of several people. After such a tough attitude spread, no one dared to rush to her in front of her to express her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is Mana so. Many people have guesses, most of them faintly point to Siegel. Many people sighed at Mana, thinking that this wasted a great aristocratic title and resources. Fortunately, no one dared to disclose this thing to Siegel, otherwise it would be angered by Mana and then pursued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why Mike has never been married... no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare that the rest of the day does not have to deal with war, politics, and territory-related matters. Siegel also temporarily put down the magic book to look after his son. In theory, he has been with his son, but he is using the body of the raven. Now Raven Barron is the child's most loyal nanny, always with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel picked up the child. Take him for a walk in the city of Miele. There was a garden behind the castle, but it was opened up during the war to make a vegetable plot. For children, whether it is a garden or a vegetable patch, green leaves and yellow soil are his favorite toys. Isaac began to learn to crawl in this mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Lord personally went into battle, demonstrating how the standard crawling was, but Isaac just smiled and still wriggles with the lizard's posture. In desperation, Siegel patted the soil from the ground and went by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
