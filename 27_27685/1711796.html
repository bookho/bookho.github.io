			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bloodblood)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of everyone are concentrated on the prince’s body, they clean up The big bed, let the Reese doctor let go of the space, and then wait quietly outside. The physician was a middle-aged man with a spirited mind. He hurriedly entered the big account with a medicine box and then drove out the knights inside. "Go out, there is no place for you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally fresh air around the prince, and Rees was serving him meticulously. No mercenary and "outsiders" were in front of him, and Count Todd's face became very gloomy. He replaced the spare chain armor and iron gloves with a silent voice, and put on the sword, guarding the temple. By his side, there is only one last morning guard, or the weakest one. He was arranged to stay in the camp and pay special attention to the water safety of the main aristocrats such as the prince, in order to avoid the fate of death in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prince is guilty of blood loss, no life is at risk." After the doctor examined it, he said to Earl Todd. "I can match the blood medicine, but it takes time to be effective. I am worried that the delay will damage his internal organs. Therefore, it is necessary to give blood to His Royal Highness in order to heal as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Transfusion? What does this mean?" asked the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Injecting the blood of others into the body of the temple." Dr. Siegel replied: "There is a need for nutrients in the blood to replenish the loss as soon as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl was furious and slammed the sword out and put it on the doctor's neck, scaring him to kneel down immediately. "What kind of heart do you want to pollute the blood of the royal family? Do you think this sword is not sharp enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese physician trembled and folded his hands together: " Don't get me wrong, I don't know what the count is. In the camp, there is a person who also has the blood of the royal family. Although the surname of Evan is not a star, he is indeed the son of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan is now taking a doctor's bandage in the camp to wrap his arm burns. Even if he doesn't look up, he can still feel the eyes of others focused on himself. This kind of gaze has long been accustomed to in his life. As a "golden sunflower", this kind of gaze is a blessing to me, and I can't hurt me - he is so comfortable. But put my blood into the body of Evan? I was also taken a lot of blood by my blood magician not long ago, but who cares? The illegitimate child can only think this way in his heart. He knows that his own interests are meaningless in front of his brother. Just as this matter has no room for negotiation. "I have no problem." Evan did not lift his head and replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count’s sword was slightly raised a little, but still beside the physician’s ear. He thought for a moment and then asked: "Is there any other way besides this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This method is most effective between urgency." Physician Nodded, then said to the count: "The prince is also the safest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." The count put the sword away and let the doctor stand up. . Then he turned and said to Evan: "The kingdom needs your service, and your Highness is also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom always needs an illegitimate service, Evan thought. He stretched out his arms to reveal a pale, weak arm, and the dark blue blood vessels were clearly visible. "Mr. Physician, you can use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please leave everyone, this includes you, Earl." The doctor rubbed his hands on his chest. While bowing down and saying: "There are only two royal bloodlines left in the camp to avoid pollution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Guards are still moving, still sticking Beside the prince. The doctor came to him and said unceremoniously: "When the operation, my knife is on his neck. If I want to hurt the prince, you can't save it. You are useless here, and it will harm your highness. Life, why not quickly retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young morning guards are overwhelmed, he has not yet experienced the task alone, and no captain can give orders. He turned his inquiries to the count and did not receive any response. The physician constantly urged him to ask if he could take responsibility for the treatment error. This morning guard had to compromise. "I will stay at the gate of the camp." He can only say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let people bother us." The physician said: "In addition to treatment, all things let them go to the count."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan picked up his clothes and could see his body covered with scars. His swordsmanship did not fall out of thin air, but was gradually obtained with hard training. In the capital of the starry kingdom, only the long sword is his only brother. With the help of this steel brother, he defeated one swordsman and another, but also left another wound on his body. There are stab wounds, cuts, cuts, hammers, claw marks, and tooth marks. The layers are intricate and complex, just like a graffiti map. The stitching marks are thin and dense, and basically less than a good skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the wound under the clothes, even the Rees physician took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such an exaggeration?" Evan sucked his nose and said in a mocking tone: "As long as my face is still handsome and handsome, the wound on my body can hinder it." What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss's mouth twitches, revealing a strange smile. He opened a small box of fine wood in the medicine box with gray sponge fragments. At the bottom of the box, the worms of several fingers are sleeping. The doctor carefully picked one out with a pair of tweezers and placed it in front of him to look closely at its fine teeth and sharp needles. The worm was disturbed, twisting his body uncomfortably, and the yellow-brown liquid flowed under his translucent skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would rather have your face messed up, and the body is intact." Dr. Ress extended a finger and pressed Evan's heart, carefully feeling the heart below. The pulsation of blood vessels. "I need to use this water to suck blood, use drugs to stimulate them to transport blood to the prince. Unlike the general leeches, my worms for blood transfusion will bring intense pain, need to drink the anesthetic drugs first, sleep ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not allow me to numb me." Evan said very firmly: "I am afraid that if I sleep, I will never wake up again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Your Highness Evan." Dr. Reese looked at his eyes, a meaningful smile: "You will not die, because only the living royal family Blood is useful. Want me to prepare belts and sticks for you, at least when you are in pain, you can bite in your mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not your Highness." The text says: "Give me a dagger, the belt and the stick are not what the swordsman should use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I need to tie you to the bed, and please Try not to make a sound, it will affect the effect." The doctor is as meticulous as taking care of his own child, check each one Insects. Then he prepared a few fine needles, a clean empty bowl, and lit a brazier around each other, then washed the chests of the two people. Subsequently, he sprinkled the powder and spread it evenly with his fingers. "One side stimulates it to suck, and the other side stimulates it to vomit." He finally checked the bundled straps to make sure that Evan couldn't struggle. Then he placed a otter on the illegitimate child and placed another dry worm in the heart of Prince Aaron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sputum slowly sucks blood, except for some itching, there is no feeling of pain. Evan looked at the doctor a little strangely, and the look was asking him: "Just like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physician smiled and swelled in red with a pair of tweezers The fat otter, pretending to be placed on the prince, but shook his wrist and threw it into the brazier. The flame instantly swallowed the leeches, burned it to black ash, and then the physician carefully clamped the worms of Prince Aaron's chest. At this time, the worm showed a fierce look, and another set of mouthparts was hidden in its fine teeth. The prince's efforts rolled in the abdominal cavity of the worm and dyed a hint of yellowish brown. Dr. Reese said in a soft voice: "It was just the first leeches, and the back needs to dig deep into the old wounds. Be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird The worm was placed on Evan's chest and madly drilled into his body after being stimulated by the drug. Evan wanted to scream loudly, but the pain made him only bite the dagger in his mouth. He beat the bed with both hands, again and again. After the doctor tied his wrist with a strap, he used his finger to hold the sheet tightly and tore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a worm, it is the second and the third. The doctor constantly transported the worm from the prince's chest to Evan, and then poured the drug into the prince's mouth. Aaron's body showed a strange flush, and the blood was squeezed out. A purple-black shadow shrouded the prince's lower eyebrows. This was a sign of cursing and bad luck, but Dr. Rees was unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how persistent, no matter how fearful he may be in a sleep, he still faints. When I woke up, I was lying on the cold ground, next to the pieces of the wooden bed. The doctor has wiped his body clean and is burning all the used "water scorpions" in the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
