			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco’s body fell in the cage, and Siegel left him to the crow in the sky. If not eaten by crows, the low temperatures and heavy snow here will keep the bodies for a long time. Siegel finally glanced at Lin Ke, who had served him, helped him and then sold him. He took the sword back and scabbard and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to make a decision now, which direction to go next. One way is to try to cross the walled mountains in the south, and go to the Black Blood Castle through the orc's heavy defense. The other is to go east along the Blackwater River to Macabu, where it returns to the south through the waterway. Both roads are full of unknown dangers and will be long and harsh. Siegel was awkward, and no one was there to guide him. It was useless to pray to God, and he must make this decision as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘To the south or to the north? ‘Siegel thought of a solution. He took the scorpion from the necklace and threw it into the air, watching it fall on the snow. The scorpion jumped and it took a long time to stop. "It's seven, the singularity goes to Macabu." Siegel picked up the scorpion and finally checked the dress. "It seems to be a sailor again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to walk for eight hours, with only one short break in the middle, and Siegel took the opportunity to A lot of barley flour was stuffed in the mouth and washed down with spirits. The orc patrols were encountered on the road, but Siegel found them far away and hid them in time. In the past when sailing on the sea, Siegel was good at discovering orcs, and now with the eyes of the raven, he can look farther from the air. The orcs all went in the same direction, the town of bacon. If you go later, you are likely to be trapped in the town and not get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the grasslands occupied by nomadic tribes, the north of the walled mountains is more barren and desolate, and the winter is approaching, the beasts also need to find places to shelter from the cold, so the Sieg On the way, except for the orc patrol, there was no living thing, but it was difficult to supplement the food. The eastward terrain is gradually decreasing, and it can be seen that the mountains are getting less and less, and the valleys are becoming wider and wider. Siegel walked for 30 miles and then no longer had the strength to maintain the pace of the elves. Considering that it is far from the bacon town, he chose to walk in the usual way. This will cause the Master's feet to sink into the snow, and the speed of action will be greatly reduced, but it will save physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the Black River made Siegel a sigh of relief. According to travel expert Eric, this big river with a width of 200 meters is never frozen, because its main water flow comes from the underground hot springs, blessed and protected by the fire, so even the coldest winter Will not let it also sail. It is said that the orcs who drink the river here have the power of fire and will not be hurt by the enemy's fire. However, Siegel does not believe that the body can distinguish whether the flame is a friend or an enemy? Every time the orc looting army is burned to death in the walled mountains, there is no effect on the power of the Black River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so far, Siegel has avoided the most dangerous wasteland, where there is no cover, no place to hide. . Now on the banks of the Black River, both sides of the river are washed out of the river valley. Under the water that never freezes, there are also dense trees growing here, enough to cover those dangerous sights. Siegel found a comfortable tree hole that night, and he put thick pine needles inside to squeeze in to avoid the cold caused by the cold outside. Siegel has not ignited for a long time to cook food, and now has a chance. He built a simple wall outside the tree hole with snow, which could both block the fire and protect the wind. The Frenzy Raven flew out to hunt during this time and was lucky enough to find a gray rabbit. The stupid rabbit was very fat, thinking that he would not be caught under a pile of dead branches. Barron's senses far exceed the average raven, he found it from afar, and then penetrated its head with fire rays. Siegel decided to reward his magical pet and give the rabbit half of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grasped the last light of the day, collected enough fuel and lit the fire. Siegel now only thinks about food, steaming rabbits and stews. The key space allows the food inside to not spoil, but it does not preserve the temperature of the food. Siegel took out carrots, onions and turnips, a small packet of salt. If there are other materials, such as potatoes or tomatoes, it will make him happier, but not too much in the wild, which is enough for him to spend a comfortable night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun drives the shadows to move between the trees, and finally the shadows on the west side become longer and longer, finally completely obscuring the inside of the tree hole, leaving only the red dragonfly The fire burned at the hole. Siegel threw all the rabbit's internal organs to the Raven, and then placed half of the peeled rabbit on the fire for a little barbecue, and the other half chopped and thrown in the helmet pot. There is water in the snow, and the stew can best comfort the tired body and relieve the nervous nerves. It didn't take long for Siegel to eat stewed rabbit meat, and Barron was enjoying the minced meat that Siegel had helped him with. It doesn't like things that are completely cooked, but the meat that is half-baked is better than raw meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
