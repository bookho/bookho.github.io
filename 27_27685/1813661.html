This time, his resurrection ability was sealed by the Obsidian Dagger, and death really came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney cut the orc's skin with a dagger and put his hand in. After searching for a lap, he pulled out an energy sphere with a pale green glow. The cold and serious face couldn't help but bring a surprise look when he saw this thing. Chanem took his nose and sucked it on the ball of light. Most of the energy was introduced into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing Siegel has seen before, the mother of the earth, that is, the halfling who destroyed his head again and again, consumed It is this energy. Call it Holy Power, you can also call it the legendary spell seed fragments, but the angle of understanding is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Chanem has been in a very low state due to the fall of the murder god. Coupled with the consumption caused by repeated resurrection, he has a certain gap from his heyday. This gap makes him usually shrink, and the remaining eight points can only play six points. The Holy Power of the Orc Saint has long been in his plan, but only after the orcs are weakened by the hands of others. He is more confident in his success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few who can do this, and those who can do it are not necessarily willing to do this. But Siegel is a candidate who has the ability and willingness to do it. The fourth floor of the magic tower could not pass, and he did not know this thing. Inciting the orc saints to go up is not to verify again, but to create an opportunity for the orcs to go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s magical ability is amazing, and the means are endless, but the character is too easy to understand. It is also very easy to predict. When the orc saints find themselves on the fourth floor. Ninety percent may go to find someone to vent. At this time, as long as Siegel gets the news, more than 90% of them may stop it. Siegel will not kill the Orc Master, but he will certainly be able to beat him badly. Here is the godland of the magic god, certainly not to let the orc saints wild. Chanem used his planning skills to understand this point, set the trap step by step, and then push everyone into the middle of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guy" Siegel pointed to Chanem and said: "I have controlled the situation, you actually still"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you can stop me, but you don't." Chanem sneered twice. Relentlessly pointed out: "Beside me, these are not all your elements. You are shouting and screaming, but these guys are motionless. In your heart, I hope that this orc holy person will die." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No" Chanem shook his head: "Entering the Magic Academy After that, there is no such idea, but this idea is not present now, but much earlier. When we both arrived in Blackwater Bay and saw the human city besieged by the orcs, your heart has long thought Killing the Orc Saint, ending the war, can you deny this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closed his eyes and frowned. after awhile. "I can't deny it," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, honest child." Chanem stood up and grabbed the energy of the Holy Spirit. "You said that the orc holy people can not learn certain knowledge because of the restrictions of the rules. It is not good for obtaining the priesthood, but you are not so. Do you dare to say that you have no preference? Can you be a bowl of water after becoming a god? Pray to you and gain more power to satisfy your killing ambitions, such as using magic to summon a meteor to destroy a town. Can you satisfy his wishes? It is a matter of no humanity to become a god. You will eventually become a There are three illusions about mortal tools, and I can control the situation is one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original closed eyes opened, but there is no Chann expected The confusion in the middle. "Are you using my character's shortcomings to explain your behavior? Do I have any illusions about you? I don't have to satisfy you, and I don't need to listen to your teachings in everything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You damn bastard" Chanem waving his dagger, but he was beaten out with a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed into shadows and soot, which resolved the power of the rock, but there was no good way to follow the lightning and ice. The most troublesome thing for him is the element of fire. Light and heat are always his weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channem just saw the tragic situation of the orc saint being besieged. The frontal battlefield has no melee ability compared to the orc saint, so I just thought about it. . If you are trapped on the ground, the four elements together, it seems that there is no way to deal with it. So he suddenly jumped up and slammed into the fist of the Earth Element Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is empty, the shadow and the weight of the smoke, Chanem is like a light sandbag, and is suddenly flying out. In a short moment, he vacated his hand and used the help of Holy Power to simulate the display of a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the anti-magic field to wrap yourself so that no summoning creature can approach him. Although he has lost most of his ability to change, at least he has a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erase the blood from the corner of his mouth, and the wound on his body is quickly restored. Chanem holds the obsidian dagger and stares at Siegel's eyes full of fierce light. "Good boy, dare to be right with me"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the first time, isn’t your memory good?” Siegel looks at Chanem Said: "I said, from now on to stop hostility, together to study how to crack the falsified magic school, whether you are the ear of the wind and want to use the orcs to stand up, you misplaced the idea"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the long sword back into the sheath, and the wrist flipped and held another obsidian dagger in his hand. "The Holy One is very difficult to deal with, but it depends on who wants to try it. Since the Elven War, I have been studying how to fight against the Holy One. It is longer than studying the nuclear, magic spaceship and so on. You'd better go all out, this time you can't give a lesson like the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney sipped a sip of blood on the ground and went Blood between the teeth. "I have nothing to do here, but I have lost some advantages in the process of competing for the throne. You are different. You have to lose much more than Siegel. Are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been here for a few years, what progress has you made in addition to learning the magic that you didn't understand?" Siegel said: "I need to use the power of everyone to find the problem here and solve it. The smarter the mage helps me, the more worthy of helping each other. If you say something bad, you are far from magic. Do you think I need you more, or you need me more?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you the secrets of the fire and the priesthood"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is So, when you first tried to succumb to success, I forgive you.” Siegel said: “Although it’s only a few hours for me, but for you, This is forgiveness for stealing seven years of progress. Maybe you don't know what is fair, but you don't want to use your way. Kidnapping, I want to fight and say, your character is not enough for me to treat you as a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for your anti-magic field, Very clever choices can add a lot of chances to win.” Siegel asked with a smile: “I dare not say that I can win, but I can do it with you.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaney took a deep breath, then turned his wrists, and the black meteorites were collected and the shoulders were loose. "I killed the orc saint, and you have finished the lesson. If you want to continue killing me, then let's do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a murderer, What does it mean to kill and kill all day?" Siegel waved his hand and let the Elemental Legion open a path. In fact, there is an anti-magic force field, and all summoning creatures close to Chanem will be broken down, and only the original elemental creatures will not be affected. So Chanem wants to go, the elemental legion can't stop him, and Siegel is just to make a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no slogan at the verbal level, it is not a simple matter to kill the saints of the murderous god. Be sure. If it is well prepared, in his own environment, Chanem will either die or flee, and there is no third case. But in a hurry, this result is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's saint is a shrewd commander but unfortunately; a powerful barbarian can't be violent; or a shaman using mysterious power can't let go Surgery. He only has the power to be a warrior, but he can still stand in the end of the continuous elemental regiment. Siegel is not afraid of the power of the saints, but it will not be underestimated. At least one of Chanem’s words is quite right: I can control the situation is an illusion of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
