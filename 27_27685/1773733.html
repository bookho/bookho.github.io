			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't agree with your request, Mr. Edith." Siegel said: "First of all, it is difficult for me to improve the undead in three years. Spells to adapt to people other than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe in your ability to study spells, Heim is the best example." The Elf Master looks more confident than the party. “The elemental array here is amazing – I don’t mean how sophisticated or grand it is, but it opens up a new path to make the combination of elemental power and rune power a reality. The Master’s Association’s most fancy The quality of this person, their views also affect me. You have to be confident in yourself, Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mage still shook his head, Say to his predecessors: "Thank you for your trust, but I still can't promise you. Heim is still in the midst of war, and the Elves and the Masters Union will not be so fast, even if there is a wizard association. As a lord, I didn't have the energy to invest in the study of the Necromancer spells, because it didn't help the progress of the war. I don't want to find a variety of reasons to perfuse you after three years. Although this is just an exchange, But it contains human feelings, I can't ignore your help to me. Is it better to exchange something that I can provide immediately, in order to ask Druid to cast spells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Idis Rao Siegel's interest re-looked at, it seems askew empty skull can conjure up any new tricks. Then he smiled and then applauded gently, looking relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a stupid child, but an honest guy." Idis said: "I see it, it makes it difficult for you to promise a thing." , but you are the kind of person who will do it after the promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that I can be the kind of person you are talking about." Modest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf mage stood up and let his apprentices and assistants leave, so only two of them were left in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat quietly on the sofa, waiting for him to speak first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think the outcome of the war initiated by the elves this time? Do they have the possibility of winning?" Then he added: "To tell the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. So far, the elf is still the most successful." Siegel said: "Whether it is from the ability of the caster to fight or from the level of the army. The elves are in a stable position. The dwarves are closed to the country. The people of the New World, like the same sand, can't compete with the elves. But the Knox Association's grievances and their spells are very restrained in large-scale battles. At any time, you will lose your advantage - but the victory will still be in their hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are very awake." Idis said: "Get resistance After the evidence of the association between Knox and Knox, the Masters Association has decided to prevent Nexus from interfering with the world at any cost, including many actions across the plane. As we talked, there have been Several wizards set off, looking for Allies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis nodded, right Siegel said: "The spell you gave to the Masters Association. It is called the energy focusing lens, and it is also taken together by these wizards. If it really has good restraint to the Hins technology as you describe it, then You can get more rewards. Since you don't want to give me -- or can't give it to me -- the Necromancer, I want all the benefits that your energy can focus on the lens spell."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment and nodded his consent. "A spell for a spell, this is a fair deal. But I have a requirement, that is, the reincarnation must be successful, I don't want Janet to be in any danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I will make this happen, but it is not easy to impress the Druid," Idis said. "Druid is an elf, and elves and humans are still in the midst of war. Many things will be inconvenient. But as you said before, the elves have the advantage and the victory, but you have not surrendered until now. I can't help but The idea: Are you expecting something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf mage and Siegel look at each other. It seems to exchange views through sight. Why did Idis repeatedly mention war, did he mean something? As a half-elf, sandwiched between the two sides of the war, what would he think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly wanted to understand. Idis knew the power of the Mage Association to mobilize, and he saw the possibility of the elf failing. Therefore, I want to find a way out for some of the elves he cares about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one can understand the trend of the war. Maybe the situation will reverse one day. The previously insignificant little person may survive among the giants. Be the only winner to stand.” Siegel said: “I have no indescribable revenge on the elves. Heim’s collar can draw some places to shelter the free elves who are no longer participating in the war, as long as they respect me. The power of the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis reached out and Siegel shook it up. Negative energy and curse climbed the arm of the half-elf, but fortunately the time was short enough to melt his protective spells without causing substantial damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are really inconvenient in this state." The half-elf mage smiled. "I don't know what Caspar's expression is now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is expected to say, 'Why don't you die?'"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiss laughed, when he let go of his baggage, he really became happy: "Maybe he hasn't noticed, otherwise he will fall into a contradiction, and he will continue to maintain the spell. Run, or give up on this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does he send a consul of the Commonwealth to check the situation, or attack the city of Mire?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf wizard touched the beard. "You can't rule out this possibility. After all, he used even the big curse. You need to strengthen your defense recently, and the curse will last. Exposing your location, so you are staying in the library for a while, it’s safer here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, I also want to calm down and learn magic." Siegel said: "But I need to explain some things to Janet first, and she is worried about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "It's best not to be close to her. And absolutely avoid contact." The Half-Elf Master said: "The curse and negative energy on your body are likely to trigger the self-protection of the descent lineage and accelerate the rate of recovery of blood power. I will Don't worry about arranging reincarnation as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once again solemnly thanked Idis. Then walk out of the underground library to arrange the affairs of the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel, shrouded in a curse, could not appear in front of the knights and the inhabitants of the land, and the embarrassed look and the wicked smell of his body were enough to scare Everyone. The only one in the entire territory that is completely unaffected by the evil spirits is the Capricorn. The dragon body is much stronger than the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Dragon Girl is not interested in the bone shelf that will walk, because it does not allow her to improve her perception of space transmission. In Heim's collar this time. The high concentration of elements played a very important role in her growth, and Capricorn began to mature on the road from youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finds her through the raven, hoping that she will strengthen the defense of the territory in the recent period to prevent unidentified mages from approaching. Capricorn yawned and looked at her expression and didn't take it to her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons are all greedy, and Capricorn is considered to be better. Siegel took out the "Accurate Transfer Book" and promised to teach her the knowledge, which made the Dragon Girl pay attention to it. I have a real dragon to protect my wife and children. The Master is finally relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the time drags, the greater the pressure the elves will give to the federation, and the lower the likelihood that Caspar will send people, so It will be much better than the initial situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either internally or externally, there is only one calibre: the Lord of the Lord is making a rune, so that the elves can exchange for peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing day by day, Deepwater City and the elves have been deadlocked, and both sides are reluctant to sacrifice. So the federation couldn't attack, and the elf couldn't get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elves are not good at dealing with them, they must have done research on the Mage Federation. See the Three Peaks Tower's spell enchantment is strong. They also began to build a super-large magical array, surrounded by the deep water city. This array is very unique, and everyone in the federation has never seen anything similar in design and scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
