			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing to a higher place in the Magic Tower is the dream of every student, but it is very troublesome to achieve. The tampering lamp god concealed a lot of information, including how to use the points to get the right to go upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You only know that the person who gets the most points in each class may be allowed to go up to the second floor, and the person with the most points remaining every day can also. If you spend a hundred points, you can also be allowed to stay on the second floor for a whole day of study. But these are temporary methods, only one day at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that is concealed is how to obtain permanent access. Just go to the second floor ten times and then pay a hundred points, then you can go to the second floor at any time. Only if you get this right, then the third layer only needs twice the previous score, not ten times now. The original design is like this, so that everyone can go up one step at a time and build a solid foundation before they can continue to qualify for a permanent upper level. If this is not the case, each higher level must pay ten times more points than the previous level, and then you can temporarily stay for one day after being superimposed: no one can afford such a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who don’t believe, because they have all asked the god of lights and never received relevant information. Even if they said, "Tell me all the information about the right to permanent upstairs," the lamp god is just a cold answer: "Please explore on your own." This sentence misleads everyone, they think that they are not enough, so they can only waste their points over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna, you should have gone up more than ten times, spend a hundred points to apply for the lamp god."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairy nodded, and the hundred points were not too much. She naturally has this reserve. Although her lamp god still said "please explore on its own". However, she managed to successfully run this service for her. Anna looked at the triangular tattoo that appeared on her wrist. Know that you can go to the second floor at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first mover, the half-orc and the half-dragon mage also apply for the same qualifications, but the worm master lacks points because of the forced dismantling of the lamp god. Waiting later. The dwarf who was listening did not act. Because he had explicitly rejected Siegel before, he is now embarrassed to do this in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to go to the third floor now?" asked the elf who had the most points remaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can get points slowly, you can accumulate and always go up." Siegel's words made everyone feel at ease. There is no tension before the arrogance. It is always risky to launch an attack on someone else. If you are not careful, you will fold yourself inside. I once thought that only the one who survived will be the winner. Of course, this statement is also true. It is better than the success rate of step-by-step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the first step to make everyone’s relationship ease. On the one hand, Siegel doesn’t want to see the Master being misled by fratricidalism, and on the other hand has his own consider. "The good side is over. Now let's talk about the bad place. The servant's tampering is only one aspect. Although they are no longer friendly, they can still work normally. It is not so simple to tamper with the rules of the magic tower. It is very likely that everyone's efforts will be wasted and no one can win. I accept any challenge and are willing to work hard to overcome all difficulties and obstacles. Eliminate the enemy trying to obstruct, provided that the winning prize for this challenge can be paid! I can work hard. I can also accept the failure caused by my lack of ability, but I can't accept what should belong to me to be taken away! The purpose of everyone here is different, but I don't think there is anyone here who is here!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master snorted and said to Siegel: "You really are a lord. These words are entirely used to arouse the fighting routine. The knight and the lord should be useful, so don't use it on us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled, this irony is innocuous, maybe You can narrow the relationship. Only the wheelchair gnome blushes, and he almost has to shout and swear to fight the unfair situation. He took a few deep breaths, calmed himself down and stared at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who made the tampering? Who has such a great ability?" The question of the Semi-Dragon Master asked the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only mortals can come here, the saints will be very interested in this. Who can modify? Who else can there be in addition to the gods?" Er’s eyes swept across the faces of the people, and he did not forget his “companion”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen a world, a world of goblins. Because they don't compromise, they only know that one road is fighting, so they can't communicate. They don't think it's a dangerous situation, but they are very proud. No one likes it. They, even when they were wiped out, no one has mercy and almost no one has mercy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siglton took a moment, with a bitter smile on his face: "From I learned a lot about that thing. I know that only common goals and interests can unite different people. It is very difficult to succeed in their own wishful thinking. Everyone is a mage or more accurately, they are all I know how to plan and how to implement it, so I don’t talk nonsense. The thing I want to do is to unite everyone’s wisdom and change this magic school back to what it should be, and then everyone has the opportunity to rely on their skills. I am fighting for my own interests. I am willing to cooperate fully with everyone under this premise, I hope that you can join in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished these words and reached out The rotation around the head of the philosopher's stone. In the eyes of everyone, he placed the stone on the table in front of him. “Using this sage stone makes it easy to check out the Magic Tower library. If you have any questions, you can use it now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master Standing up, a flash appeared at the table and reached out to grab the Stone of the Sage. Everyone was shocked and made a defensive move. Only Siegel had no reaction at all, and looked at the Orcs with a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an artifact, an artifact that leads to knowledge, you don't feel bad?" The Orc released his hand and let the Stone of the Sage move around his head. "You are right, all of this is knowledge, and knowledge is power! Stone is mine, you don't want to take it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted his legs and walked outside, making a huge sneer while walking. The gnome is mad, but with a force on the armrest, a silver-white ball bounces out. Only a few loud bangs were heard, the ball quickly became bigger, the outer casing opened, and the strong robotic feet were extended from it. It took only a few seconds for a Mithril Golem to appear in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave something in your hand, that is not yours." The gnome slammed the wheelchair and shouted: "The Mithril Golem immunizes all magical effects. It can kill you without dying, even if you have the ability to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery Silver Golem? Good things, one-on-one How many things can beat it, even if the dragon can not guarantee a certain victory." The Orc Master looked back at the statue, and there was no trace of nervous expression on his face. "But can you be sure that this thing can hit me?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will make sure it can do this, even if it doesn't work, I still have a golem." The gnome pressed a few times in the wheelchair, from the side panel A dark groove full of grooves is opened, and eight metal balls of different colors are placed inside, emitting a fearful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master shook his head and said to the gnome: "The power of foreign objects is convenient, but it is not the right way. You can make your tall shovel Come and try, I can remove it with bare hands." He paused and his eyes moved to Siegel, then he said: "However, the Lord of this matter is this young mage. Let me take it. What is your thought about the Stone of Your Sage?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of foreign objects is convenient, but it is not the right way." Siegel returned the words of the half-orcs to him: "An artifact I can touch you, I think your eyes should not be so short. And what knowledge you say is power, it is actually 'you'? Power is power, how complicated is it for you? You think, if only Can you achieve your own goals in your own words?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc raised his eyes and a smile on his lips. Others can only understand the first half of the sentence, and the latter words are like a riddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked over to the murderer and placed his hand on his shoulder. Several black worms came out from under the robes and swam upstream of Siegel's back. The bald mage died after being drilled into the body, but Siegel did not seem to worry at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a magic school, and the strategy may still have some effect, but relying on brute force is definitely not going to be long-term, even if you have the power of almost God. You Don't cooperate with the Master, don't cooperate with the real Master, are you ready to go on holiday here? Don't take advantage of it, you will be defeated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Master suddenly Laughing, then grabbed the Stone of the Sage and threw it back directly. "You really have a vision and are qualified to be the leader. Regardless of your ultimate purpose, I have to share a piece!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
