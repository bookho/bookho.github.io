			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Evan does not work either. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundred-faced scorpion shot a beam of light and slammed the ring into the floor again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summons a dagger to make it wear a ring. Although it is easier to summon a little evil, Siegel never believes in the ethics of the underworld creatures. Although the dagger god is wearing the head of a hunting dog, it comes from the heavens. It is a natural samurai, which is the dead brain for pursuing kindness and order. Don't look at it's tall, strong, and the wings of a pair of swans, but the vows of goodness and justice can completely bind it. In other words, the mage does not have to worry about the decapitation of the gods and will run away with a ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical, the dagger god has enough intelligence to honestly and accurately describe his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Master, this ring is very interesting, there is no magic fluctuation, but it gives me a feeling full of powerful power." The dagger god squeezed Fist, grab your own giant sword with both hands, and twist it into a twist. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "The reason I do this is to restrain an impulse." mastiff first God said: "After wearing the ring, I particularly wanted to hit you two Personal, that kind of fierce and inhumane temper. But I know very well that this kind of thinking is wrong. Mr. Master, your ring is weird. I am from heaven, bathing in the light of kindness and order, so resisting evil thoughts. The ability is very strong. But if this ring is in the hands of other people, the result is hard to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, God, I have a The question is to ask you.” Siegel pointed to the ring and said: “After wearing it, do you want to slap other people’s impulses. For example, some orc, goblin or little demon?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the gods thought about it, then shook his head. "There is no special thought, it is still the same as before. We hate evil creatures, but what hates them more is their evil behavior, not violence. The way and boundaries of punishing evils are not changed by the ring." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your assistance, I probably understand." Siegel found a black dragon's keel from the space bag and gave it to the dagger god as a gift. Make. The dagger god returned the ring to the mage, and then the keel disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the ring with a serious look. Then patted Evan's shoulder and pointed to the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan seems to be aware of nothing, no jokes. "Let's say, is there any bad news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad is not good. But this thing starts to get weird." Siegel said to Evan. "The wearer of the ring will become stronger, and then there will be two thoughts that hurt us. For the gods, there is no reason to slap a treatment that is already very violent, if other people, For example, a ferocious orc, a eater, etc. The only thought in the brain is to kill two of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The better guess is because we bothered everyone's sleep in this room, so the ring wanted to retaliate." Siegel continued: "But I am more A tendency to be worse: the target of this ring is the scorpion, the scorpion that you and I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense, I agree with you. Let's wear it. The reason for the ring is also related to the scorpion.” Avon nodded: “The thing is designed to destroy the owner of the scorpion. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very possible at the moment." Siegel’s forehead, he only felt that his mind was not enough, and the blood vessels jumped under the skin. . "No one can give a ring. We should never have found this thing. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion." Evan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the ring shows some information under the flame, where the numbers 4, 6, and 8 have turned black. The remaining 10, 12, 20, and 100 According to what I know, there are four scorpions in the world, I am twenty, you are one hundred. Then the remaining two are probably ten and twelve."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if it is the scorpion made by the gods of the thunder wall continent. So why is there a ring in the writer's camp? What is the relationship between the two? What happened to 4, 6, and 8? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Siegel’s tangled thinking, Evan leaned forward. “In my opinion, you don’t even think about it. After all, the ring It is what we found. The danger is controlled. This is already very lucky. As for what hidden history is hidden behind it, what is the relationship? It is not an urgent matter."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks more than Evan, but he also has to agree with Evan: "Although it is not my style to wait for things to come, I don’t really dig down now. The ability. Unless we can find more information and evidence, everything is still only in the stage of conjecture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It is more important than thinking! Let's move on." Evan jumped up from the seat and patted the dust on his trousers: "There are some places that haven't been seen yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They continue on the road and open several closed rooms, but there is no such thing as "sudden dusting". Two people can basically be sure that this is not a refuge, but a workshop to make something. They found some kits that work with the parts on the board. These things gave Siegel a great inspiration and gave him some ideas for improving the pipeline. Unfortunately, the tool itself has been rusted and can no longer be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything here is destroyed by time, and nothing in the end is artificially resistant to the passage of time. Maybe people here want to record their information, but they can't find a better way. So the two explorers did not find paper, more metal plates, and even no runes on the walls and ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are doing it completely." Siegel said: "It's clean, there is nothing in the text."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly why I hate it." Evan, with a long sword, keeps looking around and still vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are so nervous now? Is there any danger here?" Siegel waved his staff and opened the last door at the end of the corridor to see the big inside. Small and small shelves should be a storage room. "Look, this is the last room. It's exactly the same as the front. The things inside are not broken or rotted. The dust won't come over and bite you. Put the sword away."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan has shaken his head firmly: "Siegel, you have to listen to me on this matter. I can predict that there will be fighting, and that is very interesting. The challenge, this hunch has never been missed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you have this ability? After getting the scorpion?" Siegel Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I have been since I was a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon talks about this kind of hunch The history of abilities, accompanied by exciting battles every time. He has trained his martial arts from time to time and has improved his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The starry kingdom is famous for its swordsmanship. The New World is like a barren desert." Avon waved his hand forward. To strengthen your tone. "Like Beneda Tampaton. The nickname of the city gate, good at one sword and one spear cross defense and sudden counterattack, very powerful; Danser Jakewood, nickname dancer, flexible, using daggers When the opponent is using a long weapon, there is no way to counterattack; there is also the famous Soth Wywood, the chief coach of the Royal Forest Guard, the nickname virgin..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Virgin? Is there such a nickname?" Siegel said with a smile: "Is he the kind of person who looks very beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. To be honest, his mouth is awkward, his eyes are not right, and his appearance is not good." Evan said: "But his skill in using sword shield is very strong, experience a few Hundreds of battles, very little injury. Occasionally, it was only a slight bruise, never passed through the blood, so I got a virgin nickname. Is his battle number soaring to a thousand?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is awe-inspiring, and people like this must have extraordinary skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many excellent swordsmen outside the Starry Royal Family, and there are also many knights. They have their own characteristics. There are many gains in dealing with them." Evan looks Siegel, very sincerely said to him: "The New World is a good place, only here can have the opportunity to build a large territory like the Heim collar, but you should go to the starry kingdom to see something. What is called a strong like a cloud. You are a mage, you have to go to the Masters Association? The New World Masters Federation is finished, you can't stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
