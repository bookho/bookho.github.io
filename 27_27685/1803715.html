			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of talk, the castle's knight gradually took up his weapon and returned to the state of alert. Segal and his party were able to sit down with the countess again and say what they wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess Ferrara holds her eldest son, Caster Biel, and comforts her hair. The little boy inherited his father's sky blue eyes and his mother's tawny hair, from panic to curiosity. However, the attitude of the countess has not changed much, she still claims that there is nothing left by Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he left, he was stunned. Never look for him, no one should go." The countess was very determined and kept shaking her head. "The Marquis of Siegel, I am very grateful to you for letting His Majesty the King rid the suspicion of Bill, but..." She glanced at the wiki and looked a little hesitant: "He said it was to protect me and my children, to avoid trouble. We, so only so. He probably doesn't want to be found by you, Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to tell you, Countess." He organized a speech and then slowly said: "No matter what danger or trouble I have encountered, Sir, I have to help him. He is like a father to me, so I will never stand by. And please believe that no matter what he is, I can take him out of trouble. There is no mountain that can't be turned over, but only time is tight. I want to save him, not to arrest or hurt him. The wiki is also here to help me, you can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence manager nodded and said: "The King’s Majesty did not order the arrest of Sir Bill. Even even Sir Bill is really a treason. As long as he does not repeat the crime in the future, this time he can also be forgiven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this, the countess’s eyes have a glimpse of it, this is The thing that makes Siegel frown the most. Did Sir Bill really choose to overthrow Evan, the king he once helped, supported and championed? Siegel can use his influence to persuade Evan to do it next time, but there is no guarantee that the next time he can do so. So the time is very tight, you must quickly find Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess of Ferrara was shaking her lips and wanted to say something, but the child in her arms moved. Let her lose her courage again – or the courage to take risks. "Let's go, I don't welcome friends who have abandoned our negative people. Although I have no ability to expel you, you are not welcome here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After she finished, Siegel was silent for a long time. He lowered his eyes and motionless, as if he was asleep. When Jack's hand touched the hilt, he seemed to feel wrong and lifted his nose. Others didn't move, and the whole scene was like stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. Caster Bill was impatient in his mother's arms and said, "Mom, they are not bad people, are they? But why don't they leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We are not bad guys, little guys, to some extent you should be grateful for this." Siegel suddenly stood up, the power of the element burning like a flame in his eyes, the shadow obscured half a room, the sound Like thunder. "If I am a bad person, I can knock over the whole castle. Come and get what I want! I can take blood from your two children for blood tracking! I can go deep into your mind and memory and tap whatever I want. The information I want! I can summon the devil and the demon to track his breath! Even if he is already dead, I can use the ghosts and ghosts to dig him out of the corpse!" The people panicked back, and Siegel Suppress your own anger, let the flames of elements and twists disappear, and let the room return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I am not a bad person, I have a self-made. I will not do the above." He shook his head and said: "But the bad guys will, maybe do it." Worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to help," he finally said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby in the cries is crying, and Custer rushes to marry him. The tears of Countess Ferrara could not stop flowing, and weeping with our mouths. Siegel decided to wait another minute. If the countess still does not help, then he will use his own methods to achieve the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he not be angry? The book of His Majesty the King has been down. The news of Siegel in the Star Fortress is almost universally known. But Sir Bill is still not showing up for half a month. He must be in great trouble. If the countess does not help, that's fine. Since she has divorced the jazz, there is no direct relationship now. Siegel respected her only because she was the wife of Sir Bill, not the countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Siegel used her care of her husband to kill her will. Sir Bill has a self-portrait that is discarded because his skills are too bad. However, the countess secretly collected and wanted to remain a memorial. This is the best thing to use to locate the jazz. It belongs to the jazz and is his understanding of the self. Using the spell, Siegel knows that Bill is in Swan Castle, and this location is not far from the horror castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swan Castle?" Wiki said: "As far as I know, there will be a group of insurgents in Swan Castle recently, but they have not received Sir Bill. Secret report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gave him a look and nodded, the meaning of which is self-evident. His Majesty is the head of the insurgents who are loyal to the loyalty, so the agents have been investigating everywhere. Swan Castle has become a trap, just don't know when it will close the net. Since the wiki now says that there is no Sir Bill, then this information has not yet reached the king. This is the only chance to pull the jazz out of the quagmire, perhaps the last chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it is not too late, we will leave immediately." Siegel said: "Ms. Shelley, how are you staying here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, can't you go to see the excitement?" The chief of the Necromancer shook his head: "Don't worry, I can take care of myself. You can use elemental guards, and I carry one with you." "The army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will arrange for you to be a martial artist. His martial arts is good, and the last line of defense can reassure me." Then Siegel turned Head to the King’s Intelligence Director: “How are we going to work together?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can feel at ease to appreciate the power of the Marquis." Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swan Castle is not too far from their current location, and Master Shelley has been there to explain the castle and the surrounding terrain. He used illusion to show everyone the appearance of Sir Bill, in case of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The walls of Swan Castle have dwarf runes and cannot be transferred directly." Siegel changed the spell. Everyone will be brought to the star number. The magic spacecraft immediately took off, and when it rose to the sky, it opened the faint fog, flying like a cloud of clouds at dusk to Swan Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castles that can ask the dwarves to make the Rune Wall are historically long, most of which were built four or five hundred years ago. The relationship between humans and dwarves is relatively intimate. At that time, there was no New World. The dwarves had insufficient living space, a large population, and even had two famines. Many dwarves were forced to leave the palaces in the mountains and show their craftsmanship in the human world. So I left a lot of Rune Castles. Even in the period just discovered in the New World, in order to support the construction of the Mora, the dwarves also received a lot of food aid by helping to build the castle's defense chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these castles generally have weaknesses, and their dwarf rune array is not complete. For example, the city of Miru is also based on the dwarf rune matrix, but its core is deep underground, and the runes on the wall only serve to transfer the energy and reinforcement of the earth elements. This is the result of the dedication of the dwarf Rune Master. Some castles in the Eastern Continent, such as Swan Castle, its anti-transmission rune matrix relies on several dwarf totem poles on all sides of the wall. Form a set of interference and detection in one battle. These rune columns can withstand wind, sun and rain for a long time, and weapons such as trebuchets can't hurt them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting late, the sunset is only the last touch of light yellow light, this time no one will pay attention to the dark clouds floating in the sky. The star is gently slid over the swan castle, and the entire view of the building is unobstructed. This is a very standard six-roofed castle. There is only one uphill road that can accommodate two carriages side by side. The other direction is combined with the cliffs and cliffs. In the past, if you wanted to capture this, you need to use a corpse to cover the only road, but the times have changed, and the towering walls have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is heavily guarded here. At least forty soldiers patrolled the wall, which is not the guards of the courtyard and the gates. Swan Castle belongs to the Duke Lutheran III, a veteran duke with a very low-key, old-fashioned and non-existent sense. The history of their family... It doesn't make much sense to say it, at least in the face of a magical spaceship. The sense of history has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repositioning, Siegel said: "The position of Sir Bill has not changed at all, it is a bit strange, maybe he was imprisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so too, which explains why my agent can't find him. So I think it would be more appropriate to define this action as a rescue operation. "Wiki Tancheng: "The Marquis, I can fully cooperate with your actions. But on the King's side, I have to report it truthfully. As for the former parliament, you don't need to know the result, you just have to look at the meaning of your majesty. But I think, considering The Marquis adults and friends took the initiative to help the king clean up the apostles, and things will go smoothly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
