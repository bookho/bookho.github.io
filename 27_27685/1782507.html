Magic equipment, which weapon is good for tangling. They have chosen the armor and are being assisted by the attendant to try Moore. When the mage heard the guard, he read a spell. The outside elemental rune guard received an order to deal with the wrapped "adventurer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon is playing with a pair of ice swords and tapping his hair to try its sharpness. He shook his head and said uncomfortably: "Let them hang there. Just wait for no time to call for help, then let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After all Is it to participate in the contest, and waste the spirit to listen to those who mourn?" Siegel slammed the hammer in his hand, and after it was thrown out, it would automatically return to his hand. It is a pity that there is no flame power like Eileen's Warhammer, otherwise it is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I observed it during the day, people here rarely have thick armor, the best is just a chain armor, so there is no need to choose a hammer like this Weapons." Avon sat back in the chair, tilting his foot on the table, and resting his hand behind his head. "They mostly use slashing weapons like swords, so in this case, the combination of sword shields would be more appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Head, agree with his statement, then add: "Prepare a few throwing weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol knocks on his breastplate, drawn on it The pattern of wings seems to swing slightly. As long as you read the secret language, this armor will give birth to the wings and fly to the sky with Moore. The starting point sergeant felt that this could be considered cheating, but Heim’s big lord thought it was the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Heim has a special product called Lianfa Crossbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At first I thought it was fighting Nata, and the result suddenly became the top ten and Nata." Mohr scratched his head. Adjusted the position of the armor. It can be seen that he is still very nervous. "Is it because she is not feeling well? She used to like the fighting challenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evanhaha laughed. Siegel also smiles. "Not because she likes you. Prepare to fight with you in the final battle. Come to a two-person to nine-person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I expected it to be correct If so, the movements caused by us are big enough. You will send someone to ask for it tomorrow morning.” Siegel looked at Fazak and said, “This time I have a chance to see what Nata looks like,” Can't you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go, I will wait for her to come see me." Fitzak waved his hand and drank slowly with the tea. The transfer technique made him dizzy. It is still recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes looked at Evan, who shook his head: “They should all come to see me, I will not go.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, Moore, you go with the guards, I continue to be in the camp." Siegel yawned, "If you pick it up, try it, I Going to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the Dio Chief did not invite the lord of the starting point, but wanted to see the wizard who cast the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the honorable magician can appreciate the light", they are very polite. Then add the phrase "If the Sorcerer is inconvenient to travel, I also hope to give the chiefs the opportunity to visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not want to expose himself in front of Moore Information that is familiar with Dio. Then he could not let him come, only he passed. He unloaded the breastplate and blouse belonging to the lord, put on the robe of the mage, and took the defensive staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem protecting myself, and my current status is not your superior lord, just an ordinary sergeant, so don't give me a guard tomorrow. Said Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol sees the people around him, a "King of the King" pretends to be a swordsman, and a "Lord Lord" plays as a consultant mage, leading to his own situation. It has become very subtle. Coupled with his grandfather Fazak, he must obey the words he said, so the line looks like his own position is the lowest - of course, in addition to the accompanying guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can you say? In nominal terms, the "supreme sergeant" of the entire team can only obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no rough grassland, nor the solid weight of the dwarf, and the solemnity of the human lord can not be found. There are thick carpets and large, low stools. Each stool has a beautifully decorated low table in front of it. It is filled with nuts, ham and cheese in a shiny silver plate. There are ale, honey and kumiss next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the big account is lit with incense, and a few maids wearing voile and blouse stand by and gently fan the incense with a small fan, if not The smoke sent a strong scent. In the center of the big account is a huge horn, black and shiny, decorated with gold patterns. This horn is very difficult for people to blow. Maybe a strong man like Giant Kerry is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical radiance is emitted from the horn, but the effect is not seen by the eyes alone. Siegel looked at the decoration of the entire account and always felt familiar. When Dio's hearty laughter sounded, he was shocked: this is very close to the style of "a hotel" at the top of Mora! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dio, why do you decorate the big account like this?" Siegel's laughter overshadowed the chief. I saw that the strong man opened the curtain and rushed in, staring at Siegel's face for a few seconds, then slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, are you?! How come you came here?" He shook his shoulders and shook his shoulders. On the chair, sitting cross-legged opposite him. "I haven't seen you for a long time. Look at your good looks! It turned out to be a mage. It looks so handsome! I listened to the brethren outside. The big group of fog in the camp is what you got out of it? Great! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dio, your look is good, still the same strong!" Siegel is also very happy, pinching the muscles of the barbarian arm. "I have long wanted to see you here. This is not. I have only recently found a good opportunity. Are you not holding a contest for marrying your daughter? I still have to work together for this excitement."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diou frowned and said, "Isn't it better to be with you than my daughter?" He squeaked his fist and his muscles squirmed under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not me, I am accompanying others, the leader of the starting point, Moore. I used to be my knight attendant. Now it is my loyal lord." Gore slightly hides. Avoid the threat of muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio slammed his fist into the palm of the other hand and made a bang. "This is Moore! Seduce my daughter, did you teach it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think about it!" Siegel snorted "Who did I teach? Who remembered it at the top of Mora, you have to ask me to go to that kind of place, you have forgotten it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dio squinted his eyes: "You, you! Do you want to twitch you, I teach you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't always pull someone else Look at your big account, like the kind of place. So the root of all this is still on you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On mouth and care, I said that you are a mage! But even if we are friends, don't think about me, I will find some beautiful prairie girls for you!" Dio sipped a sip on the ground and said: "I am ungrateful, I decided not to marry my daughter. In the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moore will take your daughter back with the soldiers at the starting point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Impossible, I have explored Only a few people at the starting point of the outpost can have five hundred? I have two thousand and five hundred troops. When his soldiers come out, they will be eaten by my tribe in the wild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You estimate the same. But don't forget, my Heim has five thousand elite soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Prairie Don't suffer. Tens of thousands of people still come together." Dio squeezed his chin and said with a smile: "So, I want to agree with this affair and think about other ways?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to use other methods? I don't need to be in trouble." Siegel returned with a confident smile: "I took Moore, used the spell, and sent it in, Find your daughter, and then just take her with you and leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nata will not walk with you!" Dio said: "She is My daughter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
