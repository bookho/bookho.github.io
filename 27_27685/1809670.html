			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord likes rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quickly became a joke in the city of Mith, then the entire Heim collar. "For the rabbit!" instead of "for the health of the Lord" became the most common toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord’s Office did not stop this matter. After hearing the news, Siegel said: “It’s nothing to make them jokes. Even if you stop this, can you still Stop the next one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Siegel’s management of Heim’s collar has always been the same, and no matter what matters, it is handed over to the small parliament and the people. Yourself. The largest population of Heim’s collar is still a peasant, and Siegel has taken a considerable portion of the gold coins earned by the workshop to subsidize food production, build water conservancy and equip the magical tools, which reduces the worries for the farmers and allows Heim. The villages that are led are much richer than the ordinary villages of the Starry Kingdom. If you have money, you have the means to hire adventurers and mercenaries to deal with simple problems, such as beasts around the village, or wandering undead. As for the robbery gangs of the kobolds and the orcs, most of them do not use the army of the various lords to solve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The booming mercenary industry has increased the demand for weapons and armor, which has given Heim’s workshop a lot of income. Thanks to the combination of the Miereng nuclear and the higher creations, the production of the workshop is constantly increasing, and all products belong to the lord, which provides a long-lasting wealth for Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive cheap products impact the market of the starry kingdom, and many lords complain and have fun. Although wealth continues to gather at Heim, the overall level of human equipment has increased at a very low cost, and soon surpassed the elves and dwarves. Evan also saw this, only to let Siegel sell a lot of weapons and armor, and even the star royal family is still one of the biggest buyers. Evan is very clear. It is impossible to stop the production capacity of Heim. The only choice is to profit from it. Don't be left alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no way to return to Heim’s Siegel. After hearing about the things that Siegel did to the Master Tower of the Masters Association, His Majesty the King also knew. This is a way for Siegel to vent their dissatisfaction. He took back the hundred-faced scorpion, and the Masters Association also launched the action against the goblin, but compared to let Siegel leave the star city and leave his side. Is the value not worth it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will wake up with this question every day, and then take this question to practice the sword before breakfast. The number of hundred-faced scorpions has recently declined, and it has not reached the original highest record. It is always around sixty. Evan understands that he has regressed, and retreating means weakness. It is a fatal weakness for the king and the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the news he got, Siegel’s return to Heim’s collar, in addition to the dispute over the arbitration territory, was a boring study of spells. This is in everyone's expectation, after all, many of the magic scrolls he got from the Tongtian Tower, these have to be transformed into strength. A lord who has become a sergeant is still constantly improving his strength, which is a stimulus for His Majesty the King. Can you beat him with his own sword? Can you deal with his magic ship with his army? He heard that when Siegel went all out, he only returned to the city of Mirius from the Tongtian Tower in half an hour, and defeated the original Lions of the Federation, the current witch, with unstoppable power. Demon Alexander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avon has a sense of crisis, he realizes that Heim’s collar has enough strength to get out of the control of the starry kingdom, just like a horse running too fast. Will be out of the reins. Just like the four-wheeled carriage of the Star Kingdom. He also realized that the Masters Association, which can be regarded as an opponent by Heim, has the power to be above the starry royal family, but how has the kingdom maintained its rule for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously impossible to rely on loose, independent lords, relying on long swords and steel armor is even more delusional. Even if there are magical spaceships and Griffin Legion, it will not play a role in real combat. Evanmo glared at the scorpion, thinking about what he had done before the king in order to maintain his rule, and found that they all fell into a misunderstanding: there is such a big hidden danger, but it has been turned a blind eye. Why is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the last Master’s lord had problems, the Star Royals should gradually weaken and control the Masters Association, instead of allowing the Association’s subordinate organizations to slowly infiltrate This anomaly caught his attention. He suddenly thought of one thing. What Sigel once said to him: Everyone in the world knows the wall of the storm, and regards it as a normal phenomenon. Even the wizards who have gone through the same world rarely and completely annihilate it. The storm is linked, which is not normal in itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can the Star Kingdom start to counter the Masters Association and the City of Learning? Evan put down the sword in his hand and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another continent, Siegel worked day and night. He wants to learn advanced spells and study the Lord of the Rings at the same time, and he wants to divide himself into eight people. In order to save time, in addition to attending the meeting of the lord, Siegel has always maintained a sly form, using the power of undead to reduce sleep. This allowed him to spend half the time studying to work than normal, but only half of the extra time was still insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to add more time, he conducted a "crazy" experiment. When launching a virtual cannon, there is a key step in oscillating time and space to generate more acceleration time and acceleration length. This kind of acceleration is temporary, and the modified inertia of time and space will make up for this part of the shock, use shortening to deal with the extension, and use expansion to compensate for the collapse. However, as a warhead, it did get an "extra time", and Siegel wanted to use this method to get extra time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He isolated part of an arrow tower in the castle of Mire, prohibiting everyone from entering and leaving the area and is isolated by a complex magical array. With the knowledge of the "time-pause" spell and the power back of the Peruvian nuclear, he began to oscillate the time in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to completely stop the time in this area, but it is possible to make it different from the surrounding time flow to a certain extent. It's like a pair of springs with time. The more you pull, the longer you stick, and the more extra time you get. Then you can enjoy the stolen time as long as you leave the area before the spring rebounds. At the beginning, Siegel could only steal more than a dozen seconds, which was not enough to prepare for the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing this. Siegel will be exhausted. This is not physical discomfort, but mental fatigue, which is the burden of manipulating time and space. He is already close to the power of manipulating the rules and is the means to build legendary spells. But legendary spells are also difficult. The hardest part of it is the time-related spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also thought of this. If you follow the method from easy to difficult, his first choice should be an elemental spell, such as the four-pulse rainstorm. However, his need for time is too urgent, and this method is also the best to exercise his spell control, so Siegel insisted on his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a week from ten seconds to one minute. It took another half a month from one minute to ten minutes. Siegel finally realized that he gradually found a way and a trick, and he began to get his hands on it, and progress has also advanced by leaps and bounds. It took another half a month, and he could steal two hours each time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in these two hours, it takes an hour to just meditate and restore the spirit. The rest of the time is too late to do magic experiments, look at the spell book, check the information is slightly insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this greatly improves Siegel’s cast level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he tried to take the time to improve his strength, Lear’s previous layout began to show its effects. The all-out war between Deepwater City and the Jackdaw Tribe was on the verge of a sudden, and in fact a small-scale battle has begun. Both sides understand the moment when they must decide the outcome. Siegel tried to mediate the two sides, but where would things be as easy as he thought? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is willing to pause and explain the opportunity to Deepwater City, but Siegel’s prestige in Deepwater City is very inadequate, and the People’s Assembly of Deepwater City simply ignores it. The messenger of Heim's collar. There is no positive answer at all, and it is said that Heim’s Siegel’s intention is to go beyond the star king and ask about other territories. The matter of returning to the starry kingdom in Deepwater City has not yet been completed. The royal family has not sent a lord to manage it. They have already lived in the territory of the starry kingdom. It seems that the intention of dragging the jackdaw into the war has been decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where they are coming from. But it is likely that the Masters Association is behind the support. The synagogue of the Federation heard the news and wanted to share the worry for Siegel. It was suggested that the magic ship return to the Three Peaks Tower. Although it is in ruins, it is still the land of the federation. As long as the magic ship arrives. Regardless of how the Masters Association helped Deepwater City, the outcome of this battle will be mastered in the hands of the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also thought it was a good idea at first, and it didn’t necessarily have to be fighting. It only needed the spacecraft to arrive and express his attitude. It is possible Avoid this war. Janet also reminded him: "The goal of Lear and the Masters Association has never been the Deepwater City and the Jackdaw Tribe. It is the Heim Collar and the Masters Federation. When the magic ship leaves the city of Myrtle, leaving your Siegel Protection, it is likely to be targeted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
