			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no point, Siegel can only leave the fourth layer of countless magic items with empty hands. When he came to the fifth floor, he found that it was an empty, unadorned place, but placed a huge transparent crystal ball in the center of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no guardians in the room, and there are no management and commentators like the six-armed god. In addition to Sigel, the only thing that can move is the shadow of the crystal ball. One is the reflected Siegel, the other is the transmitted Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description is very accurate, reflecting and transmitting is Siegel, not the old camouflage body Oluoin Courin. Siegel has not seen his original appearance in the mirror for a long time, and now he is somewhat moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal balls are often used as props for foresight and divination, and are also useful in situations where extra long distance casting is required. Dr. Faranis is a master in this area, but his apprentices have not been able to learn this from him, including Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has superb comprehension and control over elemental spells, prophecy is a weakness of Siegel. However, this should have nothing to do with the qualifications of the individual, but some kind of precautionary mechanism left by the magic god. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why there are only one prophecy master among so many wizards in the world, and this person is always Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can find the answer here. With this idea, Siegel approached the crystal ball and tried to get closer. His two shadows gradually approached and slowly began to coincide, and he did not feel that there was anything wrong with this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear certainly left behind here, and it would not be easy to get the knowledge and power of prophecy. In his view, the power of prophecy is stronger than magic, because as long as you master the future, you have everything. This crystal ball is a prophecy spell artifact, which is made up of the power of the gods and the legendary spells. It is by relying on this thing that Lear can cast spells on the position below the nebula, including prophetic spells that never fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know the secret of the prophecy crystal must be close, and this will make the two projections one. When this happens, the trap left by Lear will start. Create a replica like a mortal enemy mirror, and start chasing the body. It's just that this replica has the resources of the entire magic tower: four layers of magical equipment, the army of structures, necroons and elements, and the three layers can reach the transfer map of any known location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal enemy mirror can only create a replica. And predicting the crystal ball can create countless. As long as this person has a future - he has not yet died - then the crystal ball will start again every few minutes. The pursuit of killing is endless, until the possibility of an individual is ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not know that his future will be destined to be ended, but the blind man knows. An early five-second warning suddenly appeared in Siegel's mind. He saw his end after touching the crystal ball and immediately retreated. The two projections reluctantly retreated away. Did not be able to get together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good risk, almost in the middle of the stroke!" Siegel had a sigh of breath and looked at the crystal ball and frowned. The first three layers were safe and sound, and he relaxed his vigilance. This room, which has nothing but a giant crystal ball, is less like a trap. Collier used this kind of thinking to set the trap. I don't know if there are other people who have been to this room. Are they killed by their own avatars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the power of four arrows and elemental aggregates that cannot be replicated, replicas of all artifacts are still not well dealt with. A safer approach is to leave directly and go up to the sixth floor. But Siegel’s instinct tells him that this crystal ball hides a major secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most troublesome thing about Lear is not his wisdom. He is indeed calculating and calculating the various minds of the Master, but it only makes him an excellent strategy tactical setter. The key to truly making him invincible is the ability to prophesy. It is the grasp of the future. On the stone boat, Lear tried to modify the future and replaced the reality with a certain possibility. This power goes beyond the rules, and even the legendary spells can't do this. It is still possible to modify the past through time travel, although it is difficult. It is possible to replace the path of time with something that has not happened. This kind of power can only be done by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, Lear should have given up his priesthood and fire, and chose to be a mortal. It is true that his body has the characteristics of the saints and is far stronger and stronger than ordinary people. But this does not allow him to have the power of God. So when he uses the replacement reality, he must borrow other forces, and the source of this power, the biggest possibility is in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both shadows come from a peep into the future, not simply made up of light, so Siegel's attempt to shield the shadows by the darkness has failed. Stealth has no effect. With two projections, there are three "self" in the room. The old white robe that reveals the true nature and age, a clear and perfect young Lord of the Marquis, and a lord of the Marquis who is distorted and swelled by transmission. The three Siegels moved around the crystal ball in the room, and once Siegel approached the crystal ball, they gathered in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detection spell of the long-distance cast will not be able to touch the crystal ball, and the non-detective spell will pass directly from the center of the crystal ball. Like passing through a phantom. The future can be hurt, but in the future it will only become true if you experience it yourself. Siegel changed his strategy and used his metamorphosis to extend his arm. He immediately gave up trying to use the long arm to touch the spell, because it would still make the shadows close to each other and coincide at the point of contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, I can’t think of any good ideas. I can only shake my head and give up temporarily. He boarded the steps to the sixth floor and was eager to see different scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he perceives is not the scenery, but a howl, and then one after another, with countless screams. Above the steps is a vast expanse of grassland, the breeze blowing the yellow thatch, bringing out a wave of waves. The top of the head is a clear blue cloudless sky. Looking up and looking at the roof and walls, there are only countless creatures wandering here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is flying dragons, the colors are complete, the variety is rich, they are sprinkled with strong elemental fluctuations, Longwei is also doped among them. Flying with them is the Thunderbird, the whale-eating creature's wingspan longer than the three-sea boat, which can summon the thunder in the sky and attack any hostile creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the hairy balloons float up and down, the central big eyes and the surrounding small eye stems are all closed, seemingly still asleep; able to emit acid The eagle of the liquid arrow, the cluster of blood-sucking mosquitoes that can hypnotize, and after seeing Siegel, they rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will definitely be late because the monsters on the ground are closer. The petrified light from Medusa and the dead rays of the sacral Naga hit Siegel's defensive barrier, which was then covered by fireballs and ice storms. In the first place, there are dozens of different magic skulls that are launched to Siegel, and there will be more and more. The entire sixth layer is all creatures that can use magical power, flying in the sky, running on the ground, and maybe there is water swimming. They treat anyone who comes from the bottom layer as an adversary or prey, and do not use their abilities. When any mage is faced with such a large-scale biome, it is only a matter of time to be defeated and killed. The gap between the numbers is too great, even if it is a legendary spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel only had a look at the outcrop, and the magic protection on his body was broken by two layers. He hurried down the stairs and returned to the fifth floor room with only the crystal ball. Each layer here is like a space that does not interfere with each other. Fortunately, because of this, those creatures will not catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unreasonable. If you go up, you will be chased. Which reward is this? Siegel thought of the fifth layer of the copy of the crystal ball, understand that the sixth layer was also moved by Lear. In the face of hundreds of various adult dragons, as well as a variety of other magical creatures, even the Holy One is only dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-second warning to avoid danger has been used here in the crystal ball, so I was not prompted after going upstairs. I can survive by relying on the usual protective spells and my keen reaction. If it is a few seconds later, when the attacks of the magic beasts come together, then they can only be revived by cloning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are risks everywhere, and it is not safe to rely solely on cloning. Siegel knows that he needs to stop and be prepared for the next move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes down to the fourth level of magic items, where he can learn how almost all magical equipment is made. At present, at least it is safe here, and other students should not come. The six-armed light god here seems to be the only logically normal and well-judged one in the entire magic school. For the time being, there are no signs of being tampered with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses the Sage of the Sage to connect to the library and ask about the sixth floor of the Magic Tower. He just found a slogan in the book of a magical school, saying that it is the wilderness of the magical beast, which is a perfect venue for the mage who studies the abilities of transfiguration, alien creatures and magical pets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
