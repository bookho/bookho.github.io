			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel turned into a cockroach and changed back, the original disguise was invalid, so he changed back to black and black eyes. The half-orc was originally hidden under the body, and saw Siegel from afar. This made a shouting voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw the half-orc, although surprised by this magical reunion, but now is not a question of fate script. A mad mad gladiator who was controlled by the mind rushed to Mike, and suddenly pressed against the half-orc, his hands clenched his throat. Zuck struggled, but his hands and feet were tied together by chains, very difficult to move, and the movements of pushing the enemy were awkward. Siegel’s hand threw the dragon’s dagger in the past, passing through a pair of orcs who were fighting, and accurately inserted into the heart of the mad slave, which resulted in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievances flew out of the dead body and tried to drill into the body of the scorpion half-orc. However, there seems to be a thin protective film on the body of the body, which exudes a faint silver radiance, and the grievances cannot be drilled. The half-orc is sweating and seems to be enduring intense pain. However, in the end, it was the grievances. After the black smoke became lighter, the grievances left the half-orcs and went to find other slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad half-orc’s body just happened to be in front of Mike. He pulled out the dagger from the back and cut off the shackles on his hands and feet. Then he jumped up and killed in the direction of Siegel. Zucker’s combat skills were developed during the battle with the beasts. Although rough, they are also brave and effective. The beasts attacked with their claws and teeth, and these mad slaves did too. Therefore, Zucker regards them as short bears. As long as they don't fall into the situation of directly competing with them, they can take advantage of the opportunity to cut their necks with daggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel on the other side of the room, the long chain as a whip, more comfortable. In order to better carry out the plan of the heart, he had to temporarily press and hold the idea of ​​using magic, and completely solve the battle with superb martial arts. In his hands, the chain is like having life, like a python attacking, quickly wrapped around the enemy's neck, and then strangled to death. Siegel quickly merged with the Musk half-orcs, and the two stood at a distance of two meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel noticed that the dagger in the hands of Mike was faintly pointing at himself, with a look of doubt and alert in his eyes. This is a clear footstep from outside the arena, and the orc's troops have arrived. The situation is very urgent and cannot afford more delays. So Siegel said a long story: "Zike, Linke betrayed me to the orc, then I killed him. You want to kill me now or want to escape? Make a choice!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc frowned, hesitating for a moment, the footsteps outside made him quickly determined. He opened his mouth, but it was not the voice of "Kick", but he spoke in a clumsy and unclear manner - he rarely spoke, so his ability to speak was getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save my people, I will forgive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s brains turn, I want to understand what is going on in an instant. In the bacon village, Zhong Kelin tried to plant the things that did not send troops to Siegel. After the failure of the arrest, he was imprisoned, but the stone village entered the sight of the orc generals. What happened later was nothing more than the orc army looking for the door, and the village of humans and half-orcs as a slave village, all caught Macabu. In some of them, some villagers may be hiding, and perhaps many are killed, but no matter how many survived, it is the place where the gram is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, 哼克, I will do my best." Siegel solemnly promised: "First tell me which is your slave owner?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad pointed to the ground, and the half-orc who had been pierced by Siegel’s throat was the “master” of the gram. Siegel crouched down and pulled his body over, putting his face up. He firmly remembered the appearance of this half-orc, and quickly printed his figure and physical features in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t let others pay attention to this." Siegel said to Mike: "And return the dagger to me after a while. This weapon continues to dress up the slave for you. The task is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Siegel listened carefully to the outside movement, and at the same time recalled the two spells that he was going to use in his heart. There were only two dying slaves in the channel, and the grievances abandoned them to the more peripheral room. Siegel listened to the ear and finally waited for the voice of the witchcraft to recite the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the detection of magic enchantments, the spells used by the wizard and the spells used by the witches are difficult to distinguish, although they belong to different sources of power, but they are formed. Energy fluctuations are very similar. After the witchcraft begins to cast spells, it is easy for Siegel to cast spells to cover up the past, and there is a great chance that it will not be traced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs the memory and knowledge of the slave masters on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading memory or exploring thoughts is a very deep spell, and Siegel is still unable to perform. However, there is a more brutal and bloody version in the Knox Synagogue's spell book. Unlike the exploration of the Confed Master, the common spells will destroy the brains of the subjects, damage their intelligence, and turn them into idiots. Because of this characteristic, the memory of the common society is a spell of evil by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is very aware of the nature of this spell and understands the meaning of doing it. He will not find various excuses to comfort himself and excuse his behavior; nor will he give up the spells by falsehood, affecting the advance plan, and causing himself and his companions in danger. He took a deep breath and said "I'm sorry" to the dead half-orc, and then pressed the palm of his hand to his forehead without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the conventional spell exploration idea is slow work, as if the hand is unlocked, then the memory is as rude as the door is opened. Since the subject has died, the wizard can only read the memory of the last period, but fortunately, the casting speed is very fast, and it can be completed before the witch festival arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witchcraft outside the room advances very fast. They just have a moment of rush when they first encounter the grievances, thinking that they are encountering a group of ghosts. Both have a smoky shape and a horrible face that can penetrate the entity and emit evil, but after all, it is not the same kind of undead. With the help of orc soldiers, the Witch Festival quickly discovered the weakness of this monster and called the power of the orc god to trap the evil souls. The Wraiths themselves are very low-attack and have no spell power. The only thing they rely on is the powerful possession and control characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard the sound of fighting outside and gradually stopped, knowing that the orcs had achieved the advantage of the scene and will soon be able to win. He took the time to search for a few pieces of information he needed, and then stopped the spell before the end of the battle, while dispelling the anti-evil spell. The half-orc slave owner who was smashed by memory, left a red palm print on his head, which is the trace left by the wizard's palm, as if the skin of the hand is hot with a soldering iron. Segel sighed and lifted the body of a half-orc next to him, smashing their two heads together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost the same as the power of Siegel's breastfeeding, the two heads are broken like watermelons, and the unbearable scenes cover the traces left by the spells. . At this time, Zucker also returned the dragon tooth dagger to Siegel, and asked him what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to be a slave to the gladiator," Siegel said: "I am dealing with the witches and soldiers of the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克 nodded, lying down against the wall, making a distraction look. Siegel finally checked his coat and then watched the orc soldiers rush into the door and rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel holds the dragon tooth dagger and shouts loudly: "For the benefit of General Kabu!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An orc warrior raised his hand is an arrow, close to a one-meter long feather arrow straight to the heart of Sigel. There is no hesitation in the battlefield, and the longbow is extremely deadly to those who are not prepared. Siegel knew that the orc was impulsive and reckless, and how could he not guard against the attack of the orcs after entering the door? With his skill, he can naturally avoid this feather arrow when he is prepared, let him pass through the space between his body and his armpit. But for a more realistic acting, he let his arm be brushed by a feather arrow, leaving a bloody wound. Then he yelled, dropped the dagger, and hurried to the ground, shouting: "Don't kill me, don't kill me! I am the steward of General Kab, not a slave of madness."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second orc soldier who rushed into the door was full of longbows, and the feathers again aimed at the heart of Siegel. At this time, an orc witch festival came in and used a mace to shift the direction of the longbow aiming and said in the orc language: "There is no ghost here, leaving a living mouth to ask what happened."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Guards put their long bows aside, but their hands have been placed on the long handle of the axe, ready to be on fire. The witch sacrifice went to Siegel. This is a strong and burly orc, standing barefoot in a pool of blood, wearing only a pair of large leather shorts. The muscle-expanding green body is full of black tattoos with swirls, flames and lightning patterns that spread from the navel to the chin. Two curved and thick fangs pointed from the corner of his mouth to the sky, and one of his eyelids was empty, in which the emblem of the orc god was placed. This is a tribute to the orc's one-eyed patron, only a devout and powerful witch offering is allowed to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
