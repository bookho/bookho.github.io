			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of making "the root of Mora", Siegel has greatly developed his ideas, and many combinations of runes and spells have emerged in his mind. good idea. The high manufacturing costs of magical items have always made them a luxury that only a few talents can use. Weakened spells can reduce the cost of consumption, but they have not solved the persistence problem. The dwarf runes are a good choice, combined with the gnome's circular illusion, which forms a very good combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to stay in the lab, immersed in the joy of inventions, but the things in the territory are urgently needed to be solved, and the study of the Golem is also on the agenda. So after a nap for a while, he and Fazak rode to the Striped Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he is no longer simply going through the "golden city wall", but carefully checking the construction of the Rune Arrow Tower. Each of the towers is composed of one hundred and eight dwarf runes, which can be self-excited in the face of evil creatures, forming the courage to defend against evil enchantments and inspire combat. The range is not large, it can only cover the city walls and the arrow tower, but it is enough to form effective protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every rune is clear and effective, and it is a perfect combination of strength and art. Siegel recited the spell and made these runes form an enchantment, and then felt it with heart. The surrounding magical enchantments are powerful, and it seems that the dwarves did not cut corners when they built the Rune Arrow Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel himself can also make permanent runes, although not as good as the dwarf's craftsmanship, but can also achieve a qualified level. He estimated the cost of materials for all runes. An arrow tower only needs a maximum of 12,000 gold coins, and the runes inlaid inside the walls are about 10,000 gold coins. He built a total of three Rune Arrow Towers, and he could not use more than 240,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fazak, where is the dwarf now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The passageway in the Walled Mountains The site, the Lord, "Fazak replied: "They are trying to dig through the rock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people walked down the tower and entered the middle of the long wall aisle. The passage is three meters wide and the height of the head allows the cavalry to pass. The dwarf designed the arched structure here and strengthened the support of the side wall with a strong column. If it is necessary to stack defensive machinery on the wall, such as a trebuchet or a brake, the weight can be shared. Does not affect the structure of the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some throwing holes in the wall that have a well-designed arc, which can only make people filled with asphalt, rough stones or Throwing a javelin and trying to climb in is impossible. In order to avoid fire. The dwarf illuminates the ceiling with luminous runes, which illuminate the entire passage as long as there is a sound around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the city wall passage is the mountain, and Siegel intends to build a underground road leading to the north from here. For the sake of safety, this passage did not communicate with the Streaky Gold Mine and bypassed St. Joseph West. After turning a corner, it extends northward. If it is not the help of the earth element rune escort, it will take a long time to complete such construction only by the dwarf's own excavation ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no decorative lighting rune yet, so Siegel shines with his wand and is filled with pale colors in the passage. The tunnel in the rock twists and turns, initially down, then up. Some places are difficult to cut, so there are many narrow roads that can suddenly become steep and difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak is getting older, and Siegel has turned him into a floating technique, which saves him some strength. They walked in the passage for half an hour. I finally heard the sound of the stone coming from the front. As the back and forth oscillate in the narrow passage, the monotonous snoring becomes blurred, like a weird whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, they finally joined the dwarf. There are four miners here, using the pickaxe to correct the passages excavated by the earth elements. The large basket of rocks and mud are stacked on one side, and the other side is the box containing the supplies. The dwarves saw Siegel, but they didn't stop their work. They still looked at the prominent rocks and made a sound of different lengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jobs don't really need the dwarfs, the earth elements can do better. The elements only need to be digging with their fingers and smoothing with the palm of their hand to reach the standard of the general masons. The dwarves are doing nothing, and they have no sweat. Not even tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rock. Where is the diamond?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to find it, I don't want to run the road." Siegel snorted and said: "You knock on the signal from the wall. I can understand, so you still tell me where the secret road is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf stunned and had to smile two times and said: "The Lord, wait a moment. Locke will explain the situation to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a glimmer came back with their steps. Locke covered the oil lamp, and the other hand held a warhammer, and the runes inlaid on it were grayish white. The dwarfs Grote and Mundock behind him were holding a shovel under his arm, holding the twisted iron dome cap with his hand and running over the footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock saw that Siegel had been sitting here, and the dwarf companion beside him kept glaring at him. The long-standing tacit understanding made him immediately understand what happened here. Locke looked at Siegel's face, very serious, but could not see other emotions. Look at the one-eyed old man Fizak, a look of nervous expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the gap between 240,000 and 40,000?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, and then he acknowledged it broadly: "Mr. Lord Fitzker, I think you are coming for the gold coins that Rune spends." We did use a lot of gold coins outside the Rune Arrow Tower and didn't want to tell you. But since you have already discovered it, we don't have to continue to hide it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We made a lot of runes, far more than the arrow tower needed, all used on this tunnel." Locke said: "But this involves a major secret of our dwarves, can not easily tell the outsiders. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my territory, my gold coin, I have to know their purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Lord, don't worry." Locke put down the hammer in his hand, and other dwarves also vacated their hands, indicating that they were not hostile. "We watched you climb the road to Mora through the road to the road. This is the second time you step on that road. Does it make any difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this related to the answer I want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Locke nodded, and the other dwarves looked at Siegel with a sly look. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s harder than the first time.” Siegel said: “On the one hand, I guessed the difficulty. I thought I could use magic, but I didn’t expect it. There is no elemental power on the road to the road. In addition to the things carried on the body, the space bag and magic equipment lose their effect, so it is more difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In addition, during the climbing process, I also suffered from ice attack,” Siegel thought for a moment and realized: “Is this thing related to you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Locke nodded. "We pray to the dwarf patron. I hope to get the revelation. We need to know whether the Westward is right or wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock look at Fazak and then to Siegel: "This thing can only be for dwarves Say, you are a brave man, naturally one can count, but this one-eyed old man can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know. It is gold. Secrets of use, rather than the dwarf. "Siegel shook his head, Locke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear by the dwarf patron saint and bloody sons, I will tell you everything you want to know." The dwarf insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other dwarves nodded. Siegel's gaze swept through their persevering faces, seeing the traces of the wind and blood, the scars that wrestled with the beasts and sought for a lifeline in the wilderness. These dwarves have a sense of honor and will not violate their vows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fazak, you retreat, I want to listen to them." Siegel reached out and said to him, "You go back first." Also, give me the books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man carefully looked at these dwarves with the only one-eyed one, and used his perennial scouting skills to check the skills. Unless the deceitful means of these dwarves have reached the peak of their culmination, they can hide their lies under such sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
