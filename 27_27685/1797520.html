Things. According to him, the Federation retrieved some of the books, but the spell reel had only one "star projection". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astral is a transitional plane separating the main material plane and the outer plane. This popular saying that is passed between the casters is not very accurate, but it is not much different from the fact. With some spells, any creature can project its own consciousness to the stars, and the upper and lower sides of the tour are all silvery, with occasional strange worlds flying over the island. The astral can transform all thinking into matter and automatically create the body for the consciousness of entering the world. There is an invisible silver clue between the ontology and the astral consciousness. If the conscious body is hurt, it can also return to the body along the silver line in an instant, thus avoiding dangers such as death. Except for some specific weapons and spells, there are very few things that can damage the silver line, but if the silver line is cut off, then consciousness can no longer return, and this state and death are not much different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astral projection is a spell that allows the wizard's consciousness to enter the astral, and can continue to strengthen the stability of the silver line according to the improvement of the wizard's spellcasting skills. In the astral world, it is very convenient to use a meditation method to test a spell, because thinking can automatically become a real thing, so the whole world is like a "higher creation" of infinite energy. As long as the mage's own consciousness can be carried, it is ok to create a magical spacecraft in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another use of the astral projections is widely spread in the multi-dimensional plane, which is almost the most powerful adventure spell of the Master. After using the astral projection to generate the conscious entity, the astral projection is again used to create a second conscious projection in the other world. It is like a relay, relying on the astral as a transition, going back and returning, forming your own body of consciousness to explore those dangerous places. As long as the destination and the two places of the star are guaranteed, the silver line between the projection of consciousness and the body is not threatened, and even if the projection of consciousness is dead, it will not hurt the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical scroll of the astral projection was handed over to William. He is responsible for making it into a magical spell book so that the other wizards of the union have the opportunity to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just in captivity to death?" Shelley looked at the Siegel Master's proposal on how to deal with Edith's proposal, showing an incredible expression: " Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Idis has lived for a few days." Siegel said: "The bottle of medicine found in his room." Indeed, as he said, it is a kind of life remedy. It can prolong the life of a person. Itis relies on this kind of thing to escape the natural death of the end of life. He is now very debilitated, he may breathe at any time, at most I will live for more than two months. I oppose all the punishments of killing. It is a kind of relief to kill him directly. It is better to let him experience the death threat for a while. The federation needs to do it. Just to ensure that his soul is not reborn or resurrected. It may be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand, the pain of ** has no meaning for Edith, but there is also the possibility of the soul. Necromancer Shelley nodded and no longer objected to this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Pharmacy exudes a strong spell of magical light, so stayed here at Siegel. He will take the time to research and analyze this strange magical agent, hoping to reverse the manufacturing method. At present, there seems to be no ability to cast spells at the sergeant level. It is impossible to do this. William is not very strong outside the changing system, so he can only rely on Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Federation also found two other mages who provided the Master Association with nuclear information. The punishment for them is a behead. The first level of the two will be dealt with by the Necromancer, permanently inserted on the spear, and placed on the head of the magic spaceship to warn the descendants. The Security Council, which is composed of the heads of the factions, has no objection to this decision and will be implemented in a matter of days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another thing is tricky, it’s about the secret primaries of the Masters Association. A source of magical energy like the Mire Nuclear, as soon as you start working, produces a very unique elemental signal that can't be obscured anyway. In addition to managing the nuclear and energy-focusing lens arrays of the city of Syracuse, Siegel’s No. 1 lamp god is constantly detecting this special element signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Locating according to the elemental signal. The Masters Association has created two secret energy cores, which are stored in the magic tower of the Old World Blue Ice Tower and the Splendid Marsh. Siegel reported the result to the board and then said: "First of all, I have to explain to the board that the secret nuclear design of the syndicate is completely ok. But without my elemental aggregate. The model, the Miereng nuclear will eventually have devastating consequences. The secret space of the magic spacecraft is safe, and you can use it with confidence. But any newly manufactured Mire nuclear still needs to pass my hand, otherwise the problem will be sooner or later. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that future generations can always surpass their predecessors, and a stable elemental polymer model will not be such a kind. The final decision is nothing more than the cost of experimentation, that is, resources, time and life." Gerr understands Wendy's emotions. After all, Wendy is the most excited one when he announces the provision of the secret energy to the Federation. In a sense, Siegel once again "deceived" her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the sentence is not good, I have already expected that the drawings of the secret nuclear core may leak out, but I did not expect it to be so fast, so thorough. Siegel looked at the other members of the board: "The Masters Association has completed two secret weapons, and only one situation allows them to have such efficiency, that is, they have obtained the original drawings without encryption. I think Do you use a certain ciphertext in your own spellbooks? Why is this 42-drawing drawing so fast that the Masters Association is all obtained? It is one thing to have a traitor, irresponsible and numb is the most terrible "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three factions of protection, curse and change are the most responsible, because more than 80% of the magic spacecraft's workload is in these three factions, they are simultaneously Also responsible for protecting these drawings. Siegel's gaze swept through them, and these wizards could not help but bow their heads. However, Siegel’s tone changed: “The current issue is not to determine internal responsibilities, but to discuss how to deal with the two secret nucleus of the Masters Association.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them blow up!" Master Sementon of the plastics department yelled: "Fighting these thieves! If it is not too dangerous, I want to visit the scene and watch them be burnt to death by the elements!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, let them blow!" The Security Council took only a few seconds to form a consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, which is the same as his own thoughts. "Through the energy fluctuations of the elements. I can roughly infer the approximate time of their explosion. What I am going to say is another thing: I hope to be able to mobilize the magic spacecraft to perform a mission to recover the Master's Core." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone stunned, and Verwood said: "What does it mean to recycle nuclear? Is it possible that the secret nuclear will not be destroyed together in the explosion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The core will inevitably melt down, but about 90% of the remaining parts can continue to be used." Siegel said: "The construction can be verified according to the drawings." More than ten tons of weight. In addition to the magic spaceship, other methods are not shipped back. The cost of each nuclear can be equivalent to 500,000 gold coins, some resources are still priceless, and can not be missed if you can recycle. Now We already have the advantage: the maneuverability and concealment of the spacecraft are very good. I already know the position of the two nuclear weapons. It is absolutely safe to hide in a hundred miles. So in the event of an explosion, the rest is flying over. Take it away, it’s so simple "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a problem," said Master Shelley: "When did they explode? If not, do you still wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will solve this problem and will not waste everyone too much time." Siegel apparently had a draft, but there was no more explanation at the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the agreement, if only one secret energy core can be recovered, Siegel will get this energy core to continue research and development. The federation should use its own actual actions to make up for the mistakes of leaking. If the action is fast enough to take back two, then Siegel promises to fix it, so that the union will have one more nuclear. The magical spaceship order of the Starry Kingdom is now placed at the headquarters of the Federation, along with the seal of His Majesty the King. This is a matter of great importance both economically and politically. The Security Council has already reached a consensus that it will use the power of the starry kingdom to rapidly expand itself, while weakening the school and affecting the development of the Masters Association. One more secret can save a lot of time, and each faction leader is not a fool. Naturally, this account can be clearly counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret nuclear value is high, but will this be the only gain from this action? Although no one puts this matter on the face, everyone knows it. The tidal elements caused by the nucleus of the nucleus will only affect the magical items and the caster, and will not commit any other things in the fall. So what exactly is something else? All metal, ore, gemstones, and alchemy materials will be in good condition. Books without a protective spell will not be affected. The best thing is that the enchantments that originally protected these things are all gone, and the protectors will not be left! In fact, this is to enter a room that is not locked, and then empty the things inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Masters Association catches up, everyone is not very worried. The magic spaceship is the magic tower of the movement. If the federation can't resist other casters with the help of the Master Tower, it will simply surrender. the fact is. Under the energy supply of the Urin nuclear, the Masters Association can destroy the magic ship unless it makes up its mind and sacrifices the lives of seven or eight sergeants. After deliberation, the people of the Security Council felt that this possibility was very low and the risk of action was affordable. Therefore, the proposal for action was adopted and only specific plans were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
