			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red dot goblin...oh no, it’s already red rounded. They have already failed in the sniper battle, almost consuming all the mobile forces. Although there are still a large number of individual weapons, but for the magical spacecraft at high altitude, the real damage can not be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they still didn’t stop, a small wave of waves came up to death. This is the most troublesome place for the goblin. The so-called true endlessness is reflected in the red round goblin. Stars did not care, she slowly recovered the damaged body while slowly playing the rushing goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, there is a strange phenomenon." She suddenly said: "I found that some missiles did not explode after being smashed, but directly dismembered, then dropped Go to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is not through the study of the goblin researchers, Siegel will be confused. Only one kind of goblin weapon will have such an effect, that is, a nuclear bomb. The star-shaped electromagnetic gun has a huge impact. Even if it hits the core of the atomic bomb, it is often crushed rather than pressed inward. Therefore, only a very small possibility will detonate the nuclear bomb. At other times, it will be like a star, but it will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin has used nuclear weapons, and it seems that the battle is going to the next stage. Siegel lifted the force field to fix himself, and stood up and said: "Continue to follow the original plan, raise the empty gun and give control to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Master, I will do it right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all electromagnetic guns can withstand the effects of time and space shocks, can be played The spatial collapse effect and the spatial penetration effect are two different things. The former only needs to use the cyclic transmission array and then adhere to the limit of transmission, which naturally triggers the space collapse. However, only by relying on the strength of the sergeant to change the time flow rate and the spatial nature, the electromagnetic gun can become a physical obstacle. Void gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the goblin's nuclear bomb destroyed the spacecraft, a few empty guns were fired so that the force could be fully displayed. There is only one vanity gun on the entire spacecraft, which is independent of the 36 ordinary electromagnetic guns and is not used at all. It is three times the size of a regular cannon. Specially powered by the small secret energy core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel conducted a number of virtual-aircraft launch tests in the astral world, roughly figuring out how to control the damage position. After all, the projectile has no entity after flying out, or it is no longer in the original space (dimension). When it's declining energy, it's like sending a super-powerful bomb to its destination. Then directly detonate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astral tests can only be used as a reference, and formal trials have only been conducted once. After all, the launch of the Nether Artillery requires the sorcerer to oscillate time and space. This is quite physical, and Siegel can't bear it several times. So he cherished this experimental opportunity and decided to leave it to the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star number flies slowly for a while. After the maintenance work is over, it starts to accelerate. At the time of the Goblin Seaport, Xingsuo blew all the ships, factories and warehouses into pieces, and under the direction of Siegel, it had been descending heights, less than one hundred meters from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving goblins did not evade, they picked up any weapons that could still work and fired at the spacecraft, but these moves were meaningless. The magical missiles that are bound to hit are very effective at this distance, and light armor targets are hard to pose a threat unless they are large enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for landing is for the metal materials here. The entire star number is composed of astral projections, and in the astral experiment, the warheads made by the astral material often collapse. Siegel estimates that because it can not withstand the huge space-time effect, it is better to launch real substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-gravity array is diffused. Under the action of the airflow, the inventory in the dock is sucked into the cabin of the Xingsuo, and Siegel also takes it A communication phone. At the same time that the mobile phone number was displayed in the direction of space with illusion, Xingsuo picked out the strongest magnetic material among all the spoils and sent it to the Void Gun. The others were thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goblin giants are sure to see the phone number, but the phone has never been ringing. The star number rose again and the signal disappeared. At this time, even if you want to play, you can't get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter, the hope is rather embarrassing, there is no need to lose it. Using the power of the elements and the mind, Siegel creates a suitable projectile from the alloy. Place it on the track of the void gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavier the shell, the more powerful it is, but the closer the attack distance is. In order to deter the goblin, nature is as powerful as possible. This time the launch was slightly biased. Directly into the center of a goblin city - Siegel originally wanted to destroy the factory group not far from him, and did not expect to hit the residential area. In an instant, all the light of the city disappeared, and the darkness swallowed everything. The area with a radius of five kilometers was directly erased, and it became a history that would never appear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravity collapses to the center, and the land ten kilometers outward from the center of the explosion is all sucked up to form a shape that curls toward the center. All colors are reddish and then dim. At this time, some lucky people can cry for help, but they do not know that their fate is doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a large amount of material pouring into the center, gravity is difficult to maintain, and it collapses outward. The substances that have reached the core area will naturally disappear forever, but the substances that have not disappeared during the annihilation process will be released, with great energy. For a time, the brightness and temperature of the attacked area exceeded the sun, and the light could be seen through a quarter of the planet. Then the hot storm swept the earth, within a hundred kilometers of the sea of ​​fire, and even thousands of kilometers away there is heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather system of the planet was destroyed, and a large number of small storms came into being, which would merge with each other within a few days to form a super typhoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel releases his hand and tries to calm his breath. This time, the casting method is much better than in the past. The shape of the elemental polymer has a stronger control and bearing capacity, and the damage of the time flow rate is much smaller. The damage on ** can be circumvented this way, but mental fatigue is inevitable. Siegel sat down to meditation and regained his concentration in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the void guns are also subject to maintenance. Any flaws can have devastating consequences, so the stars are not sloppy. At the same time, she also shoulders the task of collecting battlefield data, and uses the advantage of flying high to see the situation of the weapon attack for a period of time to describe Siegel in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes did not understand what happened, after all, this attack has almost no warning. Some goblin researchers have captured the weird changes in the electromagnetic field near the star, but they have not been able to link this change to the attack. The giants knew that they had been attacked after seeing the glare of half of the earth. Of course, they are very aware of what the subsequent flame storm is all about, but what happened before needs to be found in the video. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the goblins deployed a large number of spy satellites in space. Almost every city is under surveillance. So several images of different definitions are quickly sent to the screen in front of the goblin giant. This is a way of attack that I have never seen before, but I have to say that the effect is amazing. The goblins watched the video over and over again, and they had a rare worship and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts brought by second-class gnome researchers are even more alarming. According to their calculations, the connection between the explosion center and the Zenith Starship was cut on the planet's ground. No one saw an arc attack. Goblins have long known that when they reach a certain speed, they will be free from the gravitational pull of the planet, so if the magical projectile that caused the explosion is in an arc, the speed should be too fast. Because the Zenith Starship has demonstrated stealth capabilities, the initial inference of the Goblin is an undetectable stealth projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without radar warning, nothing has been found?" Silent Goblin spoke up. This thing has become tricky. All goblins are developing means to defend against nuclear bombs. The most basic of these is to detect attacks as early as possible, and it is possible to intercept them. Everyone knows this. Now there is a means that cannot be detected and it cannot be protected. Therefore, there is only one thought left in the goblin: "Solve him as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the silent goblin, but other goblins also form a consensus in the tacit understanding, this time must use nuclear weapons And, if it is the most advanced nuclear weapon. There is no need to hide it, because I don’t know who will fall on the head of the next blow. From the underground tunnel, from the cruise plane, from the water, from the ground, thousands of nuclear warheads flew to the star. They left a strong trail on the sky of the planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile warheads, split warheads, space orbital warheads, and ultra-high-speed anti-ballistic warheads have surpassed the limits of the ability of star-solder electromagnetic guns. Siegel has walked back to the control room, hand on the core crystal, comforting some panicked stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a real war, I have already left you with a teleportation. They can’t catch us." Siegel said: Your ability to go to the very high air, such as the vacuum area, is higher than the goblin satellite, then no nuclear bomb can hurt you. Your mobility is beyond the reach of the goblin. But for my plan, Still have to stay here and let the nuclear bomb hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
