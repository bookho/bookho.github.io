			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three assassins have been caught up by Siegel and burnt to ashes in the flames. The wizard unfolds the black flame wings that are ignited by anger and rushes to the assassin who escapes with incredible maneuverability. In a blink of an eye, he caught the target. The pure element of fire was shot from his palm. The flesh and blood could not withstand the hot heat, and there was only black smoke and wreckage between the breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black saint appears silently behind his back, holding an obsidian dagger in his hand. Siegel perceives that the distribution of elements after the birth has changed, and it seems that something hinders the flow of gas. He saw the assassin wrapped in a black robe with the corner of his eye and saw the familiar black dagger. However, he did not feel the killing, and the scorpion's early warning ability did not prompt the next five seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who it is, there is only a running dog of the murder god in this cave, no friends. He knew that he had no time to turn around, so he twitched his arm and flipped the long sword back. The long sword touches the dagger more than the dagger, and can hit the enemy earlier, and it will solve the problem. But the black saints simply ignored the long sword that pierced his heart, and the arm did not shake at all, clinging the dagger into the right shoulder of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least six layers of magical defense spells flash in sequence, including any doors that should be able to send Siegel out. But the black saints used their power to suppress the role of the spell, and even used some of the divine power. The light flashed and the dagger did not reach the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flock: Elemental spelling." The black saints read a sentence, and then the obsidian daggers let out the light, shrouded Siegel. The connection between the element and the mage was completely cut off, and he was trapped in the anti-magic force field. The wings formed by the flames and the burning swords are all extinguished. The true knowledge and dark vision in the eyes can't see the surrounding environment, and it becomes unclear again. Siegel has only the most basic swordsmanship and bodywork to be able to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concentrated on his thoughts and tried to communicate the transmission of the Elven Saint to bring himself out of this dilemma. But the elements did not respond and the delivery was isolated. He was about to mobilize the energy on the plasmonic bones to cast the spell, and he was hit by the black man's head and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't pull out the dagger, or you can't hold him." The black saint slowly pulled out the long sword inserted in the heart. The sword actually brought a few traces of blood, which made Dorn and others fearful. Quickly kneel down and ask for sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your strength is not good, you need to continue to improve, in order to continue to serve the gods." The black saint said: "Unfortunately there are no soldiers like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there will be soon." Dorn reveals a strange smile: "With him as a template, I will be able to create a more powerful rubber warrior." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, the power of my Lord will not be wasted." The black saint said: "Lock his hands and feet with shackles." All the things on the body are taken down, you must not be taken lightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Reese come over and see what this guy is. He can actually hurt me with ordinary weapons." The black saint said: "I am afraid his blood is a bit weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." There was a rare fear in Donne’s eyes. But still nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s bones are much harder than ordinary people, and the way the shocking skull makes people stun is less affected by him, so the assassins search for items and for him. He woke up when he took the ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain caused by the dagger on the back is unbearable, but what is even more annoying is that it has been suppressing elemental energy. The anti-magic force field is an annoying effect that the Master thinks is a cowardly curse that escapes reality. Despite the ethical defamation of this spell, it is undeniable that this spell has a very powerful effect in actual combat. Especially the priests who do not like the magic of the gods, often cover themselves against the magic field, and then copy the mace to try to close the war with the wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Master has the combat experience of facing the Golem, and the anti-Magic Warrior is actually very similar. However, the situation at hand is the addition of the handcuffs and ankles, and the whole body is **. There aren't even weapons, let alone two black assassins and four colloidal warriors at the moment. Dorn is also at the forefront, chanting praises for the murder god from time to time. You must first find a way to pull out the dagger in the back, in order to consider the next move, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they came to a underground rift. An arched stone bridge spans a distance of twenty meters, just above the rift. Perhaps there used to be a raging underground river in the past. Perhaps it is a dark hole formed by the tides of the sea, but there is no water here. Only a myriad of creeping clay monsters gather in the rift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have different colors and shapes that fill the entire rift. Siegel narrowed his eyes and tried to carefully distinguish the type of glue. It is reasonable to say that the sand and mud are stucco. The translucent green acid is a clay monster. The dark yellow should be a rougher than the dark one. The pure black should be more like a round paste. It is a black pudding monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the rift. A lot of colors are mixed together, like a palette of crazy painters stirring around. The mud monsters merged and digested each other at a slow speed, and the screaming sound continued to sound, and the tone seemed like a boiling kettle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a source of coldness. The mountain walls on both sides of the rift are dripping into ice. The moist air passes through here and it will snow and frost, covering the gelatin monster. Thick one layer. Although the cold does not bring extra damage to the gelatin monster, this gel-like monster never likes the low temperature environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you throw him away from here?" An assassin said: "Let him slowly digest in the gummy belly, isn't it? A rare beauty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then you are responsible for picking up the dagger from below, then going to the madman Rees to do the template." With a cold voice, the pastor's words Let the assassin close his mouth and bow his head behind the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not expect to see Dr. Reese in this place, he thought that this person died in the walled mountains. If the blood magician is the chief culprit in the awakening of Janet's blood, then Rees is also one of the promoters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looks like the past, but his gray hair is obviously much less, and his body is no longer bent over. After standing straight, Reese had a look of one meter, which was very cramped in the cave. He has a lab, it's messy, and there are all kinds of bottles and test materials everywhere. There are three bodies lying on each of the three planer beds. Although they are stinking, somehow still have blood dripping from the bed. Siegel had the privilege of not sharing the bunk with the three bed guests, but was hung on an iron shelf, and the chain opened his limbs to make him unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese’s small eyes sparkled with excitement and looked at Siegel with the eyes of the judge. "Strong guinea pigs, what do you want to do this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find out what kind of variety he is, and then use it as a template." Rubbing his lips, respectfully said: "The saints are embarrassed, don't pull the dagger behind him, lest you can't suppress him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, actually I used one of the four killing swords. It seems that your group of idiots is too bad, let the saints personally take it out? What power is this blockade?" He walked behind Siegel and stared at the dagger. Hold the handle, and then ask yourself: "Oh, the ability to cast spells. Is this a swordsman or a mage, why should you seal this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is It is one of the problems of the saints." After Dorn finished speaking, he was ready to retire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be busy, Dorn, this is the potion for your wife." Rees took a bottle of black medicine from the shelf and placed it on Dorn. Hands. "Although I have said it many times, I can't help but think back to your wife's cry at the time. It's really nostalgic. When did you bring Lily? I have been mentioning it for a long time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon." Dorn put the pill bottle up, and kept saying: "Soon, very soon..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, remember it." Reese waved his hand and let them leave like a group of flies. When there was only him and Siegel left in the room, Reese suddenly turned his head and smiled and said: "If you have already woken up, don't sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked up and the chain creaked as the body moved. He tried to swear first, and he couldn’t break freely because of strength, and he didn’t want to break free now. "I haven't seen you for a long time, Dr. Rees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you have seen me, why don't I have an impression?" He screamed excitedly as if he had a fun. Things: "Don't tell me, let me guess who you are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
