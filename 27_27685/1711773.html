			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people outside Kerry’s tent, they are very concerned about the birth of the child. Kerry’s brother left only two daughters in his lifetime. If Kerry’s son can be born smoothly, then with the son, Kerry will definitely be the next chief of the Jackdaw tribe. There are strangers everywhere, they are noisy and noisy. Until the tribe's wizard arrived, summoned a large group of flying mosquitoes to rush them, and it was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are flashing, they are all flashing away, I want to see a child looking for my own mother!" The wizard, the dragon, is old, bent over, but still speaks with full confidence. The sound is loud. He came with his own apprentices and was the only one who could enter and exit the tent, except for Maisala's maid. A fire pit was dug outside the tent, and the water was burned in a large pot. A rough roof made of animal skin was supported by a wooden shelf to prevent sudden wind and rain on the grassland. There was also an uncovered fire at the downwind, and several people were flipping a large barbeque on the fire, and the scent made Siegel drool. With Janet's help, he walked over and then a large piece of hind legs was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brave man who doesn’t know, says, "Come, warrior, eat first!" Then there were two big jars handed over, one filled with light Beer, the other is goat milk. Siegel sat by the fire for a while, and was already full of food in front: bread, cheese, milk tofu, and grilled mushrooms and river fish. Siegel won the good feelings of the people here with his heroic battle, and let them appreciate the wonderful battles, so the people here took the delicious food and let him feel the enthusiasm of the Jackdaw tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel glared at Janet's happy big chews and then pulled Krila over. The giant is now much more nervous than fighting, and even affects the strength of his eating. He took a clean, clean hind leg and still used it to grind his teeth. Even the dog who was screaming everywhere gave up waiting for the bone, and Wang Wang cried and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production lasted for a long time, and the screams of Mesera continued to be heard in the tent. The maids went in and out of the busy, constantly changing towels and basins. The mother had a difficult birth, and the group was very nervous. Kerry was restless. He was a big man who was tortured by his mother when he was born, his body became very weak, and he died of a minor illness two years later. The giant has been afraid that his child is also a big man, will not take away the life of the black wolf princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds from the tents have always been strong and powerful, and the wizards have used the blessings to bless the production process. "I took your big man and it was a hard fight. Your son is not as exaggerated as you are, and your wife is much tougher than you think. This is her first production, so it is more difficult, Don't worry." The middle wizard came out and said a few words to everyone, and then went back to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the afternoon until midnight, you can toss everyone. Siegel's jar of sugar helped a lot, adding a lot of energy to the maternal irrigation. Today is the full moon night, the stars in the sky are hidden under the bright moonlight, so the silver glow is full of the earth. From the east, there was a cool wind blowing, and the flame inside the fire pit was swaying. Janet had covered the blanket and fell asleep beside the fire. Kerry and Siegel sat next to each other, waiting very anxiously - Mesella began to shout again, and the wizard shouted "Come on, force! It will be born soon!" - This is already The fifth time this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so hard." Kerry’s face has been whitened many times. This is definitely a test for him: “I hope that the Spirit of Nature blesses, The spirit of the ancestors protects you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't know how to comfort him, he is thinking about something else. The birth of a life is so difficult, both the child and the mother suffer from pain, so why is the mother abandoning her own child? He had never been willing to ponder this question before, but this situation evoked doubts in his heart. Captain Ma Lin made it very clear that when Siegel was discovered, it was three or five days in size, and there were no female passengers in the journey, especially pregnant female passengers. So Siegel can only be a child of God, without a mother. Siegel has never believed this, but he can't refute the words of the old captain—sometimes he even wishfully wished he was the illegitimate son of the old captain, and was given a story to bring to the boat to raise. But his weird looks are not similar to the captain, and this last hope is shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘If I have a mother, I hope that my birth did not cause so much pain for her – this may be the only thing I can do for her. ‘Siegel thought in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight flashed a bit, and Siegel looked up curiously and found nothing. Some clouds floated from the east and began to slowly cover the light of the moon. ‘Maybe it’s a small cloud. Siegel thought he was wrong. But at this time, a short flash of light suddenly appeared in the black night sky, in the shadow formed by the high mountains on the northern horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A darkness, nothing." The giant narrowed his eyes, looked closely, and said, "Are you too sleepy, go to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, there must be something." The feeling in Siegel's heart is getting stronger and stronger. It is a feeling of embarrassment, unable to grasp the evil atmosphere of the unknown. He frowned and felt that his feelings were wrong. Until he suddenly found an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you not see the outline of the mountains in the distance? How did it become dark? Where did the shadow go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a glare of light flashed, and the grass in the distance ignited a fire, and the shadow of the slender fire line leaped. Then came the horn sound, rushing and nervous, that is the horn of the warning. The sound only came to a halt for a while, but it was enough for the people in the camp to hear it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was an accident! It was the Black Sheep tribe!" Kerry hurriedly called the soldiers and asked him to inform the leaders. "We have to hurry to help them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of self-help first." Siegel’s eyes have insight into the change: the flames in the distance are thrown in blazing, But above the sky, there is a small flame that is flying directly to where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp blew the horn, three sounds, this is the highest warning message, indicating that a raid has taken place and all soldiers need to be prepared to fight to death. However, there are too many tribes gathered here, and the horn signals between them are different, which quickly caused confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alert! Alert! Prepare the horses!" Kerry directed his right-wing "Giant Group" and continued to give instructions: "Bring women and children Go to the hole! Let all the men get ready! If you don't have weapons, go to the well and get some water! Hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but leave them action Time is too little, and the fire quickly approached the Jackdaw tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of huge red wings rushed out of the shadows, obscuring the moonlight and covering half the sky. There is a long tail behind it, and an elegant arc in the air. The curved long neck is a huge head, and the golden eyes sparkle with a sultry light. The flame rolled in its mouth and slammed out of the sharp tooth gap. His nose was smoky, his claws were dripping with blood, and the solid, tight scales shone in the fire. Siegel is very sure that it is a red dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a strong sense of fear that shrouds the entire tribe as it is, and the ground is silent, as if the wind and fire are solidified. Then the huge screams were deafening, the fiery flames were overwhelming, everyone cried, screamed, and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon swept through the camp, leaving a burning ditch, and divided the camp into two halves like a cake, which made him very satisfied. Although it has dark vision, it cannot be seen too far in the dark, it also needs enough flame to make a light source. And letting humans mourn, struggle, and then painful death in the sea of ​​fire is its favorite drama - it has not been seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of pain coming from a scale behind it, and then a clear voice appeared in its mind: "Hurry up and fly back, with flames Circle the camp and don't let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nasty death knight! The red dragon immediately turned in the direction, turned to fly back, lowered the height, bent down the neck, allowing the flame to continue to spit for a longer time, circle around the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the soldiers of the Jackdaw tribe have reacted and attacked the monster. A burst of arrows rained toward the red dragon, most of them were lost, and the rest were broken by the dragon's scales, and they all fell back to the ground. The arrows of the flying dragon wings were rolled up by the air, and many of them flew back. Many people who fled on the ground were hit by these arrows and fell to the ground and mourned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in the dragon's mouth has not stopped, he turned a large circle around the camp, and then hovered in the air. Some people living on the edge were lucky enough to escape the fire circle, and they rushed wildly on the grasslands, trying to stay away from it. The red dragon swayed its wings and chased it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince! The flames are not extinguished, and there is no use for pouring water!" A soldier ran with his face, his arms and chest were smoked. blacken. "The smoke from the fire is poisonous, and many people have been comatose!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
