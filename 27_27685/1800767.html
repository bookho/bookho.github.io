			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo had a good time at the landing site, but Siegel was still interrogated like a prisoner. The goblin giants were reluctant to come up with a list of techniques, and they were convinced that they couldnâ€™t ask any high-tech knowledge from the embarrassment, so they showed their face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the room slowly opened, a goblin with a pale red skin came in, holding a pair of cockroaches in his hand. "The giants want to see you, but for safety reasons, you need to bring a restraint device."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the display for communication is in the room, if If you want to see it, you can remove the fuzzification effect and you can make a clear video conversation. Siegel knew that cockroaches were the pretexts of the goblins, and they seemed to start with themselves. Everything was expected, so he reached out and let the goblin carry the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece is made of fine gold and comes with an electric shock device. Maybe Goblin thinks this will work for the Zenith Star. Then Siegel was taken to another room, and as soon as the door opened, several robotic arms caught him at a speed that was too fast, and then bound him to a clean and flat table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold ring that was prepared long ago was buckled on the bones and all major joints were inactive. At the same time, the ceiling of the room hangs down several high-speed machine guns, always aiming at Siegel's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This room is dedicated to the study of monsters, especially those powerful creatures that have been mutated by the influence of different dust." Entering seven or eight from the small door on one side Goblin researchers, they use carts to bring piles of tools: "The Zenith Star, countless monsters that are stronger than you can't escape from here. You don't have to work hard. From now on, we will discuss cooperation in the way of goblin. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, in what way does the goblin cooperate?" Siegel can still mobilize the power of the element, so he begins to seduce charm and hints The spells fluctuate, slowly affecting the thoughts of the surrounding goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is what I ask, what do you answer." The goblin researcher said: "How do you get into your spaceship?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the position where I am out of the cabin, then say please open the door." Siegel lay flat, the tone is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So simple? It seems that you are dishonest, but it doesn't matter. We will soon know the answer." The goblin closed the entire room and picked it up. The high-frequency vibrating cutter smiled sullenly: "I didn't expect to study so many creatures, but I can still see a living state like this. It's so perfect. It's so exciting!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think so?" Siegel seems to have no bondage consciousness, still talking to the Gnome researcher: "This is all for the needs of the universe. No need to eat, drink and Breathing, there is no disease or poisoning, and there is no life limit. The only trouble is that it will be locked in a big bed and threatened by weak creatures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our body is not as good as you. But we have a powerful tool." The goblin began to recharge the vibrating knife and proudly introduced to Siegel: "According to my observation, your body is not as strong, so I will get the slice soon. I want to find it from you. The secret of being immortal, even the youthful pharmacy will be eclipsed under my discovery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, do you understand the secret of youth pharmacy?" In a admirable tone, Geer said: "You should be the highest scientific secret of the earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researcher with confidential training knows how to keep his mouth shut. The power of charm spells offsets the training they experience. It seems that it is not how to talk to outsiders for a long time, and the researcher's goblin has begun to talk about his great achievements. Soon this sentiment spread, from a goblin speech to a group of goblin group chat. From time to time, Siegel inserted a few words and finally figured out the identity of this group of goblins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their unique embarrassing form. So Goblin sent senior researchers in biology, medicine, materials science, and electronics to try to discover the secrets of the Zenith star. This group of goblins has fallen far behind the expected progress because of chat. Finally, the red skin goblin asks inward through the loudspeaker: "What are you doing, why is a report not yet submitted?!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblins responded, and quickly took the vibrating knife that had already been refilled and walked over to prepare to cut Siegel's leg bones. "If you hurt me, then you will lose another chance." Siegel once again warned the goblin. But as he expected, the goblin would not listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrating knife failed to fall on Siegel's leg, but it was cut directly onto the experimental bench. The original gold ring that had been tied up was also dropped. Siegel gasified himself and then reorganized his body in the corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-speed machine guns turn immediately. Aim and fire. Siegel exerted his mind and used his hand to squeeze the two fire points. Although the barrel of the machine gun is very strong, not all components can achieve the same level. The central convergence of the four sides and eight directions severely broke some parts. The bullets were bombarded everywhere, and then both weapons fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small holes hidden in the room violently ejected gas, which is definitely a procedure for fixing the routine. Siegel does not need to breathe at all, and these gases are not corrosive. What effect can he have? But the goblin researchers in the room are really valuable trophies, and Siegel can't make them suffer too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is a gas, always follow the flow of wind. The cyclone caused by the gas element forces the poison gas that is ejected into the corner, and then the water element absorbs them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to break your own self?" When the girl asked the goblin with a low voice, the fear of racial nature was finally triggered. The goblins cried and surrendered, one by one on the ground, and the whole body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to resolve the monitoring facility to be insured. Siegel thought of this, so he released a powerful electric field and burned all the lines buried in the wall. The current from the fingertips along these lines constantly destroys the equipment along the way, and soon the entire base is in a state of stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is still not at ease, he does not use spellcasting gestures, does not recite spells, and only controls his spells with his own will. At this time, the elemental polymer pattern on his body plays an important role. It is like a magical map that can change according to consciousness, and assists the Siegel combination spell structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need all of your research, especially the youth pharmacy." Siegel said to them: "We only have ten minutes to complete this thing, So everyone should concentrate and don't think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Knox's spells and colloidal template warrior's skills to inscribe spells, Siegel from the minds of researchers Pick up key information. Although the terminology of many studies cannot be immediately understood, some formulas and drawings are too late to be seen, but it is already a great improvement to be able to record what these goblins have been hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he cast a rusted claw spell and dug through the metal door and came to the passage. There was only dim light in the hallway, and the gnome gunner who had been ambushed immediately fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a tracer of bullets, Siegelâ€™s defensive array flew over, and Mars was fired on the wall, and flashing grenade and blasting grenade threw him at him. Come. For this kind of closed space battle, Siegel had a draft. He pushed his hands outward and pushed all the elements of the air into a gust of wind, blowing all the throwing weapons away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the air in the entire passage was drained by Siegel, the explosion caused by the grenade was much smaller than expected. The goblin gunners tumbling on the ground, they quickly lost the ability to escape, toward the inevitable death. Even the gunman with a gas mask has only insisted for more than a dozen seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunmen on the ground stopped convulsions, and Siegel allowed the elements to return to normal flow. Although it is not too difficult to kill the ground directly from here, why bother to waste that strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the goblin researchers behind him, and they died because of suffocation. Siegel knew that the construction of the goblin had fire-fighting measures. Burning the body was useless, so the scene was cleaned with an acid rain to prevent the enemy from seeing what was on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he casts invisibility and uses it to send it to the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes have also been trying to open the door to the Stars, but the magical spacecraft with all sorts of tricks has made the attempts of the goblins all fall through. It is estimated that there has been news of a conflict in the garrison of the Zenith Star, and the researchers of the Goblin began to withdraw, and the army's chariots began to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes can't see Siegel at all, but the star is very clear about the return of the master. He opened the hatch and extended the ladder to the ground. She used the communication technique to send a warm welcome: "Master, you are finally back, I miss you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
