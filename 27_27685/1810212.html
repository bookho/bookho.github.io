			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the return of the goblin wall, Siegel spent more time in the lab. He uses the oscillating time method to change his time flow rate and gets two hours of extra learning progress per day. This time, I read the high magic scrolls and forced my body to undergo time-lapse baptism again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Gerald’s mage friend, Siegel got a few notes from the legendary Master. Through these transcripts, he knows that when using legendary spells, the power of some rules will enter the caster's body, permanently changing them. Many people think that this is a process of deifying the body, making it easier to accept the power of the rule and become closer to the Holy One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a godhead, it will be more or less affected by the crystal wall. Because the crystal wall itself is the carrier of the rule, the godhead is also. When the god wants to use the force of the rule, it will touch the crystal wall, and the part that does not conform to the "idea" of the crystal wall will be weakened. Only those gods who are detached from the crystal wall and have the ability to create crystal walls will use their power without restriction. This kind of god is called the creation god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of the creation god is too high, and the general gods are trying to reach that level. In some world myths and legends, the god of dwarfs creates the whole world. However, the dwarven race god is not a creation god. He has the power of forging, but he can only transform it with ready-made materials. He cannot create from nothing like a real creation god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how to become a god of creation is the secret that all gods want. They will spread their footprints in various walls and worlds, hoping that one day they will be able to unravel the mystery. , sublimate your own strength. However, before becoming a god of creation, if you want to use divine power in the crystal wall, the body of the saint is the limit allowed by the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage believes that getting your body more accustomed to changing the state of the rules will get closer and closer to the Holy One. In the history, many legendary mages have tried and achieved certain results, but they have not really reached expectations. Siegel quickly understood why: although he was very careful. But the power of changing the time rule still affects his **. Some skin ages, dehydrates more than normal speed, and the skin wrinkles and becomes slack like the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the skin will return to normal only after soaking in the water for a good night's rest. Siegel has experimented with himself many times. It is found that as the time of own oscillation increases, the area of ​​aging is also larger, and the recovery will be slower. The flesh and blood body is very fragile in this process, but if it oscillates time and space in the form of sputum, it will not be affected by this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not completely unaffected. Siegel found some tiny patterns on his skeleton. It is superimposed with the elemental polymer lines, but it does not affect the two. The texture of the polymer comes from the plasma grain. It is carved out on the Nevsky spacecraft with a plasma weapon. It feels bumpy. However, the texture formed by time turbulence can only be seen, but it can't be touched, and it will not be affected by any element. It only shines when it is compressed, and it extends slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what the effect of this pattern is, but it doesn’t seem to matter at the moment. There is no explanation for this change in the records. I have never known whether I am doing the right thing or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel has clones. Death is nothing but a de novo...not to start all over again, just to get back to the age of twenty-four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made three of his own clones, one in the city of Mystery, one on the star, and one on the world of the goblin, avoiding the dust Radiation in the underground deep pit. Take a part of your body and soak it in a special formula for cloning. How to give Siegel a feeling of growing food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the gods feel the same when making the saints? Pinch a part of your own power and merge it with the rules of the crystal wall. Only the divine power and the rule of the crystal wall can make the saints. It is impossible to recreate the "mortal" spells with cloning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the meat that stopped squirming. The attempt to know the cloning of the Holy Land was a complete failure. But why did Lear's clones fail in the same way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee does not have the power of the saints in all respects, but why does the body have the characteristics of the saints? Siegel had seen Lear's legendary spells, and he had seen the Elven Saints use spells; when Lear was taken off his fingers. The body also did not reveal the breath of the sacred sacred sacred Chanm or the mother of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
