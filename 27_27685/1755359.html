			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Void Ship" built with corpses has very thin air, so the sound is hollow and heavy. The squadron marched neatly and stepped forward on the bumpy ground until it stopped before the bronze gate. Then, they entered the hall one by one, sitting in the throne in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is concerned about Siegel, the silence here is crazy. The skull on the surrounding walls constantly shoots the beam and engraves it on the body. Some have succeeded, some have not withstood the transformation, melted like a candle, and flowed down from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is hesitant because of the failure of his predecessor. They are lined up in a neat team and accept the challenge of transformation without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel quietly observes the process of transformation. None of the patterns on these soldiers can match their own complexity, and no one is more intense. He found that some of the more sturdy, more structured shackles, their patterns were slightly more complicated, and the transformation took longer, but still less than half of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the time, the more likely it is to fail, and even those who are strong will be destroyed in the transformation. Only about half of the cockroaches can be upgraded, they will get up and leave from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waited patiently, and silence and order were his biggest helpers. He said to himself in his heart: Do not do sudden and chaotic actions, some of which are regular. Observe, learn, imitate, and find a way to go back. Let Nexus think of himself as one of them, but be sure to remember his true identity and remember the feeling of being alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last scorpion soldier came up and sat on the throne, and it failed. Siegel quickly and quickly took two steps, pretending to follow the success of the previous transformation, and step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mixed into the ranks of the warriors, left the throne hall, and set foot on the purple-red ground. Because of the use of corpse transformation, the ground here is a little soft. The thick stratum corneum is tough, and the green plasma line is buried deep under the ground, constantly emitting green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, there are things scattered from the various collapsed worlds. It should have been a tall hall. Now there are only broken columns and broken masonry. The original holy and beautiful figures are carved with distorted faces squinting around. In the labyrinth of ruins, several lucky grasses hang low in the dirt. Body - there is no sun or water, and they will soon die dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw the shadow of many bodies. They have the physical characteristics of men, women, and children, which are branded on the wall and printed underground. Most of them are like bows, fingers, and painfully huddled into a ball, apparently taste the pain before death. Several cockroaches were holding instruments like mops, brushing their shadows and screwing them into gray lead barrels, not knowing how they would be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are squadrons everywhere, they are like moving ants, dividing the ruins into small pieces and carrying them one by one. Siegel saw the mucus clots buried under the masonry. Now it has become thick and turbid pus, and there is no form at all. The glory and vitality of the past has now become wreckage and memories, and remains in the void like digested food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these wrecks, tall black slate can be seen everywhere, and the seven twists and turns are standing on the ground like a piece of tombstone on the burial post. The smooth and smooth surface of the slate is shining with green lines, and there is a sense of epitaph. This is almost exactly the same as the slate found in the underground of the Rim Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of the soldiers went forward and looked around quietly. In addition to the humanoid scorpion, there are crawling crickets with similar beetle shells, scorpion scorpions with arms for the sharp edges, and dragon scorpions with their tails behind their tails. They are silent and busy. Decompose the wreckage of a world like a bald eagle eating a corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nethership floats quietly in the void, and is unaware that it is moving until it rises from the "horizon" to a reference. It was a broken island, almost three times the size of Heim's collar. It was torn from the original world and is making a circular motion around the "empty ship." From the far side you can see the villages, the castles and the roads connecting the fields, and the trees covered with fruits surround the low hills. There is no drop of water in the criss-crossed canals, leaving only dry sand in the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they reached the side of the Nethership, they fell like hail, smashing on the stratum corneum, and many plasma circuits were damaged during the impact. The various shackles of Nexus will come forward to sort out the materials that are attracted, while constantly repairing the damaged ground. Siegel thought of the locusts attached to the corpse, which was as crowded and busy as the scene in front of him. He resisted the discomfort in his heart and forced himself to watch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of sound sounded like a bee swarm. The scepter, who was originally a beetle-like, unfolded the transparent wings of the thin wings, carrying the warriors to take off and killing the floating continent. The three aborigines are holding wooden sticks and fighting the warriors. They are strong and have a layer of glowing inexplicable energy on the outside, which allows them to fly in the air, providing protection and breaking through the defenses of the warriors. If they talk about martial arts, they are all above the warriors, whether they are strength, speed or skill, but the difference in quantity is too big. Soon, they were flooded by thousands of tidal waves, and the screams that came out of death seemed to be heard through the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bodies of their bodies, and the parts of the warriors who were demolished by them, were also shipped back together and placed on black slate. Under the guise of green light, the warriors were quickly reassembled and repaired, and the trembling stood up. The color of the engraved on them is lighter, just like a defective product. These warriors have the opportunity to continue to undergo transformation, and if they fail, they become basic wax-soluble substances and reshape them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel found the opportunity to leave the team, standing next to the bodies of the three aborigines, he had to know the ability of Nexus and the use of slate. The plasma climbed onto the body, corroded the flesh and blood, and gradually peeled off from the bones, and was carried away by the warriors. A thumb-sized inflammatory soul crystal condensed from the chest of the body, and was quickly picked up by the beetle passing by and sent to the throne. Everything is done in an orderly manner until there is only one complete skeleton left in front of the slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the green engravings slowly climbed up to form the simplest swirl pattern. Another new Nethers warrior stood up and joined the army waiting for the upgrade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throne hall of the skull shape, the next batch of Nexus fighters began to enter and exit. At this rate, it will soon reach a dozen. The number of million. How can such a powerful army resist? Siegel couldn’t think of it, at least with the mortal army there was no hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the gods can withstand these forces, but the rulers will not give them the opportunity to interfere in mortal battles. According to Monroe, if you want to survive, you can only save yourself. Siegel knew that his prayers to God had never worked, and he could only rely on himself and the twenty scorpions on his chest. He began to understand that becoming a dead soul and plasma immunity is a very important ability, much more important than the survival of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to find the "top spire" of the "Void Ship", where there are devices and portals for searching the world. The prepared General Nass will also set off from there and set foot on the slate to the world that will be destroyed. They will cooperate with the ruler to close the kingdom of God and accelerate its destruction process, thus creating more shadows of the soul. There is a map of the location of the route, where there is a "boundary map" and "boundary door", there is a way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place that is so important is to dominate the area of ​​focus, what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an adventure, much more dangerous than in the Orc City of Makarbu. He knows this very well, so he carefully observes and tries to integrate with the surrounding environment. He walked through the streets and ruins and walked through the "flesh and blood". As long as there is a place where the Hindu warrior appears, he has to go and have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire "Void Ship" has a length of fifty miles, firmly attracting the surrounding material, and will not let Siegel fall into the void. He walked from one end to the other and looked around at Monroe's "Void Ship Steeple." But on the surface of the Void Ship, there is no place that can be called the "spider": there are round and gentle hills everywhere, except for the stone tablets, there is no higher and more pointed things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has traveled to the end of the Nethership, which is narrower and thinner than the other end, so it is called the tail end by Siegel. Looking out from this direction, the infinite black void is full of sight, even if it is a shackle, it gives rise to loneliness and fear. For a time, Siegel stood still, letting this emotion hold himself. The green lines on his body are flashing and brightening, like a light trying to illuminate the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the unchanging scenery will make people forget the passage of time, and as a beggar, there is no warning of fatigue, hunger and thirst, this will make this The situation has become more serious. The endless void attracts everything, including the soul of the soul. Unconsciously, it will pull Siegel's mind out of his eyes, and the longer it grows, the more it will gradually dissipate in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
