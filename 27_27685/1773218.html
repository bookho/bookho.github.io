			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be busy, I am Siegel. Squid." The lord spread his hands and said that he did not hold weapons, wands or casting materials. "Mr. Edith, when did you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf stunned, but the action of casting the spell did not stop. In addition to triggering his own protective spells by feeling the evil light, he also nested defenses against the dead and negative energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not move, lest it cause unnecessary trouble. Siegel thought that it would be necessary to explain how he became this kind of respect for a while, but he certainly could not disclose the existence of the twenty-faced scorpion. Many mages are studying the Necromancer spells and want to use the characteristics of the undead to deal with various dangerous environments. But all along, the dead spirit has various shortcomings, the spell has never been perfected, it is impossible to reach the current level of Siegel, it is impossible to push it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Idis was performing protection, his brains were running fast. This matter must appear to be justified and cannot allow the other party to find the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf has been holding on to the impulse to attack the evil spirits, looking up and down the opposite guy. Obviously, the opposite person casts illusion and makes his face look like Siegel. The true essence is 骷髅. But the voice of his speech is not like a fake, and there is no hostile action until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the transmission lights up in turn, and the disciples and assistants of Edith arrived. The half-elf stopped the aggressive spells that other wizards began to recite, but did not prevent them from applying protective spells to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show your magic badge." Idis said to Siegel: "Don't let me see other gestures of the spell, hear even a mistake. Syllables!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, according to the words. The nine tentacles of the black squid are vivid, and the eyes are still braving the bright red flame. From the magical fluctuations of the emblem, Edith saw the characteristics belonging to Siegel, but this still does not reassure him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mage Lord Siegel has a unique ability among all human wizards. Can you show it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf rune shines in the air, which can't be forged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are Siegel." Idis waved and calmed the magical array. "How did you become like this? Why did someone cast a curse on you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This spell is called a curse?" Siegel asked: “How have I never heard of it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This spell can only be cast with the help of a specific mage tower, so there is no record in any spell book.” Half The elf said: "The Zero Tower of the Federation's Power Tower and the Masters Association can meet the standards. But the Zero Tower is not built in the New World, and its scope cannot cover you, so only the Federation is possible." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is already obvious, only Casper can completely use the power tower. The curse of the big curse must come from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you get rid of this thing?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you control the power tower, you can turn off this spell." The half-elves suddenly thought it was very interesting, and came close to see it. "I really haven't heard of anyone who can survive under the curse of the big curse. You become a dead soul, how do you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegel took a small bottle from the space bag and showed it to Edith. The liquid in the bottle exudes the same rich undead. The degree of evil does not have to be a great curse. "This is what the Faranes gave me, the lich turned into a potion. It was with the potion that I was lucky enough to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be kidding! "The first reaction of Idis is not to believe: "All know that the Lich conversion agent can only be used by the manufacturer. For others, it is a mortal poison. If you dare to drink even a little bit, immediately kill your life." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that Dr. Faranis doesn't know this? He knows that he is going to die, and he gave me this bottle of medicine. Is it just to poison? I am so simple?" Siegel shook his head and guided the thoughts of the half-elf. "He asked me to study this pharmacy and said that I would use it one day. I thought he was referring to ways to extend his life. I didn't expect it to be a curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long can you stay in this state of sorrow? The curse is not stopped forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me in detail?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the special design of the Magic Tower, the wizards can strengthen their level of spell control. The Great Curse is a combination of prophecy, change, and Necromancer spells. This spell positions the caster's magical fluctuations. Then hit the magical effects and biological characteristics of the body. Once the magic array is turned on, it will automatically continue to run until the target dies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the superposition of the characteristics of the change spell, no matter how the target hides, it makes no sense. Unless you use the door to the outside world to travel to other worlds. For example, if you enter the void like the last time, you can get rid of the scope of this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This spell consumes a lot of magic towers and can seriously affect the protective enchantment of the Three Peaks Tower," said Edith, then looked at the West with admiration. Geer: "What did you do to make that old thing so hate you, actually use this spell to strike?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that I am doing at the hub The thing was discovered by him." Siegel swayed his head proudly. "Now the elf is going to beat him, so he is angry and angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard about the elves, and their preparations have been very secretive, including None of the Masters Association found it, and it was hard to see it.” Idis replied: “When I left, I didn’t expect that so many things could happen during this time. The New World is full of wind and rain.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to this, Siegel quickly asked about the plan of the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Naceus is the enemy of life and death in any world. The Masters Association has mobilized and will not tolerate it." Idis said: "Consider the Wraith and There may be a tolerance for the squad, and the association is preparing for it. You can rest assured that Knox has not had many good days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You came back from yourself?" Siegel also hoped that the Masters Association would send a helper, at least to strengthen his side. Now the Sanfeng Pagoda in Deepwater City is still under the control of the Knox Association, so the place where the Masters Association can stay is the Heim Collar. There is no other skill in Siegel, and the level of people tied to the chariot is high enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I hurried back after reporting. All the way by boat. The meaning of the association is to let me bring the things that are given to you first." Idis paused and then opened the entrance to the Union’s underground library, letting Siegel enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong negative energy is pervasive in the library, and the anti-evil law here does not play any role. The anti-transport barrier also prevents the curse from positioning Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I can't be outside for a while." Siegel said with self-deprecating: "Otherwise, it must become a key strike for the guardians of justice." Evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will open a room for you, at least to cover up the strong evil light in you, and also avoid these negative energy affecting your territory. People," Idis said as he opened his space bag and took out a staff: "As you enter the void. Provide important information related to Knox, Neckar and Dominator, Masters Association Decided to give you a defensive staff as a reward. This staff is from the hands of the protective sergeant Wardhouse, a rare treasure that is also suitable for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff looks ordinary, with an iron around the iron rod and a turbid opal on top of the pole. There is neither a spell engraving nor a slight magical fluctuation, just like an ordinary walking stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the weakness of this staff in my hand. The rattan wrapped around it slowly twisted to form a grip suitable for Siegel's palm and conformed to his height and arm habits. The defensive staff is still adjusting the weight and center of gravity. It will not affect the speed of waving, nor will it lose power in the block because it is too light. The general mage may not be aware of this, but Siegel has experienced the training of the dwarf Elinte, who is familiar with the effects of weapon structure and material on the battlefield performance and will not miss this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can only be said that the protective ** division Wardhouse must also be proficient in weapons manufacturing, otherwise they will not notice these details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the staff can know its purpose and power as long as it is in the hand. In addition to the various shield spells, the Defence Staff can also be used as a weapon for blocking. Masters don't need very deep martial arts, they only need to pass the mind command. Let the defensive staff play the "unmoved" character and then block it in front of you. The enemy's weapons are cut, just like hitting a solid pillar, and you can't open it. It also hurts the mage behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
