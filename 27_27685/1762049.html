			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireplace is re-ignited, but the dishes inside are still boiled beans. The man with a pockmark is very sorry to tell the guests that if the meat flutters out, it will lead to people in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of knight is that, it is worse than a robber. Close the barn, take away the food, and search for every copper plate. Listen They said that they still went to the remote village to rob, and God knew what bad things they had done. Although there was no lord and no object of allegiance, should the Cavaliers still protect the weak?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sits close to the fireplace, gently licking the turbid ale, a dry bitterness that fills the mouth. "The people of Ampa have never returned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I didn't see any Anpa, who should have died on the battlefield of the squid's house." The shopkeeper said: "That is terrible. There are fire everywhere, and there are fangs and hell dogs. The coalition forces are killing each other. No one knows what they are doing. They run in a random direction. All the roads are blocked." A sword stabbed, it is not easy to find a way to live. Hey, in fact, it is the same now, everywhere is fighting, good and bad, bad and bad, even good and good people have begun to fight. I heard that the road is terrible, Robbers and beasts not only have flocks of crows and lynxes, but even rabbits start to bite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bunny? The Ulle family of Fanghe Lin?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is them." The man said, "You came here from Heim, and you must be going east. Now you can't get through. Ulle The family closed the border and only the person who put down the weapon could enter. But after entering it, it is hard to say, maybe it will be robbed. The two adults must not let go of the sword and kill them, so if I were you, I would avoid the present path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all dregs," Siegel replied in an understatement: "Let them try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still a good thing." Mazi face man sighed: "I am also playing The people who have passed, the master of Anpa has not survived the battlefield, I survived, but I know why, not four words, away from trouble. In this year, life is more important than anything. Why use the neck to try the sharpness of the sword In addition, Baron Cui Mengde.Ul is not dead, and there is a sword made of lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows this rabbit baron, he is A few southern aristocrats who did not participate in the coalition. It is said that this person has a wide range of interests. But never including sword riding. His territory has the best chicken, duck, cattle and sheep, and the sweetest honey in the South is also a specialty of his territory. Janet once mentioned that this is a mysterious lord who rarely appears. Now it has become a farmer, and even her contractors have planted crops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine such a person robbing a passing passenger. However, if they really closed the border, they did not want to detour. A few ordinary levels can't stop the Master, and he has a way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Siegel is still very grateful to the store’s reminder, so he also gave his own advice: “Although many places are still fighting, I am from Heim’s collar. Come, know that there is peace. There are no robbers in the control area of ​​the squid lord, and all the knights also have the look of a knight. Why don't you go there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men wrinkle I raised my brow and then shook my head: "Don't say if I can take my daughter safely. What life do I use when I get there? Now it's autumn, I'm going to get into the winter. What do I eat? After farming, I will go to the end of next summer. There was new food, but at that time our father and daughter had already starved to death. Now there is an inn, not afraid of the sun and the rain, we can still eat stewed beans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s as good as you said, why do you have to face with a machete when we appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This problem caused the scene to be silent, and even Moore put down the spoon and bread, waiting for the owner's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not a mercenary? Are the mercenaries all mischievous and will not pay gold coins to pay the bill." The man returned: "You are not a nobleman." After all, there aren't even family crests. The thieves won't have such good equipment as you. And their skills in raising horses are very poor, and the mounts are not like yours. Tell me, who are you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel draws a silver medal from the wrist of his left hand, with the emblem of the god of warriors: the long sword and the longbow that are placed crosswise before the shield. Surrounded by an arrow into an ellipse. The Brown family presented this gift to Siegel, hoping that the two can share a common faith. Although it is very funny to let a mage believe in the god of warriors, this is, after all, the custom of the Brown family, and Siegel still has to show respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore felt very embarrassed and immediately bowed his head and continued to eat. Avoid others seeing his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s smile put the man on the alert, and he told the truth: “The day before yesterday, Dick Knight and his companions who lived in the castle came. Drinking here, they just cleared a thief camp outside - at least they claimed it - the battle was very intense, so the mouth was dry. I had a nap, I know that there are beasts in the man's heart, I have tasted the blood. After that, it will be released. At that time, Dick Knight stared at my daughter with a disturbing look. I guess he didn't make any good ideas. Just yesterday, he sent someone to send a gold coin, saying that this is a deposit, let I must accept it. I asked what the deposit was. The boy who sent the letter smiled, indicating that Dick Knight would come to me in the morning. If you want to escape, you can try to escape the four-legged hound and four legs. Ma. I have no choice, so when you came, I was sharpening the knife below. I didn't hear the sound of your horses, otherwise I wouldn't let my daughter show up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't say, Are you ready to leave here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I can’t believe you just now, so I’m talking about lies. The gods won’t blame.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No blame, only self-blame." Siegel said: "The paladin who is the god of warriors, if it can not bring the safety and happiness of the weak, how can God's kingdom is blessed? My hand-held shield is to protect the good from the wind and rain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of a lot of reading, even when necessary The prayers of the pastor can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man put his hands together and said with excitement: "Where should we go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't go anywhere, go get some meat for me, and then take a good sleep. Let's see what the Dick Knight is sacred in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner is still very Excited, went to the cellar with her daughter to take out a large piece of horse meat and put it in the pot. But then he began to worry again. Dick Knight has many friends. Can they do both? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Siegel closed his eyes and raised his mind, he was not idle. He commanded the raven to fly into the castle and begin investigations. It is not his style to wait for Dick Knight to come to the door, and he does not have so much time to delay. He casts invisible spells, so no one can see the black body of the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smell in the castle, which is the smell of red wine and food residue. After the knights occupied the castle, they lived a life of luxury, banqueting all day, eating meat and drinking, so fast. They seized the servants and forced them to tell where the treasures were hiding. In the chaos, most people ran away, and the rest were forced to stay and could not clean up the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without supervision, the so-called knight quickly became a robber. Siegel passed through the eyes of the transitional crow and saw this unbearable scene in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights are drunk in the hall, a pig is being flipped over the oven, it is slaughtered on the spot, the visceral side is on the side In the big basin, the earth is full of blood, but these people do not care. They held a glass of wine and shouted the names of the various lords in the south, and added a "go to fucking" remark in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven stopped at the beam of the hall and stared at everything coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should wish me a happy wedding and give me ten gold coins." A knight with a big waist stood up and spoke, waving his arm in the cup. Ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ten gold coins, is your brain crazy?" Another "Knight" reclined on the chair, reaching out to the long, hairy feet. The voice said rudely: "I heard that you spent a gold coin, how dare you give us ten?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person laughed loudly:" You are really good to buy and sell! But trying to use the firewood girl to make us money, is it too simple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dick Knight spit on the ground, I slammed a sip of wine and said, "In the radius of this one hundred miles, there are still a few villages that have not been visited. You are telling me. You are happy every night, but I remembered me? Ten Gold coins are cheaper for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Put your dog stinky, you are a coward." A man with a black iron half helmet stepped on Before, I used the chicken legs in my hand as a short sword and said while waving: "What we said at the beginning, no matter what, we can’t move people around the castle castle. Do you think? Do everyone unite to drive us out? Where is the castle safe outside? You said that we are happy, it is because you are always at the end, coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
