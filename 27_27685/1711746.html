			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises from the horizon and shines from the bottom up on the face, which is a strange experience. Siegel stood on the platform of the entrance to the cave of Mora. Two months ago, he came to the dwarf kingdom from here and became a brave man. Now, he has to leave here again, with Lia master, dwarf Elinte and the barbarian Dio from the western plateau, set off for Longshi Cliff to complete his long-awaited adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a thick fur robe, equipped with the new armor that the dwarf gave him - a delicate black breastplate. The breastplate is smooth and flat, and the front and rear armor plates are made of pure steel and bundled with a brown leather belt. The edge of the breastplate is plated with a layer of copper, and the badge on the chest is dotted with the badge of the dragon and the private signature of Elinte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to continue to keep Siegel agile, he has no armor under his waist, just wearing thick warm pants. Non-slip boots and fur gloves are new, and the gold belt is attached to the waist. When Siegel stood on the platform of the snowy mountain and stood up against the sea of ​​clouds, it looked imposing and handsome. But his current hair is brown, supple and shiny - this is the technique he learned from the beauty of Elsa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the jazz left the dagger left in the boot, Siegel's weapon is also brand new. As a fighter to replace the jazz character, he needs to be able to cope with various combat situations. So he carried longbows, broad swords, scimitars, warhammers, flying axes, shields, and more than twenty arrows. Whether it is on the back, hanging on the waist or tied to the leg, and then counted on the armor, these equipment is more than 60 kilograms. If the strong body is not exercised, it is difficult to load. To know that this weight is enough to crush ordinary people, it is difficult to walk for a long time, let alone fight at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liya is still the equipment of the Elf Ranger, but wearing a new coat, added arrows. Under the persuasion of everyone, Dio was finally willing to be a little pony outside the upper body of the **, but it made him look more powerful - and sexy. The barbarian carries the "Wild Blessing Giant Wood Stick" from his tribe, and he has eight flying axes on his belt. He is holding the big blade of the dwarf to send him a big knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irenet appears to be more spacious after wearing his family's body, like a shovel that will be active. This armor is full of dents and is the damage that has been suffered in previous battles. The dwarf can remember the history of every dent, and all of them have been told to Siegel, more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these few people, there are four full-time followers behind them. The dwarf Elinette organized all aspects of the adventure, including planning and adding equipment, and naturally hired entourage – including coachmen, camp guards, messengers and a servant who would cook. These four followers are from the gem clan and have been working for Elin, who can be trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight people set off at dawn and descended from the slow road of Mora. The messenger was at the forefront of the team, and his white coat was embroidered with the golden emblem of the gem clan core aristocracy. So the other people they met -- as long as they know the meaning of the badge -- let the road open and let them go first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot going down the mountain. They bought a carriage in the middle of the mountain, two scorpions and a horse. The coachman came in handy, and he drove forward, allowing the adventurers to rest. The messenger ran after riding the horse, both for investigation and for arranging a stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned to the north after coming to the foot of the mountain, always along the edge of the mountain, the tall peaks stood on their west side, so every afternoon it was already The shadows are shrouded, and sometimes even the torch is going forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall mountains block the sun, which is also a difficult environment for the plants around. In many places, the bare grass is not born, and in some low-lying places, it is even covered with moss. There is no farmland here, and few people smoke, but some mines are here. The miners collect large stones, make building materials, and make a living for them. Their lives are monotonous and boring, and they can barely make ends meet for a hard day. Therefore, these people are always working hard to bow their heads, and they ignore the passing of Sigel and his party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering this wilderness, the servants and coaches have already filled the carriages, which are easy to store foods, they will first eat some perishable vegetables. And carefully calculate the drinking water. Barbarian Dio, dwarf Elinte and Siegel are big belly, they must control the diet, only the least weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't be careless when taking risks," said Dwarf Elinte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, you will start the uphill road again – or along the dry valleys of the mountains, or the bottom of the valley where the mudslides washed down, slowly moving forward, and everyone will come down to help the cart. Elijah Lia is light in weight and can climb up to the heights very quickly, observing the surrounding situation and guarding the wagon around the sentinel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found a flat camp to rest in the evening, the chef prepared food for them, sent the letter and the guard to set up the tent, the driver was taking care of the livestock. Three strong warriors cut firewood. The wood here is tough and hard, and the trees take a long time to grow a little, so it is extraordinarily strong, but it is burning and the fire is very strong. Half of the sky at night is the shadow of darkness. It is the winding Mora Mountains, which shields the moon behind; only the other side of the night sky, the stars can shine. The wind whistling in the valley, but it could not hold the bark of the barbarians. Siegel was stunned and couldn't sleep, so he got up and moved, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two were awake, the guard and the dwarf Elinette. They are responsible for the middle of the night before the end of the elf meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to drink, young man!" The dwarf sat by the fire and said, "Drink some hot tea, drive the cold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go in a minute." Siegel waved at him, then took off the leather armor, put on the breastplate again, and took the weapon with him. . This is the habit that Sir Bill made him develop. In the wild, as long as you get up, you must be fully armed to deal with emergencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea has a bitter taste and is very difficult to swallow. This is not really a real tea. It is just a special herb that removes dirt from the water to get water that can be safely consumed in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eilet, have you not left Mora for a long time? Will you miss home?" Siegel holding the teacup in both hands, sitting Next to the campfire, ask the dwarf: "I noticed that you often look back on the way you come. Sometimes you will watch the mountain for a long time, and you may not notice it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the child is right. I haven't left the cave for a long time. Do you know? When the cold wind came over, I suddenly felt that I was young again. This is 3 years. I’ve been almost forgotten, but it’s not homesick, just some emotions!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene patted Siegel’s shoulders and then showed up A smile, "Children, don't let us old guys affect your mood, I just stayed in the cave for too long, didn't come out to exercise, and didn't even pick up the hammer to make weapons for a long time. The breastplate on your body I actually failed to assemble it twice, which was unimaginable in the past. Do you know what I used to be called? Irene--hammer press! As a result, now I am doing hammering every day, but not in the forging room, but printing on endless documents and letters. You are still young, Siegel, you have a lot of good times to enjoy, adventure, fight, look for excitement, the best time of your life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Irene, when I was in the sea, I was very happy, I think it will last forever, but when the old captain left, I knew that happiness was over. Now I am taking risks with you, I am also very Happiness, but it seems that this is not likely to last forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so sentimental, you are not that old! When are you married? Give birth to a bunch of little scorpions, they are alive and kicking everywhere to trouble you; until you have an arrow in your knees, you can no longer go out and risk, you can only stay in the living room by the fireplace, you are qualified to be sentimental!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a hard time thinking That kind of life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s only a matter of time to see everything, no other shortcuts. Before that, you can think of something else. For example, treasure, a lot of treasures. Siegel, what do you think of my life, how is my wealth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to the king!" I thought about it and said: "Sometimes I listen to the poems of the kings sung by the bards in the pub, and their lives are just like you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this adventure is completed, you can live this life. I am not kidding at all. Longshi Cliff is the lucky of our four people." The dwarf's eyes narrowed and the beard was shaking because of laughter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How were these treasures discovered? I have never heard of this story. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
