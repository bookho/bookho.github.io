			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher who came in was a young human, a white robe and Siegel clothes were very similar in color, but his robes had gold at the corners. Moire decoration. He went to the podium after he first squatted, then whispered: "Today I am going to talk about the relationship between the system and the magic in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is talking about In-depth, simple language, but no effect on Siegel. Implicated by the wall of the storm, the wall of the thunder wall is even fake, not to mention the moon. The solitary silver moon even the werewolves are reluctant to pay attention, and the Master will not look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March system has formed three types of wizards, each of which has its own counterpart to the moon, and what magic can be used is God’s final say. The mage must pray to them. Whether this is a magician or a pastor, Siegel can't tell. In this respect, the Master of the Thunder Wall World is still full of freedom, that is, does not believe in the magic god, and there will be no defects in the ability to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf suddenly squeezed her eyes at Siegel and motioned him to look sideways. Siegel just raised his eyes as soon as he saw it: the elf with the mask dropped his hand to the side of his body, and a few creeping black bugs fell from his sleeves, which looked like a sly variant. The little worm hid under the seat and slowly climbed to a bald human mage, leaving a shallow moist mark behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not a good thing. You don’t need to detect evil to feel the yin that is emitted from those bugs. Siegel just wanted to make a reminder, and he saw the female elf making a squeaking gesture. "This is their business, you don't mix. They use points, they must be worthwhile, or they will be angry with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment Sigel hesitated, the black bug accelerated in an instant, and it stuck to the ankle of the bald human mage. The magical defense that should be protective did not take effect. The bug squirmed twice, found the position of the blood vessel, and then suddenly became smaller and slammed into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald man has some feelings. I reached out and scratched and found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Siegel just had to stand up and speak, but the teacher who was being lectured called. "The white-haired old man can tell me how to leave room for his companions when he uses the fireball?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿. Bald, yours The body was drilled by black bugs," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young white robes of the white robe stunned, and everyone’s eyes turned to the bald human mage. The man patted the body, recited a few spells, and let the magic of detection see through itself. He shook his head. Said to Siegel: "Do you look at it? I am good, where are the bugs in my body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just now, masked sleeves The black bug fell and bite into your ankle. You should check it out more." The Siegel voice just fell, and the person on the platform interrupted: "Your answer is incorrect, deduct 40. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! This is simply a matter of course!" Siegel turned to look at the teacher and was angry at his indiscriminate practice. Elf Anna reminded me at the side: "Don't hit the teacher, those are magic towers that are illusory. They are not real people at all, so they don't talk about it. You just kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down. Who else can answer this question and get ten points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish hands raised the fastest He replied, "Using the spell to shape, you can change the shape and avoid hurting yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lecturer is not convinced, but re-exports: "Now I introduce to you. A spell, a variant of fireball, called a cremation pyre. It uses multiple bursts to generate power without causing troublesome diffuse effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; He did not say anything extra points, but the gnome did not propose it. It seems that the process of adding points is secret. Siegel asked about the god of lights. It is forbidden to inquire other people's points. As a result, no one knows what other people have scores, and they don't know how they use this score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel lost the score, except for the female elf Anna with a pity on her face. Others are either gloating or expressionless. The lecturer spoke incessantly about the spell he invented, and Siegel listened boredly. He was again named twice, and after getting the correct answer, he got thirty, which was to make up for his losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, there was no class, and the Bald Master suddenly stood up, his face pale, licking his chest and retching. To this end, the mage of the lecture deducted him fifty and let him sit down immediately. Bald struggled for a moment, finally sitting on a chair, but also "wow" a spit out a lot of black sewage. The people next to them quickly evaded, for fear of splashing on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black, suede-like dry sac in the effluent, just like the black worm that proliferates in his body and mutates. The bald man has completely lost his ability to control the body. He can't stop spilling black sewage from his mouth, while lying on his chair and twitching hard. From the white eyes that he turned up, the energy of lightning continued to overflow, accompanied by the blood that could not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, the bald head smashed down, like a deflated ball. A large number of slender black lines emerged from his pores, and then gathered together and twisted into clews, squirming and crawling toward the mask elf mage. The man raised his robes and let the black worms go in. When he put down the corner of the robe, everything was shielded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher of the lecture again punished his 100 points in the name of "pollution of the environment" and then continued the lecture. Siegel understood this time that the so-called lecturer is nothing but a shackle generated by the kingdom of God. He does not have a true character at all. They can only deal with things mechanically and repeatedly, with no trace of feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who listen to the class have a lot of emotions, but they can’t say that they must be real people. Siegel looked at the bald body on the ground and pinched his chin thoughtfully: If this is a dummy of the Kingdom of God, why do they kill each other? What is it so complicated to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is over, everyone stands up and ready to leave, the masked elf does not go to the gate, but walks in the direction of Siegel. "You have a lot of mouths, old things, don't worry about anything." The voice of the man was wet and awkward, like a slimy slug. "If you open more, you may have bugs in it, and eat your heart, liver, spleen and lungs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although try it. The bug's guy, your little tricks have been deceived." Siegel was not timid, the staff was heavy on the ground, and the flame rose from his feet. In the white robe, the red color is reflected: "How much I will die if I come over, I am afraid that you will not have the material for casting soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maskist just wants When I spoke, the teacher’s voice rang: “Gasker, you have the highest score now, you can go to the second floor after class.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be early Ready. The mask man turned and walked away, grabbing the bald body. Along with the golden light on the back side of the podium, a spiral-shaped transparent step appeared in front of everyone. The mask man named Gaskell stepped onto the steps and carried the body away from everyone's view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the second floor?" Siegel spent five points to ask, only to get the answer to the "God Practice". After the mask man went up, the lecturer waved his hand and the steps disappeared. He also turned into a burst of blue smoke in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ou Luoyin, now I know, sitting in the middle is the most likely to be called to answer questions. The easiest to get points. Although you are losing money this time, but Always catch up." Elf Anna smiled and comforted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bald mage..." Siegel looked at the female elf in confusion. "You don't care about his situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is dead, what kind of heart?" The elf said: "You just want to save people, you also need to pay points, and according to the sum of the attackers and defenders. At least 500. Especially if there is no income, who can afford it? Here you can only take care of yourself and be careful to guard against others. You can say that you have done the best, he does not believe and can not find out. Can blame Who? Are you responsible for every stupid person?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: “Then I can’t take it. I understand you. I take care of my own way of doing things, but why have you been particularly enthusiastic about me? According to common sense, I am the murderer who killed the gnome once here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elf quickly shook his head. "That can't represent a fierce. It's just that the gnome has provoked you." If it is me, I will not be merciful. I am studying the prophetic spells, the intuition is very accurate, I have never made a mistake. My instinct tells me that you are a safe choice, even if you don't help me. Will not harm me without cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, you won't regret it." The elf bent over and said that the covenant had been made. "Although the way of time flow is very weird, there are always nine people, and there are always people who come early and some people come late. Based on me, half-orcs and mask men are coming earlier than me, you are the latest. One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can a gnome be resurrected, but a bald one can't?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every reorganization requires two hundred points, and must be immediately smashed out, can not owe. The gnome has left, but the bald score is not enough. I Observed you, you are definitely a negative score now, even if it is more than zero, it is very limited. You are very unsafe, so you must get points as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I want is the final victory, not the points. Siegel would like to say this, but he must at least insist on observing it for a while before finding a way to crack the rules of the kingdom. When the points are negative, in addition to being deducted, you can't take the initiative to spend the points - you must pay the debt before you can borrow. This will bring considerable inconvenience to the usual. Anna did not explain in detail what was inconvenient, but took Siegel to where the points could be earned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor of the Magic Tower is a classroom, but when it is not lectured, this is the copy room. Siegel was taken out of the door by Anna and immediately turned back. It was only the time to open and close the door, and the look in the room was completely changed. The semi-circular table arrangement becomes a row and column style, and each table has a number of files and blank scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This style reminds Siegel of the Magic Association. Although he has not been to himself, but the old man who listened to the Federation said that the association has such a copy room, apprentices, intern trainers, and formal mages work hard here to protect books with slaps, using the magic of scrolls. Seal the spell. Each member of the association is required to turn in a certain number of reels each year, and cannot be replaced by other means, such as paying money or magic materials. Therefore, the Masters Association will have such a large number of book transcripts, and when they do not borrow or support, they will be particularly angry with the Masters of the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things on each table are different, and no one knows what is inside before turning it over." Elf Anna said: "There is something inside." There are some things that are very partial. There is no way to copy them. Once you sit down and open, you can either copy them, the accuracy rate will reach the standard, or you will consider it abandon. The corresponding score will be deducted. We have tried, unless Your foundation is very, very bad, otherwise this life is still earned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the content is different," Siegel asked: "Remuneration Is it the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not. Some have only a few points. Some have hundreds of them, and this has nothing to do with the difficulty, only Can rely on luck." Anna licked her nose: "I tried, using prophecy and intuition are useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Siegel has a way. When he turned back, he felt that there was a weak but interesting magical fluctuation in the copying room. It does not appear as continuous as the lines of the line, but constantly jumps in the room, appearing and disappearing irregularly. If it was a few days ago, Siegel would think that this is a free element that the environment unintentionally leaks. But after studying the fire for a long time, he had a new understanding of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of determinism is probability, even if there is a chaos behind the chaos. Siegel walked around the room. Use your keen elemental awareness to draw a magical topographic map of the entire room, and then find out a few key nodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaping element rarely comes to these positions, but according to Siegel's calculations, this is the biggest probability. He sat down and flipped through the books and found that it was just a simple non-magic copy. Although it is a kind of text that Siegel does not know at all, as long as it is not a scroll, it is difficult to get ordinary books with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel performed a slap recording technique and quickly got the task on the seat. At the same time, Elf Anna also picked a position at random. Head down busy. The lamp god floated over and told Siegel that he had scored forty points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this way becomes positive, Siegel thinks. He found the next place, and after opening it was a very simple task. When Anna finally finished the first job at hand. Siegel has already finished three copies, and has reached one hundred and twenty points, and forty can get it right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, this time there are twenty-seven points, it doesn’t take me half a day." Anna stretched out and didn’t seem to care about the "old man" Eyes. "How are you. Is the score correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this problem, Siegel could not answer. He knows what it is, but he can't tell it. If you don't study the experience of Shenhuo, even if you understand the uncertainties and probabilities in the world, there is no way to apply this theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth, I found it by chance. I can't teach you." Siegel spread his hand and said to Anna: "The phenomenon here." It is also changing, you can't even remember the seat number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf nodded hard and said: "Yes, I believe in you. Your ability." Very useful, after all, the more points you have, the more likely you are to get to the top. You can bring me this trick, and I will teach you a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She opened her own space bag and took a magic scroll from it and put it on Sigel’s hand. "This is not for you, just lend it to you. If you sell it to the lamp god, I will be very angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is said on the mouth, she also stroked her hand and let Siegel sell the reel to the lamp god. This second anchor spell only changed five points, far less than the gnome's staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has already guessed this approach, but still wants to listen to Elf Anna in detail. "Ownership is not something of its own, and it must be a magical item made entirely of materials outside, so that it can be sold to the lamp god in exchange for points. So I can't give it to you, you can only steal it or lend it to you. If you use the materials in the room to make magic items, even if you can use them normally, you can't change anything. You must be careful not to be deceived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anna then gave Siegel a lot of hidden rules of the Magic Academy, some of which were explored through experience, while others were exchanged with points and lights. "The rules of the points are very complicated. No one can say that they are all mastered. If you have any new discoveries, you can tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond you There are only half-orcs and mask elves in the early days. You are also a veteran here. Why didn’t you leave?” Siegel tempted and asked: “You didn’t care if you were the ultimate winner, just want to learn here. But do you know where this is? Or in other words. How did you get to this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original kind face disappeared, Elf Anna Converging smile, frost appeared in both eyes. Although there is no feeling of magic or elemental fluctuations, Siegel has an intuition that Anna does not need to reveal signs. The spell can be cast at any time. He knows that this issue has involved everyone's biggest secret, which is the true identity. The lamp god strictly forbids the use of spying, which must be considered and reflects the importance of this issue. Siegel did not use spells, but asked questions in disguise. He took a lot of risk, just want to know how important this matter is to the "old man" who has been in the magic school for a long time. Under the ebullient appearance, what kind of character is Elf Anna? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf stepped back and his fingers trembled slightly. However, the magic was not released and the battle did not break out. "The Magic Academy has a rule. If I know your identity, then defeat you, and then pay a certain amount, you can always drive you out of school. The more detailed the identity information, the less points you will spend, and before you beat the opponent. You don't know how much you will spend. So I can't tell you the answer to this question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and understood, changed the problem "What do you want most from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on the fourth floor, learn the secrets of legendary spells, master all the legendary magic seeds." Anna said: "I need to bring a specific spell to my hometown. This magic school is the most likely place. Unfortunately, the fourth floor is very expensive and requires six thousand points to stay for one day. I am waiting for the college's mage to release the task. , find someone to go there to clean or help. Then I can have hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you use the power of everyone, let you go to the fourth floor early, then let Are you going home directly? Such a forerunner has a great advantage for the latecomers, others are difficult..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s words have not finished, they hear the magic tower outside One sound. Two people are surprised. The conversation was terminated and came out. The masked elf mage is falling on the ground, with a shallow pit underneath. He seems to be falling directly from a very high place, the bones in his body have been smashed, leaving only one black and one variety of bugs appearing under him, or escaping into the mud to escape, or to the nearest live People climbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
