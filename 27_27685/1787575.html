			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel passed the narrow door next to the kitchen as quickly as possible, agilely avoiding the vat of garbage on one side, but he could not avoid being scared Black cat looking for rubbish. The cat screamed and jumped out of the vat and jumped up the roof a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burst of light slammed from the direction of the stable and quickly extinguished, and the frightened horse shouted. The knocking of the metal slammed, and a missed stone bomb flew into the backyard and slammed into the small tree by the river. The branches shook, the leaves fell, and they fell on the three nobles who were deforming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transformation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel saw that they had fangs, their skin turned pale, and the pupil became the clearest blue. From the corners of their eyes to the ears and down the cheeks and then under the armpits, the dark red tattoos faintly glow. They had the same claws as the dagger, and the claws were holding sharp long daggers with blood troughs. Their servants were all on the ground, their foreheads were in contact with the earth, their hands were spread out in the palm of their hands, and their eulogies were whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vampires? You must be joking." Siegel took out the dust of the star and took a small bottle from his pocket.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The undead dispels!" Arnold yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright ripple sweeps across the yard, with plenty of positive energy. The Mother of the Earth showed her sword, and Arnold was the one who waved the sword. The vampire rushing to the front mourned and painfully caught his eyes. His skin, which was exposed to the outside, was like a strong acid, and began to show the true look - the rotting dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smashes the holy water bottle on the sword, and then uses a pair of gloves to make the weapon more injurious to the undead creature. This is naturally not comparable to the sacred weapon directly blessed by the pastor, but relying on the original power of the Stardust should be enough to deal with these three vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly fell into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two male and female vampires who are not injured have a tacit understanding, and the action is lightning fast. Their daggers crossed the defense of the Stardust. Incisions are constantly left on Siegel's defensive shield. Their bodies are strikingly flexible and often make unreasonable movements, such as the use of elbows like a whip. Reverse the joint to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured vampire took a few steps back and took a bottle of thumb-sized black viscous potion from his pocket. Tuck it into the mouth with the bottle and then chew it hard. His injuries were also quickly restored with the sound of Karakala with glass fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thorn in the ribs of Siegel, forcing him to take a step back, closer to the direction of the three Tin Man. Siegel had no choice but to know that he could only win in a short period of time with his sword skills. In addition to the instinct of the dead spirit monsters, these two vampires also tried to hone their martial arts, just like a swordsman with a pursuit. They also continue to apply their spell power. Use illusion to create the illusion of a trick, to confuse the defender. If you encounter the kind of barbarians who are big and big, or the fully armed tin cans, you will definitely ignore these scams and attack yourself. But for the dwarf martial arts users who want to see three tricks, Siegel, only distinguish The opponent's offensive direction consumes a lot of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the light of lightning came from behind him, and then the hammer hit the metal jar, it seems that Sol used to hang on the waist. Quake Hammer. Naria shouted: "The child is already out, Jay. You can do it all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really can see me, Siegel Thought. The all-out attack means to hurry to win? He drew a vertical arc in front of the star dust and pulled back a little further. At the same time, the right hand draws a little powder in the material package of the waist. It's like igniting a fire with a match. The fire element gathers in his right hand at a very fast speed, and the rising flame burns extremely fiercely, and even emits a whistling whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire's blue pupil is full of red reflections, and they exclaimed to bounce backwards, trying to escape the flames. The flame snarls the sound of the blast, under the command of Siegel, like a giant claw, directly on the chest of the female vampire. Only heard a bang, the vampire's black body burned on the ground, her limbs struggled. Wriggle, trying to extinguish the flame on the body. But all this is in vain. Siegel has a word, and the elements of fire are constant. It took only three or four seconds to completely burn it to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonsense, what hell fire?!" Siegel is not a devil, how can he use the fire of hell? He turned his right hand in one direction, and the flame turned to the second vampire. He felt the burning heat coming from behind, and madly jumped into the sky, trying to deform in the broad daylight. It's one thing to reveal the shape, and the damage from using illusion is not great, but it will definitely hurt if you become a bat in the sun. Vampires definitely weigh the dangers of the sun and the flames. It is better to choose to recover from injury than to be swallowed by flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siegel's flame whip is faster than it thinks, and the pure fire element is more powerful than the flames that rely on fuel. Bats are smaller and turn into fly ash faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded vampire still has glass fragments on his lips, and the muscles in his face are still squirming and constantly repairing. The death of the two companions completely lost his fighting spirit, and the companion just gave him a demonstration of the escape from the sky. He immediately rushed to the dock and simultaneously split five phantoms to influence Siegel's judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage is about to recite the spell, using multiple energy missiles to fly to all the vampires who escape to distinguish the authenticity. A smashing arrow with a flame passed over him, hitting the back of the vampire's knee accurately and letting him fall directly to the ground. The gnome Yao En pushed the glasses and took off the arrow that was biting in his mouth and wound it with a wrench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extraordinary observation!" Siegel sighed and rushed up, shrouded him with flames before the vampire climbed up from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the battle also scored the victory, Evan's lightning hammer and bonfire continued to attack, only a few rounds to win. "The routines that most knights will use have been seen thousands of times, and it's too good to deal with them." Evan said as he blinked at the face of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescued child sat on the wooden barrel next to the stable, shaking all over the body and saying thankfulness. "Take him inside," Yao said to Naria. "Give him something to eat and drink, let him recover, and let's talk about it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan refers to the four servants who are still on the ground. They have stopped singing, just shivering. "What about those few?" Evan asked. "They just look at everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes will remove the ammunition from the bow and re Hanging on the back: "Ai Meng. You and I went to ask them to see if you can find out some news. Saul, you are coming along. Maybe you can help. Arnold, Jay The mess is handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood next to the pastor and said with amazement: "You have a good command, really lucky. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yao En said that if you want to, you can do better than him." Arnold touched the emblem of his chest and said, "I hope." One day, the Mother of the Earth gave me the same insight and determination as Yao En, so that I can better serve the good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the insight, what do you mean by the gesture you just made behind?” Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh. This is the gesture of our team, which means finding evil and preparing to fight." Arnold said: "The mother of the earth will guide me, let me Better distinguish the existence of evil. My friends and I found that cultivating evil and doing good can make us smoother in our actions. I think this is the truth to help others benefit themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you are only using a simple spell to detect evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word pray is closer to some." Say: "I don't need to make specific gestures, use specific materials, and recite specific spells like Naria. I just pray to God in my heart, seek her help, and then everything happens. What is this? "Is it a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, of course, no problem. I was just thinking. Why didn't I notice that it was wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has always been very sensitive to magical effects and energy fluctuations, plus the scorpion gives The clairvoyant ability stands to reason that it should be able to see these people quirks. of course. It is certainly not a moral distinction. Whether they are good or evil, but at least they should also detect the negative energy of the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two bodies are placed in front of Siegel, he can quickly tell which one is a dead body and which one is a zombie. As a kind of necromancer, vampires have never recorded that they can shield negative energy perception. If it is achieved with some magical effect, where is the element fluctuating? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
