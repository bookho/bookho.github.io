			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry to the Zeeshan Gold Mine did not know what was going on behind them. They thought that the enemy was still ahead, and everything must be quick and fast. Because the torches have been ignited, they simply advance in the light. In order to avoid something similar to the pit, the cavalry pulled the team longer, with the three best riders on the front side marching side by side, and the people behind were a little farther away, following their footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no accident along the way, but William Uther knows that his actions must be discovered. However, he did not know what kind of countermeasures the other side would make besides the trapping horse pit, and it was more uncertain whether there was any precaution in the gold mine. Now he has become a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to intuition and years of tactical learning, he knows that his best choice now is to change the tactics, start sweeping the village of Heim, and force the peasants to escape. Built inside the castle. This will lay the foundation for the next siege. Although the siege war took a long time, he believed that it was impossible for Heim to have a lot of grain reserves, and that the lord called Siegel would soon be forced to fight for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he looked at the knights beside him, wondering how many people inside can understand such tactics? I can find some ale, pig and sheep in the village, but what does it compare with gold? If the leader is the father of his own lord, or the first heir to the territory - his brother, Marlock Uther, then this thing is okay. But he is only the second son in his family. His usual prestige is not high, especially if there is no gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he is now riding a tiger and can only fight to attack the Zeeshan Gold Mine according to the original plan. He gritted his teeth and ordered the cavalry to attack all night. "If you want to rest, you will have a better rest when you are holding gold in your arms," ​​he said, and then he hurried the horse again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mines of the Zebra Mountain are divided into two parts, the mountain and the lower part of the mountain. Most of the ore is transported from the mountains, while the refining workshop is under the mountain. The villagers of the hard stone village lived under the mountain. They built the houses with stones and mud, and they were tightly tied together. The gap between the houses is only enough for one person to walk through, and the horses are not crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole village is dead. There is no light and no sound. The guards arranged by the gram do not need wind lamps or torches. After all, the eyes of the Orcs have already adapted to the darkness. The guards on the mountainside saw a fire dragon running down the ore boulevard and then rang the bronze medal. The humming sound only lasted for a few seconds. But the people in the stone village all woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tears of the wilderness, if the alarm bell of the enemy strikes does not wake up within half a minute, then it is not far from death. The residents of the mine still retain this vigilance. The survivors who survived from the bad battlefields are more suitable for this environment than the leisurely nobles and knights in the south. This is also the confidence of the villagers to lead their villagers to guard the mine alone. the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco once said. Hard Rock Village is a village that is good at hiding. It is difficult to find them when the enemy comes. Perhaps this hiding ability will be greatly reduced in the face of the wolf's sensitive sense of smell, but for the southern aristocracy has never seen it, it can also play all the functions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tunnels, dark alleys, and blindfolds, the entire village suddenly became a dead-controlled territory. The truck dumped at the entrance of the village scattered some sausages that had not been transported into the storage room. A few domestic dogs are fighting for each other's unexpected food, and even the cavalry led by William is not far from calling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In William’s eyes, the village is covered with a strange atmosphere. It seems that there is a looming mist flowing from the open windows and doors, slowly covering the empty ones. street. In addition to sporadic sounds of barking and pigs. There is only the friction of the wind that blows the door panel. Occasionally, a window slammed into the window frame, but only a few dogs that had eaten at the intersection looked up and continued to tear the fat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the village, the gold mine on the mountainside is also silent, it seems that no one is on duty in this area. William felt that things were not good, and every one of his hair was warning him to leave as soon as possible. But his men are more concerned about another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they already carrying the gold in the alchemy workshop?" said a knight. "Let's run away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, go to the workshop to see. William waved his hand and led the cavalry to break the dog, rushing through the village and rushing to the workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemy equipment left by the dwarf is neatly arranged, and there are also thirty gold bars next to it. Each one has a palm length and two fingers wide. They pressed a piece of paper with a scribbled handwriting saying, "Do not mess, it will be dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William was really scared for the first time Lived, his lips trembled. I did not say the word "move". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Uther?" His men reminded him: "What do we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this time they understand that the situation is wrong. But seeing the gold in front of you does not take away, no matter the final victory or defeat will become the object of being laughed at. So William said with a hard scalp: "According to the original plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the phantom 驹 and also came to the periphery of the village, but his elemental runes The escort did not reach the same speed of movement, so it was still far behind, and continued to use the fist hammer to hit the horse pit and cut off the enemy's retreat. The Raven Baron went in another direction, and he needed to guard against the villages where other troops attacked Heim. The mage carefully avoided the sight of the outer cavalry and observed the situation of the new stone village. He is waiting for the offensive command issued by Mike. It is said that the order will never be missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of snoring, the cage going to the mine is slowly rising. The cage can transport fifteen people at a time, but for a heavily armed heavy knight, only ten can be shipped. So more than a dozen people are climbing up the steep mountain roads. The weight of the whole body makes them quickly consume a lot of physical strength, and everyone is sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc sneaked to the side of the cliff, using a crowbar to pull the last fixed nail. The cage first shook and then slammed down. The wooden cages shattered on the cliffs, and the heavily armed knights reflected the silvery white glow in the moonlight, accompanied by the sorghum "ah~~~~", which fell like a egg on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the signal of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolling cylinder was thrown down the wooden ladder, which contained a lot of scattered stones. The knight on the ladder quickly lowered his body and raised the shield to form a slope to the outside, allowing the barrel to slide down the cliff. When they exposed their eyes from behind the shield, the half-orc with the axe had rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a narrow space, the pace of flashing and moving is simply not useful, only the direct confrontation of muscles and muscles, fighting spirit and fighting spirit. Even Siegel, in this environment, can't think of other ideas besides a knife and a sword. The half-orcs occupy the topographical advantage and they attack from the top down. Only two or three people can keep the front line stable, and two or three people throwing stones down the cliff can pose a great threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the huge fall of the cage was transmitted to the village, the Orc residents began their counterattacks. They sneaked out of the tunnel and the dark alley, and attacked with a javelin or a simple sling. Although the knights are wearing strong armor, their mounts are not as good. The sudden attack made these knights into a moment of chaos, and several people were still under the back of the injured horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Counterattack!Collection! Counter!" William yelled and picked up the horn of his waist and blew it up. One long, one short, this is the command of the collection. The soldiers who could control the mount immediately moved to the alchemy workshop, and the infantry who had fallen off the horse staggered and took their legs to try to gather. However, Zucker would not let them go easily. The Orcs took the lead and rushed up, struggling with a sharp-edged sword and killing many soldiers with the villagers around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also entered the village at this time, and summoned the flame wolf dog to assist his attack. He was well prepared to cast a spell of protection arrows and swords. At the same time, the illusion of a circle surrounds Siegel, and those who try to target him will be unable to tell which one is the real goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scattered sporadic enemies in the village are not his goal, and it is enough to give them to the gram. He had long anticipated William's actions, knowing that it is now a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: all the cavalry are concentrated next to the alchemy workshop, and they will have a great chance to attack before they gather and start moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to kill nearly 100 soldiers with the half-orcs in the hard rock village, and be prepared to face huge sacrifices. However, Siegel, who sails all the year round, knows that the most dangerous part of the wave is the part of the wave. As long as it can eliminate the wave, all that remains is the ups and downs. He followed the horn of the William Knight and saw a large group of people concentrated in the open space in front of the alchemy workshop. On the back of them is the pile of waste slag, and on the other side is a strong chimney, they have no way to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
