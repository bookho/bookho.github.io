			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duel was not held immediately, and the two sides agreed to take it in the afternoon when the sun fell halfway. Each side can bring an accompanying person, responsible for carrying things and other miscellaneous matters; neither side can smash the other's body, this is a decent battle, not a barbarian fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but neither of the parties has put "decent" in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours before the start of the battle, neither side will attack at this time, but Siegel still ordered some people to pay attention. Then he walked down the wall and went to Janet's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a scent of scent that helps to ease tension. When the doors and windows are closed, the runes left by the dwarf on the outer wall can effectively block the noise, so the room looks calm and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn yawned, lying on the soft couch, his head a little bit. Siegel masters the core of the elemental rune matrix, and all the collected energy is made into elemental warriors, so the dragon girl has returned to a state of not eating enough. In addition, she has been worried about Janet, afraid of the magical little baby in her belly, the energy is highly concentrated, so she always feels sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel bypassed the Capricorn and tried not to wake her up. Because she did not feel threatened, the dragon girl rolled over and slept completely. On the big bed in the bedroom, Janet slept with a scent, and the corner of her mouth curled up in a tiny arc, apparently doing a comfortable dream. Siegel gently stroked her hair and carefully reminded Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mother of the earth bless, I can finally see you." Janet wrapped her arms around Siegel's neck and buried her head in the mage. Chest. The weird smell of plant fragrance and sulphur drifted into the nose, and Janet knew it was a unique taste of the cast material. She can filter out the smell of Siegel from the cover of this taste. Deeply buried in the taste of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. The spell has gone wrong, throwing me into the void world, and finally it’s safe to come back and let you suffer.” Siegel said: "Since I am back, you will be safe to raise your body, let your child be born, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny features nodded and tried to kiss West Geer. It took a long time to let go. "Everything is careful, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage nodded and arranged the pillow for his wife and covered the quilt. Then he turned and left, and there was still a battle to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this duel, most people don’t understand why they want to leave the city wall and the enemy one-on-one. Even for the so-called nobles and knights, it is not worth the risk. But the answer is simple. This is the battle between the Master and the Master. Siegel has discovered the opposite caster. Only the Knox Association will come to him on the New World. They are proficient in spiritual control spells, if they deliberately create damage. It will involve a large number of ordinary people, and the confusion and deaths caused by it will be difficult to control. Siegel is very worried about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Felton is also worried about Siegel’s means. From the current point of view, the Master of the Master is proficient in elemental spells, which is simply incapable of resisting the army without the protection of the walls and castles. As long as the wall can be dragged, what the spell can do is hard for ordinary people to imagine. Masters are always better at attacking, and the coalition forces in the south can be protected without walls. Felton did not want to be a sentry tower to detect magic and a shield against spell sneak attacks, resulting in only being trapped in the camp every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox will weaken the power of the southern lords, confuse them and kill each other. Only in this way can we quickly select the strongest from the scattered lords to control and concentrate the population of the South to serve the Knox Commonwealth. If it becomes the offensive and defensive between two mages every day, how can we dispatch ordinary soldiers, it is better to solve them as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two mages have the ability to control the situation, but Felton does not want to expose the identity of his own spellcaster, so he has always appeared as a warrior. This identity is very useful to him and cannot be abandoned at the moment. He called Serra and let her cover the battlefield when they were dueling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will use the thick fog to block the advances of the Southerners, and give it to me. But is there a need for a duel?" Serra didn't quite understand: "You two are all masters, but you are fighting with the rules between the duo knights. Why do you want to get involved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His choice is wise, very decisive I seized the only chance to force me to play." Felton sorted out his armor and said to Serra: "It’s a student of Dr. Faranis? Master, the intuition on the battlefield and the grasp of the situation. Above me. If I don't want to solve him at this time, I have an ominous premonition - I am afraid there will be no chance in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting through the Ore Avenue is your mission, not mine." Felton snorted and said, "A young mage, is there a better prey than this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serra suddenly thought of the anecdote that was circulating inside the synagogue. Caspar Da? The apprentice of the Master is a geek who is proficient in changing spells. He has been transformed back and forth among various monster forms and has gradually lost. The heart. He began to think that he was a predator, and the meaning of life is to constantly improve his position in the food chain. He always likes to look for opponents and evolve himself with the death of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You crazy, change" state," Serra's words are actually praise in Felton's ear, but the female mage said something: "Use Dense fog, I can only cover the battlefield for a while, you have to make a quick fix, otherwise they will definitely go forward to see, then you will be exposed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No It will take too long." A layer of fine scales climbed Felton's skin and formed a new shield under the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue for the duel is in the middle of the battlefield. The southern lord coalition forces sent soldiers to clean the battlefield and clear out an open space. The attendants of both sides checked the surrounding terrain in case the other party did not speak honors, set traps or ambush. Everyone must retreat to 500 meters, leaving enough buffer distance for both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Felton respectively arrived on horseback and then threw the reins to the accompanying personnel. The two met for the first time and looked at each other. Felton tried to read his mind from Siegel's expression. But I felt like I was hitting a cold wall. The young wizard is very calm and serious. Good control of body language. Just like a Knox Synagogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moore, taking the horse away, you don't need to be here." Siegel looked away from Felton's face. Then he said: "If I want to go back, I only need one thought, I can't use a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded and took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiles at Felton. He is wearing a chain armor and is protected by an iron plate on his chest. There is a pattern of nine-claw squid on it. It was just a temporary armor, and Siegel reached out to unfasten the buckle on his shoulder, let the armor fall to the ground, and then kicked him aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underside of the armor is naturally the robe of the Masters' Union, with a spoiled bag of materials, a few bottles of potions, and some reels. Siegel's wand is fixed on the wrist by the chain and will not be lost due to fierce battle. The dust of the star hangs quietly on the waist side, and the sharp front hand protects the hand with a faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your men are watching you, don't let them down." Siegel said: "I saw a lot of flags, there are Nord House, Ritter, Norre, and even some of the Katak family. Don't you know that their family's nickname is a stupid goose? Maybe they are excited to wait for the start of the battle. But don't know what they actually can't see. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that I want to cover the battlefield, Felton thinks. He deliberately forced me to do the same thing with the action of taking off the armor. It was really delicate. But does he know that without the restraint of armor, is it more powerful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Theo, come over, untie my breastplate, this is a fair battle, I am a person with honor." Then he Also send your own entourage far away, so you don't have to bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel. Squid." Felton said: "Look at the members of the Masters Federation, remove the walls and fortress, leave here Otherwise, your life is hard to protect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say stupid things." Siegel replied: "My wall is used against grievances, but Human weapons are hard to work. As long as I am there, you can't win. As a mage, you should have enough intelligence to see this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Victory? Do you think that all I need is victory?” Felton snorted and slowly pulled out his sword and squatted in front of him: “I just need to fight and destroy you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and took out the dust of the stars. He gently moved his wrist and danced the long sword to make a "squeaky" sound. "Your armor looks really good, it should fit well and it will be a good trophy. It is ironic that we have two wizards to fight with a long sword."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter? You will see even more amazing things in a while." Felton snorted and slammed his sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
