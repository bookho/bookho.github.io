			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel watched the green dragon disappear a little bit in front of him, and all his spells did not play any preventive role. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM Even if he uses the greatest power to twist the time, he can only slow down the speed of the break, and can't change the result. Green Dragon Alenoz Igus - the full name does not know - eventually disappeared between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a map on his skull that indicates the location of his master. Just in the easternmost part of the Old World, it is called "Rising Town". There are a few spells next to the map that can help position more precise locations. In addition, the green dragon stayed in the world only the space bag hidden in his heart. Since this is not part of the Green Dragon body, it survives the power of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four reels in the space bag. The scrolls used to write the scrolls are all in the ancient language, which requires careful study and translation. The scrolls contain tremendous power, but they can only be felt by hand. Siegel mourned the green dragon next to the stone boat and then collected the scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead." William walked over and said, "Why can't even have a body left? What kind of spell can do this?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of things." Siegel said: "Elemental tides, big cracks, and my elemental aggregates. I ask you for one thing, for Green Dragon. The death was kept secret, and he said that after he had said something to me, he left the sea and left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no problem. I don't see the golden dragon. Concerned about the disappearance of his companions, the dwarves will not ask, so how do you say, I will say." William asked Siegel: "You used to know this dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we have fought side by side." Siegel closed his eyes, controlled his emotions, and prevented tears from flowing out. "It left me something, I went back to the room. The tuna was handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I like to eat, but I won't cook!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can eat anyway, change your body." Siegel doesn't want to say more, swings his hand. Leaving the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voyage of the stone boat is still going on. I thought it was difficult for the elf to wait. After Jinlong stayed, the short talents understood what was really hard to serve. The forest of pointed ears is also known to be self-sufficient. If you don't care about him, he will not ask for anything. Jinlong constantly complains about the food of the dwarf, either not eating enough or eating badly. Wait until the end of the stomach. He would also suspect that the sleeping room was small and could not fully stretch his wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not easy to leave such a large room in the cabin so that you can show your true body. Please understand." Dwarf King is no good. The solution, but he can’t say it himself, but let the loyal guards say it. This brave dwarf was not hurt - the dragon appreciated his courage and loyalty. Let him leave in good condition - the three-story cabin of the non-sinking stone boat was collapsed by the tail of the dragon on the same day, two warehouses and a kitchen were smashed, and more than 20 dwarves were injured in this "accident" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves continued to "eat the leaves" in their rooms, and Siegel and William also quietly "study spells." The dwarf finally understood that his own strength alone was not enough to form a constraint and balance. He could not drive away the dragons who participated in the meeting. As we all know, the dragon and the mage formed an agreement, which is the only time the dragon compromised other races. After paying a price, William decided to come forward to communicate with Jinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your vibration has affected the ship, and now there are two divisions on the ship. Such behavior threatens the safety of the Master. If this reason If you feel that you are far-fetched, then your actions really affect the teacher's spell test. This is also a kind of violation." William is unceremonious and sternly denounces the Golden Dragon: "The meeting of the Dwarf King is very important for all races, for the Master. The same is true for the Federation and the Masters Association. We ask you to stop the destruction!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Dragon actually agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't believe that things will be that simple. Calling the dragon "you, you" will only make things worse and never ease. Especially after listening to the scene of the entire event of the dwarf retelling, Siegel had reason to believe that William played some means in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deformation Master is also outspoken: "The dwarf has imprisoned me for a long time, I just used this method to recover the loss. Jinlong is also bored, so I played this play with him. He took a big part of the benefits, you don't want to divide it too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back to your room. Siegel decided to study the scrolls in his hands until the arrival of the participants of the Starry Kingdom - that is Evan or Aaron. As for other people, he neither knows nor cares. For example, the Naga family on the waters of the ship a few days ago, even if Siegel lived at sea for so long, and never seen this ethnic activity, why did the dwarves invite such secluded creatures? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scrolls left by Green Dragon Alenoz Iggs are all bound to the dragon curse. In addition to detecting the dragons, there are orders for dragons, The invisible and most important spell of the dragon: the dragon swears. This spell is the master's strategic deterrent to the dragon. It is the force guarantee for the signing of the agreement between the two. It stands to reason that this spell is strictly forbidden to be recorded on the scroll, and it is absolutely not allowed to pass it. But what about this scroll? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the relationship between the Green Dragon and his master, Siegel can only make certain guesses: the master of the ten-faced scorpion is mastering the dragon curse, but not The only person in the control of the Masters Association. The magic of this world originated from the dragon, and only by studying the dragon can we fundamentally understand the magic and find the secret of the power of knowledge and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this speculation is based on a simple fact: the holder of the scorpion and the god of magic are opposites. But is this really a fact and is it just a theory? Siegel decided to see the Lear and the ten-faced nephew holders before making judgments. After studying the Dragon Curse, he began to control the facial muscles in the mirror. If he met Lear, he would cover his emotions and better find the truth from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a month of sailing on the sea, the participants continued to come by various means of transportation, and the dwarf's unsinkable boat became lively. The addition of halflings and gnomes filled the place with laughter and laughter. Although they did not establish a kingdom, the cultural practices passed down through the bloodline still made them very united. Contrary to this is the Centaur tribe, who lives at the foot of the mountains in the northern part of the Old World and provides the best horses for the starry kingdom. Although they have established a country, the militant nature has made their internal struggles very powerful. In order to select representatives to participate in the Dwarf Conference, more than 300 candidates were naturally eliminated - naturally, they will be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, a golden ship with a star-studded flag came from the east and blew the horn far away. There are more than 20 warships behind him, and none of them are less than five. They were fully armed, with guns, trebuchets and elite longbows neatly arranged on either side of the ship's side, looking at the ever-increasing stone boat with a firm look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The monarch of the starry kingdom, the guardian of humanity, Aaron Star I is ready to board the dwarf and not sink the stone boat!" A huge commander standing in the door Next to the bow, the power of magic was announced over and over again. Until the stern stone boat stopped, more than 20 cables were exchanged in the air, connecting the gold flagship of the starry kingdom and the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long ramp from the deck to the island with blue carpet. Four people carried the sedan chair and stepped over the carpet and walked over. Aaron's face was very pale, curled up in the blanket, and wiped away tears from time to time with a handkerchief. The sea breeze made his eyes sour and sour, the vibration caused his bones to be painful, and the seasickness almost killed him. But he insisted, and clenched his teeth to this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six loyal king guards who are disembarked behind him. They are the combination of the best warriors and the most keen assassins in the country. Protect the king's safety or execute any of his orders. In addition to the servants, there are six bodyguards, and only the King of Stars can do this. Other representatives can only come alone, even a powerful dragon is nothing more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King "Ice Boxing" Steen personally received Aaron and guided him to the already prepared king. Aaron was very grateful to the dwarf's enthusiasm and coughed and said: "I am very grateful to the dwarf for personal care. But my physical condition is very poor, I need the doctor to be around. I hope the dwarf can allow two more places." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stone nodded and agreed, so the scale of Aaron’s entourage expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king’s mission to the dwarf does not mean that the mission of the Royal Navy is over. The fleet has always been around the boat, and is always on alert. From the crystal glass window, Siegel can see Aaron’s starry flag flying on the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with Aaron, there are several representatives of the temple, the high-ranking priest of the morning temple, the main sacrifice of the Mother Earth Temple, and the temple of the gods of warriors. General coach. Then, two representatives from the Masters Association and the City of Learning also stepped down the ramp. They were the Necromancers Buhyan Charles and Lear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
