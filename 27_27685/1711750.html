			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel whispered, others listened carefully. The situation has become very unfavorable and some things have exceeded the dwarf's plan. Eilet analyzed that the enemy's caster, the Knox Commons Master, Siegel added, was already trying to hurt the guard stone, and it was obvious that the stone did not counterattack now. Whether these stone statues are strong enough, they will inevitably reveal the weakest state tonight. On the moonless night, you will lose your usual defensive ability. Those who cast the spell will definitely find this and grab the cave, so the original smuggling plan can only make changes. The harassment operation has changed from seeing the situation to being carried out, and the task of entering the cave of Longshiya can only be handed over to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only you can see those rays, kid." The dwarf said: "But we also welcome you to stay with us, let us do a good vote. "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Elinette, I know that the safest position in the world is behind the dwarf." Siegel smiled and replied: Of course, I have to be surrounded by elves and plateaus. But I have to go to the cave to see, as you said, only I can go up, isn't it? I like the feeling of being needed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad boy, be careful, wait for you to come back and tell us a joke!" Dio patted Siegel's face, scraped his nose, and said : "The gods will bless you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also the moon god," said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you are not a dwarf, so it is estimated...I wish you good luck anyway, kid." Dwarf Elinte said: "Remember, after you go in, Keep going to the left, the more scorch on the wall, the safer it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gives everyone peace of mind and then starts climbing the wall. This time he brought weapons, but only limited to scimitars, warhammers, flying axes and long whip. There is also a small bag hanging behind his waist, inside which is a water bladder, a bottle of therapeutic agents and a light stick, not many but also a necessity. He left other things under the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gimmicks are constantly attacking, and Siegel carefully avoids them. He jumped from a mountain road to another mountain road, and his healthy posture was like an elf. Hiding on the road that leads to Longshi Cliff, Siegel makes a “good situation” gesture under the mountain to reassure his companions. At this time, the light of the sun has completely disappeared into the sky, and the stars began to emerge gradually, with a faint brilliance. The foot of the mountain has become dark, so Siegel can't see his partner, but he believes his partner will definitely see his gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonless night begins, which means that Siegel can only rely on himself from now on. Not far from the steps, there are stains everywhere, and those are the Knox Commonwealth hired mercenaries. They attacked and guarded the stone statue, then were killed on the platform, the body was thrown down, and now the damage caused by the collision to the steps can be clearly seen. A few silver coins scattered on the ground have been bent, and it is conceivable how powerful they are when they fall. Siegel tried to control himself not to imagine the scene at the time, took a few deep breaths, and then began to climb up with excitement and nervousness,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With bloody steps, Siegel deliberately slowed down. It can be said that he must look up once every step. In his fantasies, there will be a huge stone-like fist that rises out of the steps and then fights himself down. Such an imagination is so realistic that it is more stressful than a real threat. Fortunately, this is just an illusion. Siegel has climbed to the top of the cliff and has not seen any signs of stonework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the cliff is a flat, sturdy platform, about seven or eight meters wide, with four statues standing on either side of the platform, they look like a squat The trolls are dressed in thick and sturdy stone armor - this is the stone statue of the dwarf Elinte, a guardian who is tireless, not afraid of weapon damage, or even afraid of water and fire. The red spear shot from the bottom of the cliff, continuously hitting four statues, Siegel can clearly feel that the energy of magic continues to gather in the statue, the violent destructive power is constantly being compressed, maybe this is those The means by which the mage destroys the statue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these stone statue guards, behind them is an open bronze door. When Elinte came here last time, he knocked on the door shaft of the left door, so the half of the door was weakly shrouded on the ground. The back of the gate is completely dull and dark, but the dwarf said that the cave is very magical. When you walk in, the wall will glow, allowing you to see the road under your feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
