			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big and heavy thing of the sail is very conspicuous and difficult to miss, but there is not enough time to distinguish which square sail is a jib - So as long as it is a large enough cloth, it is enough to satisfy Siegel. The four strong half-orcs came to pick up the sails, and they were asked to place the sails in the unmanned place at the stern. Although I don't understand the meaning, the awe of the Master allows them to execute the order accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the sails, other materials, especially food and water, are needed to sail on the sea. The dock here is just a repair dock instead of an unloading dock. There aren't many of these things, but Siegel at the tip of the eye found an interesting phenomenon: the cargo ship whose tail was burned stopped next to the paddle boat, none of them above. But the draught is very deep. The mage immediately speculated that this might be a merchant ship that was robbed but had not had time to unload it. There should be something that everyone needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Siegel recites a spell and casts it through the sea. He chose to mix the power of water into the summoning giant squid spell, which is more powerful and more powerful, but the limbs are more fragile. Except for the Master's expectation, the summoned squid is much larger than expected, and the thickest place is almost the same as Siegel's waistline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a good thing, especially for destroying cargo ships and moving supplies. Under the command of Siegel, the giant squid slammed the hull with a pointed tip, then put the tentacle into it from the crack and tore it. The board was like a crispy biscuit under its strange force, and it was quickly pulled out of a big hole. The raven flew in from the hole to provide a vision for the Master. Most of the cargo compartments are cloth and even a few expensive silks. These goods can sell at a good price in the New World, but they are not what Sigel needs. The ten sacks of turnips and the dried apples are not what the orcs like, and the results are all cheaper. There are not many leftovers, and the hard-boiled cheese is so badly smeared by the orcs, but it can still be carried to the ship. It is a pity that the original rum and brown ale are not much left. These can be kept for a long time, which is enough to replace drinking water. But the orcs are greedy and drink, and they can thank Siegel for leaving it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge squid stunned the refugees who were on board, and they thought of the squid sign on the sip of Siegel, and immediately slammed down. "The Holy One of Poseidon," they call Siegel. If at other times, the giant squid can definitely scare a group of people, but now it gives them confidence. Some people spontaneously organized to help the squid carry the box, so that the overall progress is greatly accelerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked into the city and stared at the location of several shipyards. Unlike before, there is now a black smoke column that is thicker and deeper than the surrounding night. This should be the means of the alchemist Eric, using the inferno hypha. Among them, Siegel saw black figures in the smoke constantly appearing, seeming to have four arms and a long face like a beak. Because the distance is too far, more details can't be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the city, the two shipyards visited by Siegel have already ignited the fire, and the maddening fire wolf is stronger than expected. . If the mage's vision can penetrate the physical wall, you can see the stacked bodies, a thick flame python is greedily swallowing flesh and blood. Even the fire wolf became part of the body of this monster, and the metal liquid melted by the shipbuilding tools became the armor of the fire snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black ship approached the berth, it was the moment when the three-eyed warlord Ronte was the most angry. He blew the horn of the command, and a huge voice spread throughout the city. Subsequently, his elite guards leaped to the ground without waiting for the full landing, and quickly established the first position. A group of orcs and half-orcs controlled by the grievances rushed up, but they were not able to approach the distance that the sword could attack, and they were cut down by huge long hooks and trenches. ** Falling down like a harvested wheat, then the grievances are drilled out, and the claws are trying to pounce on the orcs. The curse can then be cast from the witchcraft appearing on the deck. A blood-red light curtain envelops all the orcs in the ship. The grievances try in vain and find that possession is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two giant stone throwers emerged from the cabin, four meters in height. They are deformed variants, the legs are short and thick, much shorter than the normal family, but the wingspan does not fall. The three-eyed warlords left the two giants in order to be used as mobile trebuchets. But now only they need to use the power of people to help clear the debris of the dock, so that the follow-up troops can land as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few horns sounded from within the city and seemed to echo the call of three eyes. Forces that do not respond will be hanged by the crime of deserters unless they die. Lund again blew the horn and issued orders for all troops to defend on the spot. If there are still orcs on the street at this time, they will all be destroyed as enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send ten elite soldiers to Haiyan Shipyard, kill all the slaves who escaped, and take back the enemy heads that I shot." Three eyes Longte said wickedly: "I want the witch sacrifice to curse his soul and let him die." It is also not peaceful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea salt shipyard has been loaded on the side of the ship, and Siegel is guiding them to untie the cable and take up the anchor. This is still the simplest job, but they still look clumsy. It’s not that the lack of strength is not enough to work, but that it is too hard to master the correct rhythm. The harder work is still behind: the ship has a rudder hidden under the deck that helps to control the direction when using the paddle. The protective arrows and mattresses were taken into account when designing, so the steering window was not opened to the helmsman, but there was a narrow window under the corner of the bow. So there must be one person to navigate and the other to steer. These two tasks are not simple, especially when they come up, they need to sail out of the port. As the chaos in the city continues to spread, it is likely that residents will hide from the sea. And Siegel is not familiar with the waterways here, and night flights are likely to be in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one choice for today's plan. Siegel found the rope and locked the rudder so that it remained in the middle forever. Then he went up the deck and unfolded the stern. This is a spinnaker of the bow, which is very well maintained, whether it is canvas or locks. Originally the ship was powered by a square sail on the main mast, which was used to improve maneuverability and auxiliary balance, but the ship's power and center of gravity were unbalanced with only the auxiliary stern and the ship was difficult to maneuver. For the first time, Siegel faced such a situation. He could only learn and adapt as soon as possible based on his own experience and ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind tonight is blowing from the land to the ocean, which is very beneficial to Siegel, but the direction of the tide is just the opposite. Siegel thought about the action posture of the black ship not long ago - at that time it put down the sails and only proceeded by inertia and tides - and then roughly estimated the speed of the water flow. It only takes a few more minutes, and the last resident can get on the boat, so Siegel sends a raven to inform Mana to let the female shooter come back as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pet faithfully executed this order and flew to the back of the port area. However, it found that the shooter was not alone, and the one-eyed veteran Fazak was also there. This loyal old spy has a feather arrow on his ankle. His blood flow is like a note, and his sole and calf are in two directions. He limped to Mana, who rushed up and helped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flee, child." Fitzk said: "Go to the boat and escape to the sea, so there is still a way to live."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not with the count, why are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes and alchemists They were disguised, and they tricked the count to the Beastmaster's Temple.” Fitzak tried to move the pace, and the blood flowing from his leg was drawn a long line behind him. "Don't ask the child more, knowing too much is not good for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female archer bit his lip, took a deep breath, and then used his own The shoulders pick up the old man's arm and help him share the weight as much as possible. "Don't say more, there is a ship in front, you go up with me, then go back to the south. We don't mix the things of the orcs here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set up Fazak in the direction of the paddle boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected pursuits arrived. It is neither an elite guardian of the three-eyed warlord nor an orc resident possessed by the grievances, but an inconspicuous dwarf in the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerber is his name, but in addition to his yelling at the time of the auction, he did not say a word at other times, silent like a dumb . He always followed the alchemist silently, helping him organize various experimental materials and alchemy vessels. It seems that even his dog never screams, quietly squatting, always looking like a dying man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the situation is quite different. The gnome is covered in blood, like pouring blood from the head to the feet, taking a shower. He holds the dagger in one hand and the head of a half-orc in the other. As he walked forward, he cut the skin on the half-orc's head with a dagger and threw it on the ground with a relaxed little tune in his nose. And his pet dog followed quietly, constantly lowering his head and picking up the fallen flesh, chewing and swallowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man, why do you have to drag down the lovely lady?" The gnome said: "If you are jealous and embarrassed, you don’t know anything, now I boarded the ship that left here and went high. But now I have to die here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak saw the gnome appear and his heart was cold. As an experienced spy, he always felt that the count, the alchemist and the gnome were not normal. He patiently observed that with the help of the grocery store, he finally discovered that both the alchemist and the gnome were fake, and always used the delicate human skin mask to cover up the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
