			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel carefully moved along the flow of the Black River, neither too far from the river nor close. He spends only six hours a day on the road, and the other time is either to avoid nearby orcs, or to find a safe place to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are to Macabu, the more you can feel the detection spells that hang over the sky, and they patrol uninterrupted every day, the necessary measures to prevent the mage . Among all the casters, the Master has the most abundant means, and each Master has a different personality. They will have different opinions on the same thing, and the action is “uncontrolled and unpredictable”. Some mages are good at flying, and the walls are jokes for them; some mages are good at deformation and stealth, and all rely on the human eye's defenses to be ineffective; some mages are good at explosions, railings and door locks are just paper-like in their eyes. Toys; the most terrible thing is cursing and toxins, so that the lords of all places sleep uneasy, and do not know what to eat. In order to avoid this situation, the human lord and the temple cooperate, convert to the faith, let the temple collect the eleventh tax on their own territory, in exchange for spell protection. The Starry Kingdom and the Chennai Church are such a mode of cooperation. The army is king, the King Guard is a temple, and the cooperation of the king and theocracy creates a powerful kingdom that lasts for a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other races also have the means to guard against the caster. The dwarves do not have a mage, but there are enemies who provide protective enchantment; the elves of the royal family must receive magical education from an early age. They are all powerful mages. For the orcs, they like the nature of killing and muscles before the brain, which makes it extremely difficult to have a calm and wise mage, but they turn to the witch offering, which is the "priest" of the orc race. They arrange exclusive enchantments in important areas, on the one hand to prevent the priests of other faiths from approaching, and on the other hand to detect the whereabouts of the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important of these is the detection of magic, which is also the most common spell in the various lord castles. Whether it's a magic item or a magic enchantment, it will be invisible under the influence of magic, including the magic wand will also be detected. Even if the anti-magic force field is used to suppress the effect of detecting magic, the alerter can still feel the blank space that suddenly appears in the detection area - that is, the area where the magic cannot penetrate, so that an alarm can be issued. Guard. Imagine in the alarm area, in order to avoid being discovered, a mage can't carry a wand, there is no magic item on it, and there are no protective spells. Even if the spell material package is not affected, but there is a threat from the flesh and blood. Can it be comparable to a professional assassin? The lords can finally sleep well and don't worry about being a mage one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord, the temple, and the wizard association formed a balance, at least not with large internal friction, and at the same time maintaining the stability of political power, theocracy, and legal power. The emergence of the New World is just right, so that these three forces have room for expansion, and this model has also been brought. The Cavaliers are easy to train, and the lord's army can be formed as long as there is a population, but the priest's production is to follow the gradual advancement of faith, which will be very slow. In the New World, the strength of the temple is relatively weak, so the Masters Association separated the Masters Association and closely integrated with Deepwater City, trying to get out of a new mode of cooperation, but other places are still old. The orcs did not have any motivation to innovate. To a certain extent, they were more "traditional", so the witchcraft around Makarbu was enchanted one layer after another and did not stop for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer enchantment is only to monitor the main roads, using the skull towers set in the middle of the road and in the middle of the Blackwater River - the guard towers stacked with enemy skulls - As the core of enchantment, release detection magic and detect divine power. Siegel did not take these roads, and avoided being too close to the river bank. It is easy to avoid these detections. Continuing to move closer to Macabu, the number of enchantments began to increase, and skull towers were also established in parts of the woods and mountain passes. Siegel can only choose to keep on detouring, so that the straight line distance that advances every day is drastically reduced. Coupled with the need to avoid the constantly moving patrols, beware of the dark whistle hidden in the hidden place, Siegel walks 60 miles a day, but at most 10 kilometers to Macabu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at this speed, there is no way to keep it, and the enchantment in front is already very solid, leaving no gaps. Siegel had to stop on a small hill, not far from the last big waterfall of the Black River, and then the height of the forward terrain quickly decreased, continuing to the beach. Macabu is just a hundred miles away, at the end of Siegel’s vision. There are already a lot of houses and stars. The smoke rises and makes the scene of the sea distorted and blurred; the most concentrated places of the lights, you can see several large ships under construction, many small black spots like mosquitoes are busy on the keel, their work keeps going through the night. . There are several such shipyards, distributed on the north and south sides of the Heishui River, and there is a large maintenance shipyard by the sea. If you don't know it beforehand, you can't see that this is an orc city. You think it is a hot metal port of the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
