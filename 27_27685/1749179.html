			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Forest is in sight, and Siegel has seen the flagpole of the Southern Sentry. Two teams of businessmen have gathered here, and more than 20 carriages are lined up. They brought crystal vessels and troubadours from the sea and wanted to "sell" these two things to the elves. The elves' wines are the goods they want, and they can be sold at a good price in the hands of any human aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is here, you donâ€™t need the Raven Baron, and Siegel lets it fly with two letters to the west. One of them, Irene, who wrote to Mora's, detailed his own observations and reminded the dwarfs of the Knox Association. At the same time, he used the entire Zeeshan Gold Mine as a collateral to borrow money from Mora and build his own Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Siegel planned to start building the magic tower five years later, the scale is not too big, mainly for magic learning. After the wizard's magic test site moved to Heim's collar, Siegel felt that he could even save the cost. But the situation is compelling, unless he wants to leave everything he guards and leave the New World, otherwise there must be a magic tower to resist the dangers that will be faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another letter was written to Janet, letting her and the principal officials of the Territory work together to plan the city defense system with the magic tower as the core, and receive the materials and Prepare for construction. At the same time, in order to continue to maintain the territorial economy without collapsing, Siegel asked them to find a way to land the land about 30 miles south of the striped mountain into the Heim collar, and the work of mining could not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the future will call Heim the "miner's collar", but this is better than no future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing this, Siegel concentrated on preparing for the Elven Forest. If you can get help from the elves, at least let Knox's pace slow down and leave more time for Siegel. But the Elven Kingdom here is a rather isolated system, except for sending soldiers in the battle against the orcs, and at other times it is not how to contact the outside world. Siegel did not have much hope for his trip, and he could only listen to his fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern Sentry of the Elven Forest has no guards, and there are no obstacles to the roads leading to the forest. However, neither of the two caravans went forward, and they stayed in the open space in front of the sentry, killing time with playing cards and gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who break into the forest will die, this is an iron law. It is different from the elves in the east of the sea. The wood elves of the New World are harder and more proud, and the foreigners are more vigilant. They guarded the forest in strict order and set strict laws in order to prevent outsiders from being jealous. However, according to Master Lia, the interior of the elf is still very harmonious and free. All the harsh parts are just for the elves to survive on this dangerous continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Master, the people in the caravan are obviously nervous. They kept down the noisy voice and no longer spoke vulgar language. Siegel knows that if they go forward, I am afraid they will be more at a loss. So he quietly walked to the front of the team, waiting for the elf to appear in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From noon to dusk, until the cool breeze blowing through the night, and finally a few elves came out to meet them. The long life span gives the elves more patience than other races, they have enough time to squander and never care about the fast pace of life in other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to enter the Elf Forest. Wait a moment." The elves belonging to the side patrol are wearing dark grey clothes, and if they don't move quickly, these Clothes can make them invisible in the forest. As it was about to enter the night, one of the elves held a light oil lamp that emitted silver. He followed the faces of the human beings in order to see if they had a bad relationship. Then he dimmed the oil lamp and hung it on the lock of the gray belt next to the crotch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome!" The genius of the elf is also mixed with the accent of the Elvish, beautiful and rhythmic. He said it was very slow, so that everyone could clearly hear: "My name is Lumir, a captain of the Elven Forest side patrol team. I will lead you into the forest until you reach the rest arranged for you. Don't leave this road, don't act in private, don't shout loudly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he turned and took the lead in the forest. Others hide behind the trees, leaving only the shadows that are indistinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering giant woods in the night look very serene, and everyone can hear the rustling of the endless leaves in the forest. The outer trees are like the high walls listed, dividing the forest inside and outside into two worlds. Under the faint starlight, the outermost tree is gray in outline, like a rune-reinforced masonry. The inner leaves are slightly glowing with silver. Whether it is its own light or the reflection of the moon and the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the equipment used by the Elf can also gain strength from these plants. Weapons can increase damage and armor is better able to resist damage. It is precisely because of this kind of reinforcement that the elf's weapons and armor can be more artistic, light and colorful, not as clumsy as humans and dwarves. Leah's longbow is in the Elven Forest, capable of launching Frostbolt. Once you leave here, it is just a delicate long bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are all kinds of magical effects, these trees are not magic towers after all. They provide magical power, but they don't have enough defense. Their essence is still plants, even if they are stronger than ordinary plants, they cannot resist the damage of elements like bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to flames, acids, and ice, the plague and some pests against plants can damage the protection of the Elven Forest. The Elf Cruises will make a quick and violent counterattack, facing the Knox Synagogues who are prepared early? Siegel does not think that the elves can get the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked more than ten miles until they reached a creek late at night. The stream flows down the verdant hillside covered with forest trees, and the stream reflects the little moonlight that shines through the gaps in the leaves. There is an open space next to the stream, surrounded by shrubs of strawberries and roses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumir said: "Tonight, you are resting here, don't leave the scope of the shrub. You will continue on the road at dawn tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he put down the oil lamp on his waist and walked into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wanted to talk to him a few words, but Lumir simply ignored it. He uses psionic vision to see the hidden elf guards around him, and greeting them may cause unnecessary trouble. The helpless Master can only continue to wait, hoping to get help in the town of the Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf only needs four hours of meditation rest every day to be enough for physical recovery, so outside humans only have four hours at this rest, which is only enough Everyone simply hits a donkey. Fortunately, there are no beasts and robbers here. Experienced businessmen and clothes are lying down, so that they can recover their strength as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no Ravens helping the night, Siegel used the Rune Element Guard. The earth element appeared in front of the mage with the sound of booming and banging, covering the sight of others with his own body. The caravan's guards looked at the wizard's monsters very nervously, and they all tightened their nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves will guarantee that they will not be attacked by wild beasts in the forest, but generally they will not prevent human beings from contradicting each other. They are on this matter. I have suffered too much. There have been several times when the merchants of the shackles pretended to fight each other, led the elves to persuade them, and counted several deaths and injuries on the head of the elves in the chaos, and then claimed them. The first few elves also resisted the temper to explain this matter, and then they finally understood the original, and then adopted a policy regardless of whether they asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these people's blood flow out of the shrub range and need to be cleaned up, the elves don't care about their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegelâ€™s elemental guards shocked the caravans and surprised the elves. Although not every elf's physical condition can become a mage, they have been magically learning for a long life, knowing the limits of the elemental summoning spell. They were very strange at first, the choice of the human mage, because they wanted to extend the time of summoning spells, they must constantly provide magical focus, and they can't rest. You can see the Master sleeping peacefully, and the earth elements are still safely guarded. Ten minutes passed, half an hour passed, and after four hours, Elemental Warrior was still dedicated to guarding his master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf understands what this means and immediately reports it. The leaves gave the leaves and branches to the branches, accompanied by the sound of the rustling of the Elf forest, and the news quickly spread to the "Art Institute." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel returns the power of the earth element to the earth, and puts the core of the instrument back into the space bag. He took out the feed and fed it to his mount, and turned his mind. This kind of self should be able to arouse the interest of the elves. If there is a wizard of the elves to ask, then Siegel can give his information to him. There are very few elves who care about the outside world, but those who can come to him must be more extroverted. Although exposing your own elemental rune guards is a big risk, the risk is worthwhile in order to deal with the threat of the Knox Association as early as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravans know that time is up, and the elves won't wait, so get up early and pack up. They cleaned the rest area without leaving a bit of rubbish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
