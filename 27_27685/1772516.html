			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s roar is heard by everyone, and no one has ever dared to speak like this in front of Kerry. There was an angry scream around, asking the great King of Khan to teach this knight from the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him!" someone shouted. Then it became a sound and uniform voice, constantly echoing on the holy mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With excitement Compared with Guanzhong, the giant who was completely dominated by blood power did not react. He still stood there quietly without saying a word. Kerry is taking the time to adjust the muscle state of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was originally a very fit person, the best time is like a muscle mountain that can walk. Just becoming a leader, staying away from fighting and hunting, is blessed than before, but still a rare brawny. But the current state is even more amazing: just in full view, the fat on his body is quickly consumed, and the lines that belong to the muscles have never been so clear. One piece after another, his muscles tremble in turn, just like some kind of machinery is running tests step by step, adjusted to the best state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s heart was tight and his dangerous instincts made him fall back immediately. In the battle, he has always obeyed his instincts, because Sir Bill told him that the body reacted faster than the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, Kerry just shook a little, and the next moment he rushed to his face, and the spear also stepped into the place where he had just stood. If you don't retreat in advance, you have been punctured on the artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no time to rejoice in his death, and Siegel immediately waved his weapon to counterattack. After the speed of the Kerry, the simple dodge is to find death, the only vitality is to entangle. Of course, it must not be the entanglement of the body and the limbs, so the power of the giant will soon kill Siegel. The so-called entanglement is to constantly change the center of gravity of the other party's weapons, and use the sticky and connected methods to resolve the strength and speed of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer the martial arts of the elves, but the combat skills of the dwarves. The elf pays attention to the detachment, the elegant and quick play. The dwarves are in groups, forming a row of fronts. On the front line, the body is behind the companions. So even if you face a strong enemy, you can't go back. All the effort is on the lever formed by the feet, waist and arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s support, seemingly restrained Kerry’s martial arts, but he knew the shortcomings of this tactic. Adhesive techniques can entangle strong enemies. But it can't last long, and it's hard to fight back alone. Dwarves need to rely on their peers to get rid of such a stalemate, or they will soon get tired and reveal flaws. Where are the companions in the one-on-one duel? So we must look for opportunities and solve everything, Siegel tells herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking later. Two people stood apart from each other, and once again, they have re-established a stalemate, and a series of changes have seen people dazzled. Some people are surprised, some are happy, and some are full of worry. The Mesera is holding the child tightly. If it is not the temperature of the cockroach, she may have passed out. After the contest, Kerry became King of Khan, just like being a person, very powerful. The idea of ​​attacking the elves was forcibly pushed, and many tribes were not afraid of things going on, and they were eager to cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also tried to persuade. But Kerry insisted on his own opinion. In the tribe, although you can make a speech as a wife, but more importantly obey, especially the thing of riding a horse, it is a man's business. Seeing Kerry's eyebrows wrinkled, and he was about to reach the edge of anger, Mesera did not dare to say anything more. He could only secretly do combat reconnaissance and reduce the risk of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vaguely felt that things were wrong, but did not understand the operation of magic. There is no way to solve it. Seeing that Siegel and Kerry were in a group, she didn't know what kind of attitude she should face. She could only pray in her heart that she would finally be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s tactics played a very good role in the field. Kerry also responded. He no longer uses the ice gun as the main weapon, and his hands are held in a single hand. With his power, one hand does not affect the threat of weapons, but one hand can be vacated. The long guns are still involved with the long sword, while the giant's iron fists continue to wave to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the king of the prairie!" The giant shouted at Siegel: "I am the king! I am the king! I am the king!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say three times." Siegel twisted his body and broke free from the giant palm. But his sleeve was pulled down. One arm**. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the distance, Kerry plans to take Siegel to fix the flexible warrior, and then use a long gun to wear him through the heart. Siegel can't directly compare strength with him. If he uses a long sword to threaten the giant's hand, then he has nothing to block the ice rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he still has weapons. Siegel suddenly thought of this, and the momentary loss made him pay the price of another sleeve. More and more wounds are caused by the wading daggers that are constantly flying. Blood ran down his forehead, neck, arms, chest and thighs and splashed at his feet. Blood and snow are frozen together and polished into smooth red ice by boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant shrank backwards and then gained speed like a tight bowstring, swooping over. The rifle of the long gun arrived at the earliest, and was swayed by Siegel with a long sword, but the giant palm took the power of the ice and grabbed the neck of Siegel. The mage's body is out of balance, and he has no time to dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not impossible to counterattack. Siegel’s effort to lift his legs took out the obsidian dagger from the boot and blocked it in front of the giant palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp dagger can leave a mark on the fine gold, and the blood power from the Frost Giant is never known for its skin toughness. The dagger penetrates the palm of your hand and passes straight through, revealing a black fang from the back of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it would let the giants close their hands. I didn’t expect him to even scream, and the pain with the dagger still caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel tried to retreat, but the ice under his feet made him half-step and failed to completely withdraw from the threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle of the obsidian dagger concentrates on his nose bone, and he clearly hears the sound of the fracture. Aching is nothing at this time, and the blurring of the eyes is the most terrible. The normal line of sight was smashed by tears and blood. He had to open his mind and at least see the outline of his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the king of the grassland!" Kerry screamed, pulling out the dagger in the palm and throwing it at Siegel. The obsidian dagger is only a vague shadow in the vision, and Siegel can only guess its general direction and then use the long sword to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant took this opportunity to sweep with a long gun, just hit Siegel’s armpit. This is a place that is not easy to bear, and Siegel shakes a few times. Falling on the back and falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana couldn’t help but exclaimed, shouting out loudly: "Come up, get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s current posture is very unfavorable, and his legs are sour. There is almost no consciousness under the knee. Giant Kerry will not let this opportunity pass, use the rifle as a stick, keep squatting down, and block possible escape directions. He screamed and shouted: "I am the king! I am the king of the grassland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although with a long sword. But the huge force still hits Siegel. This time, there is no way to dismount it, and it can only rely on the body. Siegel only felt that the ice beneath his body was shattered, melted, and mixed with the soil and then squeezed out. He is like being stuck in a pit, getting deeper and deeper, and the space for activities is getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun emerges from behind the clouds, just above their heads. Only the light column that was shot from the sky on the entire holy mountain was just draped over the shoulders of the giant Kerry, making him like a god. The dazzling light shone directly into Siegel's eyes, and Kerry became a shadow of darkness. No more details can be distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the king of the grassland!" He roared again. The Three Spirits have already lowered their spiritual blessings, and this beam of sunshine clearly shows their attitude: blessing the giant Kerry to help him defeat his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud pit below the body is already half a foot deep, just like a coffin. Siegel has felt that the earth is going to devour his own intentions, and he feels that the sky and freedom are farther and farther. He is screaming at the three spirits in his heart. What are the ignorant things that you want to let your people die? Without the source of faith, what else can the Three Spirits have? ! At this time, I also help the giant Kerry who has brains. What does it mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel couldn’t see the position of the pike, but he could see his approximate posture from Kerry’s figure. A sigh of relief came from the mind of the Master. He lifted his ankle to Kerry's knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent sudden attack wounded the joints of the giants, and the king of the prairie smashed down on one knee. He glared at the opponent who had fallen into the mud pit and his body had been covered in red, determined to end this long-lasting duel. He has three spirits to protect. The situation is completely dominant, absolutely invincible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
