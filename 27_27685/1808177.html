			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even if the avatar has been sweating and exhausted, Siegel has not acted rashly. It’s easy to lie, it’s hard to lie to yourself. Siegel certainly knows his physical condition and knows that more than half an hour of spelling will make him tired, but he will not have the ability to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no one else is coming from this place, or Siegel will definitely be overwhelmed. The rainbow light wall isolated everything, and the power of the nuclear power was not enough to penetrate through the entrance of the steam. If you can get the support of the Peruvian nuclear, this battle has long since ended. Judging from the inability to use the four-pulse arrow, he should not be able to fully grasp the power of the elemental aggregate and the secret energy core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the situation is getting bigger and bigger, the enthusiasm for the attack, and the violent emotions make him make mistakes continuously. Siegel took the opportunity to remove the four layers of protection on his body, so the elemental spell could have hurt his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real four-pulse arrow fires a rainbow of light, constantly shooting at the avatar. Siegel launched a counterattack, but still kept a three-point effort to deal with possible emergencies. He already has an advantage in hand, which is like having four or five pieces on the board. Nowadays, I am more and more impatient. When I am forced to the limit, a person can often do very crazy things, let alone the purpose of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows his own elf pace habits, how to dodge, how to move has traces. He only needs to shoot at the position with the highest probability of occurrence, and he can always hit it once. The avatars tried to change their habits and avoid the four-pulse arrows, but the unfamiliar actions made his physical exertion more serious and more errors occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These errors are fatal, especially in the hands of knowing opponents. The avatar was eventually hit by the four-legged arrow and thighed in the explosion. The victory and defeat have been divided, and the last blow of the dying struggle has not been used. Siegel hastened to blow him into pieces with more four-pointed arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he only had time and "guts" to sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to use the mortal enemy mirror as a shield from the beginning has been successful, and Siegel has beaten himself by only half the power. "This fully shows the decisive role played by the hostages in the battle." Because it is fighting with his own body, Siegel will inevitably think of himself. If Lear holds Janet or Isaac as a shield. What will happen to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the level of familiarity, the mortal enemy mirror is better, but it is said that Lear can predict the future. It’s really going to fight, and it’s harder for Lear to deal with Siegel than to deal with Seger. Will it be Siegel’s corpse fragments when it’s time to go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never let Lear reach out to his loved ones, no one can do it! Siegel felt that he could no longer waste time, and the sense of urgency made him start on the road immediately. Of course, the good things of the mortal enemy mirror must not be wasted, and quickly put it in the space bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue forward. The roads become much smoother, but the surrounding elements are getting thinner and thinner. Soon, in addition to the elements that Siegel himself had, the surrounding area had become a dead magic zone, and he also changed back to its original form. This means that the wand has lost all its uses, and only the dust of the stars can protect Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is something other than rock and earth. Gemstones of various colors and varieties, large and small, are inserted into the earth like seedlings, and it is not feasible to shake or extract. These hard things make walking difficult, and the dead magic zone can't fly. Siegel uses the steps of the elves to reduce the persecution of the gemstone to the soles of the feet and pass through the area as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it is the destination of this trip. Thirty-six long stones taller than pine trees stand on the ground. Encircle a circle that resembles a cage, trapping an old man in the center. He was licking his thin body, only a dirty and broken gray cloth around his waist; the black muddy nails were constantly licking his white hair. Because it was not taken care of for a long time, the white hair fell to the chest and tangled into one dead button, no matter how hard he tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his hand outside Stonehenge and said hello to him. He has a weird feeling. He seems to be very familiar with the people behind the stone. When he comes up, he can't help himself and trust him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty faces, are you? I finally saw you. What is your name now?" The old man has muddy eyes and a wrinkled face. A pair of dry lips are etched by scratches caused by dry cracks. He rubbed his hands and looked at Siegel nervously. His tone was full of expectation: "How are you doing well? Ok?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. He has been out for a long time and has never returned. We can only rely on a telepathic dialogue, and we must be careful about the monitoring of the gods. I can't say much. Your appearance is what it describes to me." There was a trace of sadness in the middle, and there was endless resentment. "Oh, I haven't seen myself for a long time, and I forgot my courtesy. I'm called Turner. I haven't had a surname, but Turner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can you show me?” Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be very careful, not bad." Turner nodded and scratched his hair for a while, and he pulled out a ten-faced scorpion. The scorpion is made of a bone-like material that is already very abrasive and almost a sphere. However, the above figures are all shining, the light forms a substantial line, entangled and left the scope of Stonehenge, rising to the sky, until it disappeared at the end of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner’s fingers swayed and the lines disappeared, but the numbers of the scorpions are still shining. "Siegel, I am your friend, your only true, de facto, eternal friend. At the same time, I am still your brother, only a few blood brothers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel did not say anything. He has too many questions to ask, too many doubts need to be answered, but I don't know where to ask. Turner seems to know this too, so he said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the scorpions are from the creation god, the artifact they made by themselves. But not the world, nor the creation god of any world, but A god who has no work but has the ability to create a world. His existence is very short, and the only and most important thing is a few of us. It is no surprise that many races and creatures are created by God, dwarves, half-lengths. People and orcs are not with this. But this god is too careless and throws us into this world that is about to be destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what he thinks The fear of dying made him unconscious. At that time, only I woke up, and all of you were still in the state of artifacts. My only mission, the only thought after my existence was to let the brothers live. I can live in the world and experience the joy of life and the joy of life. It happens that I have the ability to be born. The most balanced thing is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel asked: "The most you said. What does it mean to be your scorpion's ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the rule meaning represented by the artifact." Turner said: "The so-called artifact is the rule. Entity exists. I don't know how our father determines the ability based on numbers, but I know what my abilities are: equalize everything and form the most stable state. So I can stop the storm. Let the annihilated and surviving formations equalize and gain time for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, my mind was simple, I just wanted to save you, I never wanted to be The gods of this world have discovered.” When it came to this, Turner gritted his teeth, waved his arms and jumped and jumped, and his feet stepped on the ground one after another. "The greedy guys, they want the power of rules in the scorpion, they want to reach the height of the god of creation! Even those race gods, elves, dwarves, gnomes and orcs, they want to learn how to create a race of their own The world of paradise! Robbers, scammers, shameless scums!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you protect your nephew?" After Siegel asked, he himself I already want to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ability is balance, it is to achieve balance, it is a compromise. The gods are mutually restrained, I can see the embarrassment between them, and then I can construct a Zhang Dawang, all of them are captured." When it comes to the triumph, Turner smiles slyly, with a mockery of the gods. "They are trapped by their own vows and can only observe and not influence and interfere. I use the strongest binding oath in the multiverse to build a protection net for us. This big net will filter between the scorpion and the gods. Interaction, they can't hear your prayers, and you won't get their blessings and curses. But I don't think there is any real blessing, because true blessings never bring conditions, and you won't have to do this. That’s it! They are a group of swindlers who deceive the world’s dog things!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that when it comes to the gods, Turner has no good temper, and a few words have already been It is a mild attitude. Siegel waited for him to vent, then asked: "Do you know what other scorpions represent? Why can't I light the twentieth scorpion myself."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner made a sly laughter, but then he cried, tears streaming from the muddy eyes, and soon went back into two small rivers. He burst into tears and cried, and he turned his back and did not let Siegel see it. Siegel doesn't know why this is, and he doesn't know how to comfort him. He can only persuade him to calm down, sad things - no matter what it is - has passed, don't hurt because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
