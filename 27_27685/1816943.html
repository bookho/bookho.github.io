			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are purely asking yourself for trouble, what time is it, and thinking about saving the world?" Merchant A played with his own staff on the side of the three A gimmick, let them make a squeaky crack in the collision. "You become a god, and you don't owe anything to others. Why do you want to go out for them? Don't tell me about responsibility, obligation, or something. We are a mage, not a paladin whose brain has burned out!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the mage sitting across the table, not knowing what method to describe him. Absolute self-interest and liberalism? No bastard with a lower limit? But he is not the kind of person who is ruining everywhere. All actions come from precise calculations and meticulous steps, not from impulsiveness and brute force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey is sitting aside and listening to the conversation between the two wizards. He seldom makes speeches and never criticizes any party. Even in the face of the quarrel between the two sides, he will agree with their respective views. In his view, the so-called dispute between good and evil is meaningless. The simplest philosophy in the world is what you don't want to bear and don't add to others. In this respect, there is nothing wrong with Siegel, who exudes the light, and the merchant who is full of evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My current situation is not suitable for arguing about these things with you," Siegel pointed to his head, and the fire was still hidden and ready to go. I am causing trouble. "I can't enter your half-plane, I have been waiting for three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be fine in a little while." Merchant A cuts again. A piece of sheep is discharged into his plate, and he seems to have eaten this food. "The position of this crystal wall is too biased. It is really not easy to find the road on the half-plane. If it is not for this guy called Lynch, you have to wait a month after you want to receive the goods."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three mages have their own areas of expertise, and regardless of personality and worldview, at least in the field of magic is admired. Lynch has great experience with higher creations, artifacts, and space spells; Siegel is proficient in the most basic but most powerful elemental forces, distributed thinking and cloning can turn individuals into clusters; merchants are in legendary spells. The rules of erosion and suppression, as well as the Necromancer spells are unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, this sale is a big profit. The half-face is not made by me, it is just something I found. But the energy of unlimited energy. Mystery can be nuclear, hey, it’s a good thing. I can change a lot of good things as long as I sell it. The fire is possible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkey shook his head "Shenzhen is not a good thing. In addition to improving the safety of unexpected situations, it is not good for your own development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can sell money "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "What is the use of money? It is better to spend more on the residents of the Territory."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only agree with the part that I spent." The merchant waved his hand: "Oh, the half-face is coming soon, and this place is too dangerous. When is it not allowed?" It will be destroyed by the devastating storm. Although the sheep are unexpectedly delicious, I want to hand over as soon as possible and then leave as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is the only place in the multiverse that can observe the storm of destruction at close range. Every one has its own value. Have you not found it yet?" Lynch didn't know why he said this. It seems that he wants to stay in the merchant for a while. . What he can do here, Siegel can't help thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at the devastating storm is rare, but my little life is the only thing in the world, I can’t easily take risks." Lynch, eyebrows pick: "If you have anything, just say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Siegel has a spell in addition to the secret nuclear, Lin Qi said: "He used this spell to return me a favor, I think I made a big profit. Without the help of divine power, without the help of resurrection, you can help you escape almost all the mortal situation, and you can regain your youth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, what do you see? This spell I want to trade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I invite you to join our research group." Lynch said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can he help with the study of spells? And cloning is my spell, and it is up to me to trade." Siegel objected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I refuse." Merchant A said: "I still have my own things to do, not to waste time in your dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Time is exactly the direction we want to study.” Lynch said: “The real time mobility, isn't it worth your time to research?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Linchi, have you ever thought about what to do if he abuses this power?" Siegel was dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The multiverse is always balanced, and there can be no only heavens, there must be an abyss." Lynch explained: "According to my experience, If you really want to find the secret of time, you might need power from the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can extend my life and still keep my youth forever, then I am I can take part of it to play with you. After all, I still have to earn." The businessman smiled. "You two strong enough, but such a temperament character will definitely be killed in the multiverse. The world of dying is proof that someone will forcibly carry this kind of trouble? So I should take care of you. Oh, halfway, I have already felt that its entrance is connected. Waiting for me to prepare for the battle, complete Naturally, I will call you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between a plane and a half plane is actually whether there is a rule barrier and how the barrier is generated. The half-plane or the reaction caused by the collision energy between the crystal walls, or some strong masters, gods using mantras. The regular nature of the plane originated at the beginning of the birth of the world, and the future generations could not be modified if they could not get out of this barrier. But the rule boundary of the semi-planet completely depends on the skill of the manufacturer and has no stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of God is actually a half-face, with the will of the gods as a barrier, the rules move with the heart, very flexible. When the gods fight, most of the time will be spent on the engulfment of the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God. In fact, it is the fusion of the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because instability will be fused, there will be very few opportunities for the semi-planet to become very big, and this huge world in front of the three mages is absolutely No one. "It has been merged many times, and it is very fortunate that every fusion is with the other half-plane, so it has not been invaded by the rule seed. As long as you are using it, don't let it be close to the crystal wall or the outer domain, It’s absolutely safe.” Merchant A with three people flying in the semi-plane, there are already basic elements, forming the ocean, and sporadic islands full of coconut trees. "The coconut tree was planted by me, mainly to prove that it can make life prosper, and you can raise the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you solve the lighting problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stole a track, letting this half-plane pass from the twin paradise from time to time, along with some positive energy. Negative energy is easier to handle, this aspect I won't say more." He looked at Siegel: "This is even more of a problem for you. With the secret nuclear, I am not surprised if you make a sun."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is too little land here, and the ocean is just water, it can't feed people." Siegel was somewhat dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main body of the half-plane is like this. I don't know who the buyer will be. Can't you set the environment in advance?" Merchant A is ready. How to answer this question: "The original clause only requires that the guarantee can make life alive, and it is big enough to be satisfied here. If you want a specific environment, you need to buy an environmental package and you need to add money."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linchi waved his hand and said, "No. I can move a piece of land from your world directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There are two continents in the world of the thunder wall. If you add the power provided by the secret nuclear, Lynch can move one of them to this half-plane. Of course, such action means the collapse of the world of thunder walls, and there is no time to move another continent. "In this process, you need to have enough power to stabilize the rules of the semi-planet, and you can't let the storm destroy it. Don't think it's very simple. The storm of destruction is specifically for the crystal wall, not interested in the half-plane. But In the process of carrying the space, this half-plane will coincide with the world of your thunder wall. If the rule of the crystal wall is immersed in it, then the storm of destruction will be able to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How much crack do you need to open in space to complete the move?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linchi thought for a moment, licking his fingers and calculating: "This level of space spells will speed up the destruction of the original world, so you must hurry up, The crack can't be too small, otherwise it won't get much area. I use the full force to fold the space, and I will leave a big hole with a radius of 16 miles. Considering that the shape may be irregular, you can calculate it by the radius of eighteen miles."
