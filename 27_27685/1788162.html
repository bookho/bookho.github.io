			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are to the goal you are trying to achieve, the more nervous Siegel is. It has nothing to do with whether he is a mage or not, whether he is strong or not, only with his personality. related. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sixteen years of Siegel’s life were spent at sea. As an orphan, the closest to the loved one is the old captain. Other people are close friends, brothers who can entrust their backs, but they lack the feeling of a family. Only in the old captain can he find the peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of the old captain, he also left the sea and came to the New World. Although he is eager to take risks in his heart, it is hard to say that it is not a choice to escape the pain of losing loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His luck is good, met Sir Bill. Despite the sternness, Sir Bill made up for the part he needed to be affectionate, and he relied on his early adventure. It was only a short period of less than a year, but when it was time to get along, Siegel moved the old feelings of the old captain to Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they separated again, this time the dwarf Elinette came to Siegel with meticulous care, so that his life would not be fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there is no home in Siegel on the New World. His home is at sea, between the cabin of the Sos and Haitian. Even if he wanted to find that feeling, the Soth was long gone—a sudden storm destroyed the keel of the ship, and the Soss sank in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike others, he keeps praying to the gods, but he has never responded, so he is also an orphan in faith. Even the most inclusive mother of the earth turned a blind eye to even the smallest request from Siegel. No matter who he confides to, he will not receive any relief in his heart. Many times he can only fall asleep with his lonely heart, and he is his only companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Janet and Janet like to make him back again, and his own territory also makes him feel home again. He tried his best to protect this feeling, almost at all costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers his favorite time, when he believed that the elf could become his own alliance against Knox, he thought that the determined dwarf would be himself forever. Friends and alliances, he also bitterly persuaded Janet to go to the Elven Forest to treat bloody diseases. He also believes that relying on his own magical power can solve all problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not even know the whereabouts of his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all. I still can't master my destiny. Even though the rational part of his mind is very clear-headed, knowing that Jain's anxiety and impulsiveness are not helpful in solving problems, and these are shortcomings in character. But understanding does not mean that it can be corrected. Understanding does not mean that it can be overcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot always rely on the form of the undead to suppress the fluctuations in the soul and emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Siegel. Squid." So he said: "This face is made of makeup and magic materials."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading...the Lord's Lord?" The surprise on Yao En's face is not false: "We guessed that you forged the appearance, but did not think that you would be the Earl of Sigel. But your spell level... no wonder it can make Naria nervous and worried. Why do you expose your identity now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I can't think completely calmly now, I need your help.” Siegel said: “I know that incomplete information will have a big impact on the layout and even endanger the implementation of the entire plan. This task is very important to me, I am determined to avoid any Unstable factors, including myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yao En, if you don't show excellent leadership on the road, I won't tell you. This secret. My mission is to find the stronghold of the murder god and rescue one inside. Personal. But I am not sure what this person is like here. What I used to do is all from the elves, and this action is part of the peace agreement between Heim and the elves. I thought I would not Lost state, I have been able to stay calm forever, but I found myself unable to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel points to his chest: "The power of magic is like the waves Ups and downs, I can control these, but after all, there is more powerful power than magic. I can face the threat or temptation of the devil. But it does not mean that I will never fear. I am not in the best state, so I need you to I share. I know this is not part of your team's mission, but I ask you to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel said: "But please don't tell everyone about this news for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem." Yao En said: "But you also know the character of Ai Meng, extra work requires extra compensation. And you certainly won't have another 1,500 gold coins? Is it not worthwhile to pay for yourself?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A word is fixed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I need to think about it." Yao En squats The beard on the chin came and went in front of Siegel. After a while, he looked up and said, "Can I think your level of magic is high? How high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you go all out, I can ruin the castle of Kaibu Town in an hour; I can summon hundreds of elemental creatures to the enemy; I can use a chain of lightning to form a devastating network in the front of a few tens of meters. I can also return to the city of Mystery with one thought. Right. Jage will betray you to the Solidarity whenever he has a chance. This is already buried in the depths of his mind. I noticed it when I cast the spell." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En took a breath of air and began to walk back and forth with his beard and frowning. "Okay. These are more than my understanding, so I don't know how to apply your power most reasonably. The only thing I can believe is that you will do your best in this mission, isn't it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's go to Shaq Manor now. Yao En said: "And you can't let the people in the town find that we are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be done."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mage prepares for the corresponding spell, he can be more proficient in fighting than the warrior, and can be more adept at stealing than the assassin. Siegel and Yao En left the town like two breeze, passing through the gap between the dense branches of apple trees. Avoiding the nose and ears of the most sensitive watchdogs, and even avoiding the magical detection enchantment hidden between the heavens and the earth, they reorganized their bodies after a bush a hundred meters away from Shak Estate. Siegel activated a dwarf runestone that allowed two people to blend into the earth. Except for rock-sensitive dwarves, others are hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the precision telescope from the space bag, which was more expensive than all the lenses of Yao En. "I also have a real gem here, you can use it at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rich lord." Yao En shook his head: "It is rare to find a big gold master. It seems that I have to complete this task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Siegel knows that gnomes are not the kind of people who are greedy, but deliberately Said to ease the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bushes they hide are the last laps outside Shaq Manor, and there are less than three inches of lawn. Don't say that it is hidden, even a big mouse is not in the body. The manor is separated by a wall made of bricks and iron railings. There are always people cleaning the lawn while patrolling the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a manor rather than a castle, otherwise there will be an arrow tower, a lookout whistle and a heavily guarded guard. A tall white house is in the center of the fence and is solitary. Apart from it, there are no stables, no warehouses, no gardens. There are no hidden places within 200 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am not a mage, I can still feel the feeling of magical fluctuations around." Yao En looked at the telescope for a while and said: "All windows They all pull the curtain and can't see the inside. Jay, can you enter the manor without touching the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, maybe not, only tried I know.” Siegel explained: “I don’t have access to the core of the defensive matrix, only the outermost layer, so there is no guarantee that the method of cracking will not touch the deeper trap mechanism.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't touch it first." Yao En said: "This estate can be sure that there is a problem. But it is not the base of the murder god but needs Further confirmation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, let's take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
