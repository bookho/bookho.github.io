			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second day, Siegel gradually began his plan, starting with a map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pet Barron stopped on his shoulder and followed the wizard all the way through the winding courtyard to the tent where Fazak lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the pigeon?" Siegel asked: "I remember that you wrote in your report, have you bought two caged pigeons?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, pigeons can't be used, you need to wait for their next generation." One-eyed replies replied: "It's not a hand-trained pigeon that is likely to have other owners, it will leak." The secret of the letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, as long as they can fly, it will be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fazak came to the stables with Siegel, which was not completely covered yet, but there were no problems with storing a few cages. The gray-selling pigeons saw Fazak, fluttering their wings to ask for something to eat, but they all calmed down after hearing the old man's whistle. Siegel said to Fazak in an admirable tone: "I didn't expect your skill to be really good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result of many years of being a spy. Fitzak replied with a smile: "The pigeons are here, a total of fifty. Although it is not possible to send a letter to the designated place, but already knows to fly back after flying out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sufficient, give them to me." Siegel put the magic pet down and began to cast spells. The wizard's magic pet can talk to the same kind, and thus become a bridge of communication between humans and animals. It is said that the druids in the forest can talk directly to the animals, but Siegel now has no time to find a son of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the pigeon is to detect the terrain and then tell the raven about the situation, and the raven will re-detect the key position. The magic pet Baron screamed and flew to the antlers of the Uther family behind the pigeons. When the birds were released, Siegel had the same number of eyes staring at his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the eyeliner established by merchants, mercenaries, and chores is constantly transmitting information back, most of which are less important information, but Can help Siegel sketch the situation of the Uther family. Their territory is ten times that of Heim's collar, including three large castles and two small forts. They are owned by the Uther family and his vassals. It is said that fifty knights have sworn for him, which means that he can mobilize about a thousand troops. This is not a big number compared to the orc army. But Uther has a wide range of contacts, and if he wants to deal with Heim's collar, the southern lords will definitely unite and stand behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building an army is a long process. Siegel understands this very well, and all the southern lords are very clear. Maybe within a year or two, they will take Heim as an insignificant potential opponent, but Siegel will not build his victory on the enemy's slack. He searched for useful information in the intelligence pile and began to map the south with the help of the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five days. The scouts flying in the air all returned, and the sky also had heavy rain at this time. The continuous rain is like pouring from the sky, and you can't see things ten meters away. The construction of the castle had to be temporarily suspended, and only indoor work could be carried out. In the highlands of the city of Mire, there is a flood of water. The tents in the original courtyard are all incapable of living. All the dwarves, half-orcs and humans are concentrated in the castle hall to temporarily avoid the heavy rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in Shield River is okay, without causing flooding." Mana took off the already wet cloak and took over the ginger juice that Moer handed over. The ale, then said: "The valley in the east is like a bottomless pit. The swallows are swallowed up. If someone tells me that it is a swamp mouth, I absolutely believe."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation with the village?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The house was smashed and several people were injured, but the situation is not serious. Now the weather can't be rescued, even the phantom is not fast. I can only wait until after the weather is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I know, take a break," Siegel said. The knight nodded and took the cup in her hand to find the nearest fire. She had to warm up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet is with Siegel. After Mana left, he asked, "Do you have any thoughts? Recently, you always see your frowning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you thinking about how to deal with them?" Janet laughed like a flower, but hurriedly grabbed her mouth before Siegel was angry. "I know that you are very smart, there are so many tricks in your heart. And countless magic spells are always at your service. I saw you commanding the pigeons to fly into the sky that day, and I still admire them, if I can command my cat like that. How good is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can teach you," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can also teach you." Janet glared at the wizard's arms and said softly: "You rarely deal with nobles, don't know them. The more you try to deal with them. The more happy you are, the more happy they are, because they finally find something to do with boring time. It’s not like a duel between fighters, with a sword against the sword, only this monotony The way you don't have to take the initiative, you just need to be stronger, they will naturally tame it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janet, they won't. Siegel said: "They won't sit up and watch a new lord rise from Heim. You may not know, I recently sorted out the map of the whole south and suddenly found something. The stagnant water swamp has been extending eastward. It’s already wider than it was a few decades ago. Maybe this year, maybe next year, it will cut off the road that the southern lords are heading north from the land. And when I was a sailor, I knew that the southern unscrupulous port, the rocky cliffs let them Most of the trade depends on the brook - The two-story wharf is already the best seaport in the south. It will not be long before the southern lords will find that their only safe road to the north is the ore boulevard, and my Heim collar is just standing here. On the road, it will become a place of contending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are safer." Janet has a different opinion, she said: " Have you been thinking about the aristocrats uniting to deal with you? Believe me, if that's the case, as long as you don't take the initiative, there will be no danger in this life. They can allow a new lord to occupy the place because they believe You will not be subject to you. But a strong aristocrat will occupy the place, and they will not tolerate it. In order to avoid this situation, they will restrict each other and drag the big nobility, and give no reason for conflict. Siegel, You already have countless natural allies, but you don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master frowned, and spent a lot of effort to understand Janet's words. "Every sentence you said is very reasonable, but why can't I think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You live at sea, and you are looking at the vast world." Janet comforted him. "I live in the middle of the wall and the lane of the starry kingdom. There are intrigues and intrigues everywhere. I have a lot of knowledge in one aspect and become my ability and specialty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in your advice, Janet," Siegel said: "What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do what you are best at." Janet said: "You want to use various strategies to deal with the nobles, and you give up the field that you are best at. You are a mage, when you can fly to heaven. At that time, the cavalry will be ineffective for you; when you can sneak into the ground, the border will be ineffective for you. When you are strong enough, the nobles will be ineffective for you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siegel heard it, he patted his forehead hard and then hugged Janet"I understand, the kitten, my thoughts have entered a dead end. Even if I use more knowledge to analyze and come up with the best strategy, it is just the operation of the lord. Francis Baker The one that is given to me is still the skill that the Master needs to help the Lord, not the means of a Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the map in his hand to Janet The strokes outline all the terrain around the Heim collar. You can see the curved shield river, the three villages with the finished glyph distribution and the rift of the dead water swamp. In the south of Heim's collar, there is a rift caused by an earthquake. There are still frequent earthquakes, and the land collapses and falls into the dark caves that are bottomless. The rift is uninhabited and is the border between the Heim and the southern lords. Further south, it is the fertile Vaughan County, a small territory dominated by barley and sugar beet. The Hugel family has lived there for two hundred years and is a place where there is no competition. Lapu Lake is located in the southeast of Vaughan County, but it belongs to the powerful Helei family and is part of Jiamei House. Even if it is suitable for marriage with the Hugel family in Vaughan County, it still dominates the production of the lake. The Hera family and the Uther family also have friction, mainly concentrated on the iron ore they are bordering. The two sides accused each other of stealing their own mineral deposits, but they never broke out of real conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in the South is very complicated. I can't think of a safe way, so I have been having a headache lately. But I understand now that these are not what I am good at." Something.” Siegel pointed his finger at the location of the city of Mire, gently rubbing: “I just do what I am good at, focus on turning this place into the strongest in the South. As for the means between the nobles... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
