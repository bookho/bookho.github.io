The Rune Master of Mora has only done the core and is currently handed over to a gnome merchant. Siegel replied: "If you go to the top of Mora, you can buy such a product, the price should be around 30,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The half-elf thought about it and said to Siegel in a more respectful manner: "Mr. Master, don't you know if I am honored to have dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Beside the market in the hills, there is a small path covered with white stones, which is one of the few stone roads in the Elven Forest. Siegel and the half-elf went side by side, followed him to the door of a low lodge. The house is not eye-catching, and there are no businessmen gathered around it. It seems to be isolated and isolated. There was a wooden square table in front of the room, and a plate of freshly crystallized fruit was placed in the middle of the table. When the two men approached, a few silver-gray leaves fell from the tree, and a few squirrels were stunned. They ran away from the table, and the gangs were round and bulging, which seemed to be rewarding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Master, here is my home, my wife's craftsmanship is very good, especially stewed rabbits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves knocked on the door and said a few words, the door opened silently. His wife is a human being. He doesn't look old, he is only fifteen or six years old, and his nose and cheeks are still freckled. She is always shy and shy, seems to rarely leave the house, standing in the door frame and nodding to Siegel. Later, she took out two cups of steaming tea, then quickly closed the door and went to the kitchen to go busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My wife and I met in the Old World and joined together for freedom and love." The half-elf said to Siegel: "The Elves of the New World The kingdom is our sanctuary, and the life here is quiet and peaceful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the teacup, took a light drink, and sat down at the table: It is not easy for you to bring your wife to the New World."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. There are too many people obstructing along the way, but this will not stop us from yearning for freedom. Heart." The half-elf said: "I introduce myself, Hai'an. Liaton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sos," Siegel still uses the pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf smiled and took a sip of the cup in front of him and said, "Mr. Soth. I know that the time of the Master is very precious, so I am going to see you. I want your earth element warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can buy this kind of thing after Mora, why do you have to find me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I know that you are the key." The half-elves showed a confident smile and said, "As a businessman. I have been paying attention to the direction of Mola." Caravan, so I know that the dwarf doesn't have this kind of product yet, but your tone is not hesitant and uncertain. It is not a fake to say that the item is sold. Other than that. I also said the price of this item, which shows that you are very clear about the ins and outs of the earth element warrior. Plus you are a mage, then this thing is very clear: unless the wizard union out of the ghost, will Good things are secretly sold to dwarves, otherwise there is only one person on this continent. It's more clear than the dwarfs that this new spell is a problem - you are one of the researchers of this earth element warrior spell, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently Applause, but did not admit or deny it. The two looked at each other for a while, then he twisted his chair and found a comfortable posture. He said, "You are a smart person. And you know something about the spell. Then you think I will sell the earth element guard to you. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It depends on what you need to come to the Elf Forest." Hai'an said: "I heard from the merchants that you are summoning elemental guards for the vigil. But I think you must have a deep meaning, and want to attract the attention of the wizard wizard. Don't say anything else, there is a spell that I know that can open the rest space out of thin air, it is not difficult to master. You can not expose it. The existence of a persistent element warrior. And since you choose this, you must have an urgent matter, and in the elf high-level you lack a friend who can speak, I think I can serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the fastest and smartest person I have ever met." Siegel said: "In fact, I did not expect that I still have so many flaws. It seems that The phrase 'Shoumi is the greatest reliance of the Master' No, I bully "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Siegel did not immediately agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf wife pushed the door open and carried a steaming stew. Her steps were awkward and seemed to be afraid of being close to Siegel. Came around an arc. The half-elf leaned on the chair and his eyes were still focused on Siegel. The mage frowned and gently swung his finger. The stew was separated from the girl's hands and landed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pot of stewed meat with mushrooms and onions. Each piece of rabbit meat is cut to the same size and quietly waiting to be tasted in the creamy soup. A few green leaves of vanilla floated on the soup surface, covering the greasy surface. The half-elf's wife saw that she had nothing in her hand, her face was red and red, and she ran back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is really very shy." Siegel said: "How did you bring her from the Old World?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of love is very great. It allows ordinary people to do great feats that they can't even imagine." The half-elf used a long spoon to stir the stew and said: "Come on Try it, this is a rare dish in the New World."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled: "I really don't know if I can still eat in the Elven Forest. Meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's strange about this, the elves don't ban hunting." Hai'an said: "Their bow and arrow technology is so superb, not from hunting. Learning? Yes, they are mainly vegetarian, but they have never been banned from meat. But they don’t feed animals like humans, they just take it from nature. This kind of behavior is not really brilliant.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a bowl of stew for himself, blowing the heat of the surface, but a bite Drink, bowl gently. The half-elf looked at the bowl in the hands of the wizard with a little regret, and then took a sip of his soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have a prejudice against the elves," Siegel asked. "Can you tell me if you can reach those high-level?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf smiled and waved his hand, then used the index finger to point to the table and said: "The elves are self-deprecating, but they are just a creature. They It is essentially the same as humans, dwarves, and orcs, and needs to eat and drink." He paused. Then he said: "I am sorry that I use vulgar words, but this is the truth. After all, even beautiful women, when they have children, need to experience the test of life and death, and they are so embarrassed. They can barely seek survival. The elves are also like this. No more noble than other races. As long as you understand this, you know that the elves are also asking for something, so you can get in touch with them and make connections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Specific point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deputy captain of the Elf Guard. The high priest of the Moon Temple and the master of the art research." Haian said: "If You want to let the news people know that I know a few good troubadours. They often go to the high elves' houses, play musical instruments and sing poetry for them. As long as you tell me what you need to convey, I can Help you do everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you only want exclusive rights to the elemental warrior?" Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I think this is a good business, you will be able to talk to Mora and give me this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the pipe, ignited it and put it on his mouth, so that the smoke would spread between the two. With the cover, his hand grabbed the wand hidden in the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK." Siegel said: "The problem you asked is not big. It is just a little effort for me. But it has been said for so long. Hungry. Let your wife take some bread, just to match the soup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves shouted into the room and saw his little wife. I came out with a bread basket. Siegel’s result was that the bread was split in half and then given to the half-elf, and then suddenly asked the little girl: “Do you know there is a poisonous mushroom in the soup?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The little girl groaned and leaned over and looked down at the soup. Siegel suddenly stood up and pulled back, using a wand on the woman's neck. He recited a spell in his mouth and let the magic of detecting thoughts be released. As expected, there is a memory in the woman's mind that is covered by magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver flash went straight to Siegel’s face. The spell of the protective arrow takes effect instantly and bounces it off. Siegel made an arc and hit the protective spell on Hai'an. The shock wave formed by the spell collided the poor woman and fell into the bushes. Fainted past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai An smiled and shook his head. "Don't worry, there won't be a wizard wizard here, you can die with confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to ask me how it is. See the flaws?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then give you time to escape?" The half-elf face is gloomy. But I still have a smile: "I will find the answer from your memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestures in the air, Hainan is the same, they The game before the spell duel. From the mouth shape of the other party's singer spell and the gesture of casting spells, guess the opponent's spell sequence and restrain it in advance. It is like two swordsmen tempting each other with a virtual move to find out the flaws of the other side to launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hai’an has a lot of experience, he can always find Siegel’s spell intent at the first time, but he can’t keep up with his speed. The elemental power circled around the young mage, gradually forming an order, forming the first spell of the ball of light. This is the ability of the spell system to strengthen the mage, and save the power that is summoned, so that it can be concentrated to form an intensive attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haian breathlessly, and watched the ball of light, it is a very simple spell: the primary summoning elemental creature (fire), his biggest effect However, it is a small fire element of a child's body. What can it do? And why the summoning spells are not released directly, at least forcing opponents to distract. Although the spell-enhanced mage can temporarily suppress the spell function, most of them choose the control effect such as flash explosion and stink cloud, so that the enemy can not completely resolve it at once - what is the tactic of this small fire element summoning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel continues to speed up the hand, he even used the wizard's martial arts to improve the effect. Hai'an cold sweat DC, he can keep up with the corresponding speed. Another light ball floated from the side of Siegel, still a secondary summoning fire element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf gave up the plan to catch up with Segal's hand speed and began to concentrate on destroying the formation of the opposite spell. He believes that he is more than the opposite young man in the accumulation of spells and the tuning of magical energy. After all, he can exhaust the mental concentration of the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel does not seem to be in a hurry, while moving around the circular arc of Hai'an, while continuing to strengthen his own spells. The light ball makes a pulsating sound in the air, and it begins to flex and expand regularly like the active heart. Haian is a bit worried, never seen such a wonder: the curse can save spells without false, but never heard that they can strengthen these spell balls in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only half a minute for the secondary summoning of the fire element to increase the intensity, and has reached the summoning elemental medium fire element. Hai'an smiled and asked: "Is this your ability? Will it continue to enhance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Siegel's tone is steady and promptly answered Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you won't believe it." Siegel The technique suddenly changed, like a volley writing, with the forefinger and middle finger in the front to portray the blunt symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this spell?" Hai'an couldn't understand it at all, so he could only give up the spell counter-attack and had to choose to take the risk offense. His palms are close together, his hands are blooming like flowers, and the energy of the fire elements is brewing in both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s wrist turned, and a dwarf rune shines in the air. This is a silent rune, which the dwarf used to ambush the Knights of Liberty. The runes that Siegel temporarily portrayed in the air can only last for half a minute, but enough to silence all the sounds within 30 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells that have been formed will not be affected, but the newly created spells can only choose those that do not need to be cursed. The two balls of light floating behind Siegel are actually the effect of the fire element rune guard, and he is disguised as a mantra to strengthen the master's power. Elemental guards can only act with mental commands, and shielding sounds has no effect on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the burning hand that has been condensed can also be fired normally. Siegel had long discovered that the wizards of the Knox Association liked to use this spell and guessed that they had improved this low-pole spell, but they never saw it. He ordered the fire element to give up the advantage of the pinch, block it in front of himself and launch an attack from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the dust of the stars, ready to change position at the moment of the half-elf spell firing, speeding up the killing from the side without the power of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
