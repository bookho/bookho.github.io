			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the giants have spent their ups and downs in the conference room, and they have improved each other again. Promote cooperation and face new eras and new situations. Especially on the issue of the visit of the zenith star, after a fruitful quarrel, the final agreement was reached: take the Zenith star and tear down his spaceship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Zenith Star Jialan successfully boarded the spacecraft and successfully took off. The army that has stayed near the landing point has been beaten and lost its fighting ability - without its vitality, it naturally has no fighting power. The formation consisting of two hundred and fifty fighters all became fragments of the volley explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien spacecraft was unscathed according to the images transmitted by the high-altitude satellites. Or more accurately, the damage has been automatically restored. According to its current speed and direction, it will take two hours to reach the "Red Dot Gnome", the largest shipbuilding port in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goblin giants are not panicked. They are all generals who have been tested on the battlefield. The situation is now more adaptable than the meeting. And "red dot goblin" is a good goblin kingdom, but it does not reach the standard of the giant - in other words, it is cannon fodder. What is the relationship between cannon foci and damage? The giants consciously have enough time to develop tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ship is not invincible, its attack means is single, and the armor is not very thick. According to the spectrum, the main component of the shell is ordinary. Steel.” The Gnome Researcher’s report made the Goblin giants very happy, and as long as their current means can cause harm, they will definitely be able to knock it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it necessary to use a nuclear bomb now?" Dark brown goblin squinted, his eyes turned and spewed a cigar smoke and said: "I am afraid of nuclear bombing. Going down, the spaceship melts into molten steel, which can be detrimental to eating the flesh inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature is not that step, after all, I don’t see it. What is the power of the spaceship.” The bald goblin put the big leather boots with iron thorns on the table, **** lying on the chair, holding a glass of spirits in his hand. He is more relaxed than the dark brown goblin, which shows that he is more powerful than the dark brown goblin - or at least it looks like this. "Give him a city bombing, what other means to see it. With thirty-six high-speed guns can not create a threat to the bones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That can't let him go so safely and all the way." Dark brown goblin bombed the ash. Gently shaking his fingers: "Go to the red dot goblin, our army is on the way, and now I want to see if he has spare time, can you fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the culture of the goblin. A goblin who can't fight either waits to die or die immediately. The red dot goblin knows that if they can't perform well, the goblin "compatriots" who come together for the alien spacecraft will not hesitate to occupy their own island. So the head of the goblin with a small red hair under the nose issued an order to block the zenith starship. "Get all the weapons out, I mean everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, without predicting the spell, Siegel can also know that the goblin is gathering forces, toward him and The star number killed. He is now like a magnet, firmly attracting the attention of the whole world. It’s been a week away, which should be a rare holiday for the dwarf saints of Mora. The nuclear warheads that bombed the amethyst are probably aimed at the magic spaceship. He even has a feeling of being locked by Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any nuclear bomb is enough to cause serious damage to the star, or even directly back to the body. But this is nothing, just project again. If Siegel is fully committed, there are no problems with three round trips per day. It is to use war of attrition. It is also enough to hit or even destroy the resistance of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what will be left like that? A riddled earth that was hit by a nuclear bomb? Maybe the goblin is a slap in the face, and the whole dead light can't make the enemy win, so use the nuclear bomb to blow up his own world? If this scale of damage occurs, it is not known whether the crystal wall channel can withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that the dwarf saint does not have the ability to destroy a planet, and he should not be able to withstand the ability to destroy a planet. Even with the help of divine help and the advantages of the rules, Siegel is not sure that the power of the planet's destruction will not pass through the wall barrier to the other side. Although this possibility is not great, wise people should not ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes have used two warnings, only the last time. Siegel is ready to be bombed back to the astral by nuclear bombs, and he is ready to come again. I have spent so much time on my busy schedule. I hope that the goblin can grasp it. They can develop technology to such a level, and there will be no intellectual problems. As long as you can produce a little spark of wisdom at the last minute, regain the strongest power hidden in all living things: the survival of the fittest, learning to adapt, change and compromise for survival. Then there is hope to create a different situation in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rhythmic "squeaky" voice echoed in the control room. It turned out that Xingsuo was "dubbing" for his own electromagnetic gun. She has slowly learned to hand over the control of the artillery to the para-brain operation, so she can observe it from the perspective of half a bystander, so every time she fires, she will make a "squeaky" sound. There are sporadic counterattack forces, such as aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. These are the targets of practicing electromagnetic gun attacks. There are also bridges, roads, and moving cars and trains that were all destroyed under the action of electromagnetic guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true rise of Heim’s collar began with a transmission array, but the idea of ​​a transmission array originated from the construction of a road that runs through the harbour to the walled mountains. Siegel has been living on the sea route since he was a child, knowing that transportation is the foundation of civilization. Now he is constantly fighting the traffic of the goblin, hoping to hurt them in this way and wake them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the electromagnetic guns enter the shift, use the repair and maintenance array to maintain them." Siegel interrupted the self-entertainment of the stars, " I estimate that a big fight will happen soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dot goblins have excellent organizational and coordination skills, and their military discipline is second to none, so they quickly assembled a large-scale counterattack. Thousands of various types of aircraft, the Kamikaze Combat Group, together with the maritime guided missile destroyer units that stored tens of thousands of warheads, came from all over the island. The ground-based long-range weapons hidden in the caves and the firepower hidden in the seabed form a three-dimensional strike network that they are proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make a hit, they even took out the two secret weapons at hand. One is a space-based laser weapon hidden in outer space in satellite form, and the other is a single-person flying robot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goblin Air Force pays attention to over-the-horizon strikes, which is the ability to launch missiles invisible to the naked eye. However, their line of sight does not represent the line of sight of the star. Nothing can escape the eyes of the stars unless it is blocked by the curved surface of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They rushed up, can I hit them down?" asked Xingsuo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and the spacecraft fired. In order to be able to attack further distances, the electromagnetic gun must use the acceleration technology that transmits multiple times to and fro, which affects the speed of shooting. After the first wave of shots hit four planes, the goblin began maneuvering, often changing the attitude and direction of the flight, causing the hit rate to fall again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the goblin entered the missile's range, it immediately launched a round, nearly a thousand missiles flew to the star, although it still takes a few minutes to really pose a threat, But it also makes the star cable a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, an attack from the seabed appeared. With the help of black clouds and sea water cover, the submarine force was able to reach the launch. Hundreds of modified submarine-launched missiles jumped out of the water, then ignited twice, and whistling into the belly of the star. This round of attack blew the horn of the red dot goblin attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground-based missiles began to launch one after another, forming an uninterrupted attack wave from all sides. The missile destroyer at sea began to accelerate, and immediately followed the rhythm and pace, and began to launch weapons. Using the remaining roads and railways, other ground forces are also approaching quickly – the individual flying robots are hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the war is too easy, you will be in trouble. More than half of them are ambushed, and more than half are sneaked." Xingsuo said: "The little guys are cheering, the more busy they are, the more calm they are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuolian’s energy is not available, and the electromagnetic gun does not break the fire. One hundred and eight deputy brains show their power, and they can simultaneously target one hundred and eight goals. The closest threat was submarine-launched missiles, and they were not hit fast when they jumped off the water, so they were hit first. Although the heavy dirty air blocks most of the line of sight, the electromagnetic gun can launch an attack as long as the propeller's flare is visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missile that was hit was exploding, and the flames were overwhelming, affecting the observation of other missiles by the star. There are still dozens of missiles that pass through the clouds and approach the spacecraft. The star snorted, and I remembered that I forgot to escape. Then the elemental jet propulsion system is turned on, and the horizontal and high-speed lateral translation is performed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This maneuver directly causes the bald goblin watching the squirting of the spirits in the mouth! The trajectory calculation equations written in the missiles all made mistakes. No goblin expected this situation. At least ten times the acceleration of gravity directly acts on such a huge manned aircraft. It's like an elephant suddenly has the flexibility of a rabbit! The missile lost its target and blindly searched for the original direction of the star's movement - of course nothing could be found. At this time, you only need to use one or two guns to slowly name the missile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
