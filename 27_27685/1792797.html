			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at Gerrard, a sympathetic rarity among the stubborn dwarves. He drank the ale in the corner cup, moistened the dry throat, and threw the cup to the servant. "So you admit that the dwarf is bullying good people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the letter from Irene on the table and said, "You know it." What did you write? Guess what my best dwarf friend would say? He would say that I am a good person, so come help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Shake his head. He can come to Heim to send a letter, and this errand is still what Irene has won for him. "He has seen Siegel, things will be easier to do." When you come to Heim, you can stay in the Heim collar, meaning you don't have to go to the front line to patrol. Although the residual power of the dwarf saints forms protection against any goblins trying to enter the walled mountains, patrolling is still a risky thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene did not say anything, just want to get together with me, have a drink together, eat barbecue, the last time." Siegel said "He said that the technique used by the goblin is very characteristic. If you are interested, go look for him. But in the two letters to the Federation's sergeant and the lord of Heim, the dwarf did not mention the goblin. What is this, is it a riddle? I don't know what you think, let's go and go and say what to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When good people are better than bad people It’s much harder, but it’s not a bad person, but a bad mood.” Siegel said: “Heim has the strength to help Mora’s sorrow through the current difficulties, and can also fight against the goblin. A force, but why don't I be happy when I do this? How do I feel that I am being used to be a bully?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Until now, the dwarf still used other people as fools, unable to take it out Sincerely, Elint knows me, so he wrote such a letter. He does not say that Morah’s and Heim’s collar, not to mention dwarves and humans, only to say that he and I, an old man and one still Curious young people. So I told you before. Fine gold pulp or blue dragon blood ink is not as important as this letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sits Going back to my chair, I took a few breaths. "Gerard, in that sentence, the ability to think rationally does not mean that you will do the most reasonable action. So I have to say those words to you, I need to vent. If it is other dwarves, I can listen to me patiently." Finished? Elinette can, but I love him, I can't get angry with him. And Mora has any other dwarf. Maybe now I have already fucked my fist. I know you can listen and understand, so That is to you, I can say these words. Irene estimates that I know this too. I think he proposed to let you come, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Gerard nodded, and now he finally understands why this messenger must be himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irenet will make plans, but more importantly, he will take care of his friends, just and affectionate." Siegel said: "If I guess it is correct, Mora will soon send a chamber of commerce delegation to come to Heim to negotiate with me about the trade. After the Elven War, the only territory that has not been destroyed by war is my Heim. Especially in agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture, food and meat dishes are sufficient to supply the top of the Mora. Outside the city of Mire, there is the largest adventurer gathering area in the New World, and even a trade union of adventurers and mercenaries can be established. The dwarves fill their hands. They will also find that the Jackdaw tribe on the prairie has strong maneuverability and combat power, and all the commercial roads in the north are under their control, even in the north of the Wall Mountain Range. Even if they want to go from the Old World. Come over, don't pass Heim's collar and jackdaw. You can't reach the top of Mora."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Mora’s must send someone, but they What will you say?" Siegel Cold Loudly. This snoring made Gerrard bow his head. "There is no stranger to the Mona of the Gem Clan. It is a strange place for me. I don't face the dwarf who has turned a blind eye to his allies and is not honest with himself. It is a strange race for me; no dwarf who has openly shared strategic and tactical intelligence. For me, it’s just a party in a war that has nothing to do with me. You said, in this case, is it necessary for me to see this caravan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel's words are like the snow and ice on the top of the Mora, harsh but real. The facts of coldness are in front of you, but can a few dwarves understand the twists and turns around them? The dwarf is a friendly, kind race. But it is never known for its understanding and ease of communication. What they think is right and what should be done, others should do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new managers came out of the war. They are more like soldiers. They like to start from the "enemy" and "me" and think about problems. Gerrard is very worried now, because Siegel is right, and soon there will be someone coming to Heim, hoping to build a more stable and larger commodity trade, especially herbs, leather, food and livestock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the caravan's people can't handle this matter well, maybe it will be like Siegel's saying that Heim is leading the blockade of the border and living in the coffin of Mora. Will the new leadership of the dwarf endure this situation? The answer is clear, the new war may break out, and this must have been as expected by the Master of the Master, Siegel. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel calculated that he does not need to attack Mora, only need to win one or two victories in the field, it is enough to make Mora The dwarf ruled layer was questioned. Now it is the dwarf saint who blocks the channel of the crystal wall. He represents the highest will of the dwarf, so the dwarf can't put the goblin in any way, and can't do it. Once Heim’s collar dragged the situation into a stalemate, it won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Mora’s Donkey, waiting for the dwarves from the Old World to send support, or begging for help from the Elven Forest? Far-water is not thrilled. Within a year, Mora’s shackles must be isolated. Then the dwarves’ convening of a conference on the whole continent will become a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not seen in Gerard’s thinking. He was just wondering if this would be one of Siegel’s plans to get the gem clan back to management. He likes the old days of the past, but he can't cooperate with such actions. Gerrard already wants to understand, and must avoid contradictions between the people of the Chamber of Commerce and Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is pea porridge, grilled clams and bread, but Gerrard has no feeling of staying. After bidding farewell to Siegel, he immediately went north to the top of Mora. Along the way, he was thinking about how to make the dwarves understand the whole thing, not because of the stubborn consequences of consistent stubbornness and stubbornness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he left, he prepared an extra piece of food, so Siegel invited Mana to eat with his family. Janet was busy taking care of Isaac and taught him to learn to use a spoon. Eat some simple liquid food. Mana didn't say a word, her eyes only stared at the food in the plate in front of her. She didn't seem to dare to look at the Sigel family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strengthen the alert and prepare for the defense of the Mora and the Elven Forest at the same time. The direction of the hub is also the focus, can not be taken lightly." When eating, Sieg Suddenly put down the knife and fork and said: "Do a plan, mark the location that can be used as a key defense, and then arrange the construction of the energy track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny Wrinkled. Waving his hand and letting the servant go all the way, then he said, "Are you sure you can fight it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you make this preparation, the chances of playing will be Halfway down.” Siegel looked at Mana and said, “Increase the inspection of the road and the caravan, and then tell me how many people can be occupied if the trade route is completely blocked.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lord Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one more thing, you know it, don't spread Go out.” Siegel patted her hand, “unless the goblin across the wall climbs to the ground. I won’t send any good guys from Heim to fight them. I know the knights. Looking forward to the battle, I want to build meritorious deeds and seal the land on the battlefield, but only when the dwarves who caused the war can’t hold on, and the threat comes directly to Heim’s collar, they can only be honest. By the time, you Help me pay attention to their emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Plainly, Lord of adults. "Mana withdrew his hand, quickly saw Janet look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I disagree." Janet suddenly said: "Siegel I know you too much, you don't want to send the knights to the battlefield, do you want to be yourself?" Go? Even if you are constantly summoning elemental creatures to fight, it is too dangerous, I don't agree!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, this is really the Lord's wife, except Janet. No one dares to talk to Siegel. Mana lowered her head and raised her ears to listen to Siegel's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you don't understand the enemy's situation, it's the warrior and the cannon fodder." Siegel smiled and replied: "The elemental army is the best cannon fodder." But that is too consuming my strength. I will build a cannon fodder army, you can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? What do you make? It won't be That kind of clay warrior?” Mana looked up: “The Shak Manor proved that it was a waste of resources. And the iron ore in our territory could not support the consumption of a lot of armor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem of steel and other resources will be solved soon, you don't have to worry about it. But even if steel becomes cheaper, I won't waste it on the rubber warrior. I want Let the weapons go up and fight themselves, I want to build a Golem army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
