			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research on the dust was launched immediately, and the factions of the federation sent the most elite forces to analyze the nature of the dust and to eliminate it. The method of influence. ∑,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard of the elf was late after three days, and then began the same work. Because of the fissures caused by the Elven War, the Federation did not want to ignore the elves, and the elves also acted independently because of their consistent pride. The three-way man gathered by the Mola's scorpion: the dwarves, the federation, and the elves, get along with each other but are distinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a ghost to win the goblin in this way." Wywood always thought of what he said in front of Siegel. The current situation is obviously not good, but no one can come up with a solution. The dwarves are stubborn, the elves are proud and lonely, and the human wizard lacks the support of the gods and the saints. "If you have information about higher spells, you should already be studying legendary spells now. How are you still dealing with dwarves and elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say this Now, focus on the things at hand. When you can understand the nature of the dust, the targeted defensive spells can be improved." Siegel looked at the surrounding colleagues and said to Verwood: "You should be about to become **Master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have mastered the space lock, and the eternal stagnation is almost the same." Verwood said: "Snowley Master is still poor. Some, but Wendy, the big fat man in the plastics department and the protection department, is also close to being a sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good." Siegel tone Very calm, continue to use the elements to wrap the dust, and cast a parsing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel Master, you and Wendy." Verwood tempted and said: "Nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? No, nothing." Siegel’s eyes are still focused on the dust. There is no jitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Wendy has become a teacher. She came to Sigel in the first place. "I have a part of the elves' pedigree. Although it is not as long-lived as a half-elf, it must be longer than Janet's life and can maintain a longer youth." She said bluntly: "I am waiting for you, you only Need to tell me that after Janet is me, that's okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel doesn't know what expression he was at the time, just remember that he is very clear Refused her. Then Wendy cried out, then she took out her wand. The Guardian of the Department of Protection is not an opponent of Siegel at all in terms of offense. Direct manipulation of elements is more like a means of cheating. After only four rounds, Siegel has already held the victory in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't wait for me, wasting time and youth, even if you have some elf's blood, you shouldn't spend your time." Siegel holding a wand, right Wendy said: "Congratulations on becoming a teacher, but I am sorry that I can't give you any promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty sighed and sighed from the ground Wand. She wiped her eyes with her sleeves and raised her head to say to Siegel: "Can you turn the fire into ice and turn the rock into air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I can do this through elemental transformation." Siegel nodded. "The element is not one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, I can give birth to flames from the ice. Find the soil from the air." Wendy interrupted him. And after I finished speaking, I turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, in the council, Wendy no longer deliberately sings against Siegel, apparently no longer entangled or obsessed with him. This kind of calm made the other faction chiefs somewhat uncomfortable, so I encouraged Weywood to ask the situation. He whispered to Wendy and now to Siegel. Both of them have no obvious emotional fluctuations, as if things have come to an end,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if The Federation also has a enchantment (mind control) wizard, only they can use the subtle expression of the face to see through the heart and find the truth of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a touch of embarrassment, it does not affect the efficiency of the Federation. After testing by the Master of Change, I finally found a substance that can prevent the effects of different dust: lead. This alchemy material can effectively block the energy fluctuations emitted by the dust, avoiding their damage to the living body and the ability to expand further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the plastic energy system was led by Simonton, a three-tiered chin, finally came the good news. They found a way to copy the dust, which played a key role in studying how to protect this energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different dust is also found in the wall of the mine wall, mostly hidden in the depths of the rocky land, rarely exposed to the sun. They are often mistaken for the dust of some glowing gemstones. After seeing the dust, Simonton recalled that he had seen something similar, so he went to the bottom of the storage bag. They found a substance similar to dust from several green shale rocks, and then gradually grasped some of the properties of the dust by pushing back the formation of the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of the plastic energy system, together with the lead protection method provided by the Department of Change, allows the Masters of the Protection Department to study spells in a targeted manner. The first version of the anti-dust shield is quite difficult to cast, and it is similar to the transfer technique, which is difficult for the common mage to master. And when you cast the spell, you need to consume about 500 gold coins and a plum bar, so it is far from the practical stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the existence of the secret nuclear can greatly reduce the cost of improving the spell. Using advanced creation and almost inexhaustible elemental energy, the protective mage experimented day and night. After one month, the anti-dust shield effect is improved, the spell is simplified, the cost is reduced, and the difficulty of casting is similar to that of the fireball, which can be basically used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first beneficiary of this spell is the dwarf saint. Every day, the wizard of the federation will display this shield for him, slowing him down by the influence of the goblin. As a result, the frequency at which the saints consume their power to “renew” themselves is greatly reduced, and the wall channel can last longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the premise of this is that the goblin no longer continues to increase the intensity of the attack on the grain wall barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the power of the rules can destroy the crystal wall passages, and their bombs obviously cannot reach this level, but the dwarf saints have a grain wall barrier that is not like a passage. Sturdy. Since the launch of the dust bomb, the frequency of the explosion has become lower and lower, but the intensity has become higher and higher, and it is getting closer to the limit of the rule wall made by the saints. At present, as long as the saints remain healthy, the weapons of the goblin will not affect the channel side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf may trust his saints wholeheartedly, and the Master may never have this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the barrier is finished, Mora’s cockroaches will bear the brunt, and then it will be Heim’s collar, so Siegel has been thinking about how to avoid going to that desperate situation. At the opposite end of the crystal wall channel of Mora is a death Jedi. Siegel tried to pass five times, but at most it can only last for one minute. The projection avatar exhausted the spell ability and “dead” back to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can use the secret to pass the nuclear, I can certainly hold it, but the energy that it escapes cannot penetrate the barrier of the crystal wall, and that thing There are thirty tons, so you can't carry it with you.” Siegel said to the Security Council: “The avatars generated by the projection of the astral world can't use the shadows to hide in the shadows. Similarly, flashes and other spells also arise. It doesn't work. Maybe if you are in the past, hiding in the shadows may be the solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't let you take this risk, Siegel* * Your teacher, it is absolutely not allowed to go to the real body. No Master can do this." Wendy severed, and other Masters nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and he knew the risks, not desperate and would not choose to do that. “Extremely high temperatures and high-intensity dust are insurmountable obstacles, and the goblins are sure to look at this exit. So the question now is, do we want to activate the passages in the northern part of the Walled Mountains?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Federation, only fifteen people in the Security Council know the existence of the Northern Passage. Using the wizard's spells and learning from the dwarf's runes, the association's "drills" and other methods, the Federation secretly opened this passage. Today, the board of directors will decide whether to complete it or not, and whether it will complete the construction of the "last foot". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tough decision. There is a dwarf saint in the Mora, and the channel of the starry kingdom is said to have a sacred sage. Both can use the power to shield the passage in times of crisis. The federation has its own methods, but it is certainly not as strong as the saints in terms of strength, so everyone is hesitant and no one dares to make up their minds immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the plastics department of Simonton also died down and closed his mouth. Everyone, look at me, I look at you, the whole venue has become a communication between the eyes. This situation is a bit funny, Siegel did not hold back for a moment, his mouth curled up. Then this smile spread, brewed, and fermented among the people. In the end, everyone brought a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
