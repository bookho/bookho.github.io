			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that stupidity has no limits. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky, without a cloud, the sand land will soon be heated by the hot sun in the early autumn. Fortunately, the temperature is not as uncomfortable as it was a month ago, and the knights in armor are not cooked like the chickens in the stove. Siegel never liked various lengthy rituals. He simply said a few words. I hope that everyone will pay tribute to the god of war with fair contest and superb martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then sat under the pergola and watched the riding competition with Janet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The galloping horse is always full of blood, beautiful knights and cloaks dancing with the wind are attracting everyone's attention. Considering that the sooner the game is ended, the troubles caused by the smell of horse dung will be ended as soon as possible, and the riding competition will be placed at the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who do you think will win?" Janet asked: "Do you have any professional advice, I will choose a few to bet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also participated in the gambling of the gram?" Siegel smiled twice, this time he was in a good mood, cool red wine and fresh fruit, The cool breeze is accompanied by blood and beauty. This kind of relaxation is very helpful for him to participate in the sword game. "Janet, I don't know much about riding a horse. I spend most of my time using the enchanted magical summons, or the gods who are smarter than me. Kerry always sends me horses, but you See if I have been riding a few times, aren’t they all assigned to the knights? You have to ask Mana for this situation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is also in the pergola She decided to personally defend the safety of Siegel. This is an uncertain factor - for Siegel who wants to sneak into the game. "Mana, there is earth element guard under my feet to prevent someone from dig deep underground; my head has large gas elements to monitor the air; all kinds of magic protection around me, including space locks and time traps. I think I am moving. Magic Tower, do you really think I need protection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the knight's duty, not related to your strength." Mana answered with seriousness. Before the mistakes made by the Cavaliers, she still remembered it. Now I want to set an example for everyone. A mercenary-born man is now the most loyal and self-disciplined knight of Heim, and she has sacrificed unimaginable sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, but can you sit down? This doesn't affect the Knights' rules." Siegel changed a stool. Not far from the side: "You stand in the middle of it and affect me to watch the game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded, sat down, then Stiffly twisting around the body to observe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The racecourse is the most popular entertainment venue for Heim, except for some houses with red lanterns. It's half a mile long, and it takes more than a thousand steps to run around. The ground is covered with fine, heavy sand that won't be easily blown up by the wind, but it can also act as a buffer. Usually, the place where the knights show riding, training horses and people gambling horses is always bustling and lively. It is now crowded. Thousands of different flags flutter around the stadium, and various family crests are displayed in the wind. Those who have been eliminated in the first round must take down their own flags, and those who determine the rankings in the future will have their own badges placed in specific places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, riding a big horse!" Isaac changed his former mischievous look and sat next to Siegel. The lively scene and the honey lollipop in the hands played a good role. He is learning very fast, and has been able to accurately express his own meaning, with a hint of less lord. He finally liked the sword. When Siegel came out of the magic lab, he chased the father's gift for the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and agreed. Instead of using magic, he completely cut a wooden sword by hand. Then made a small round shield. The metal helmet is too heavy, and a pair of crocodile leather hats is enough for Isaac to be excited for a long time. As for the armor on his body, Siegel made a small secret silver shirt with love. Lightweight, flexible, and a real armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every ring of Mithril is made by him, just like he made it for himself in the grocery store of Dwarf Dingbao The first armor is the same. If you look closely with a magnifying glass, you can also find some very fine patterns on the rings. Everyone should be a precious toy, but Siegel doesn't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ride a dragon and become a dragon knight!" Isaac has a bigger appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have already rode, child. The dragon is not comfortable to ride." Siegel looked around, and Capricorn was lucky not to be here. The strength of the dragon girl has advanced by leaps and bounds, but she is still overtaken by Siegel, which makes her very unhappy. And as her body grows, hunger becomes stronger. The fresh flesh wrapped in the metal has become particularly attractive to her, and she just made her mouth drool when she thought about it. Siegel finally understood why the dragon likes to eat the full body knight. It's like the same thing that humans invented sandwiches – metal and flesh sandwiches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn decided to take a break from St. Joseph’s time and wait until the end of the contest. Having said that, she never left, and kept herself in the bedroom all day, and she didn’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on the podium, there is the best view here, and you can stay away from the messy and hustle and bustle of the audience. The contestants gathered around the rostrum and their support team. Only the opposite is the ordinary seat, there are hawkers selling all kinds of food. Figs, jujube, melon and kebab, as well as a cool ale that is never lacking. In order to prevent people from getting drunk, all ale must be mixed with water, but the price can not exceed one can of copper. This has neither profit nor blockage of the toilet, so some smart people think of the idea and sell juice drinks in the venue, which is really popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to eat something else, my stomach is a little hungry." Isaac shook the sugar in his hand and shouted: "Or ask them to fight!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be patient, even though it’s a bit difficult for you at this age, you need patience to become a dragon knight.” Siegel touches Isaac’s Above the head, he said: "Without patience, it will become the food of the dragon, not the knight. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course a fairy tale and a knight There will be a "famous aphorism". The real situation is that if there is no strong spell protection, or direct intervention by divine power, the dragon is impossible to ride. It is never a human strength to want to be patient with a dragon that is nearly infinite. Human beings are short-sighted, radical and impulsive, and although they learn quickly, they always forget their lessons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game took several rounds. A knight came to the rostrum from the preparation area and shouted loudly: "Count of Siegel, I want to launch a knight fight for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound Shouting naturally caught the attention of Siegel, who moved his eyes away. I saw the young man surrounded by his own guard. From the lion's coat of arms on his armor and helmet, it's not hard to guess that he is Witt Griffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark brown hair is enough to make many girls like the handsome face and strong eyes. He is like a fighter who challenges the giants and a brave man standing in front of the dragon. It is not a good thing to describe yourself as an evil leader in drama, but only in this way can you show the difference in strength between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witt has taken off one of his own gloves. Throw in front of Siegel. Isaac is unclear, so he wants to reach out and help him pick it up. It is estimated that he will return it to him and tell him not to throw things. Siegel mentioned his son and put him in his seat. He said softly: "This is a duel invitation, not for you, you can't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mana let the guards surround Wit and warn around. This will not be another move to divert attention, she can not eliminate this concern. What the knights are doing. Want to use this stupid way to get the attention of the Lord's adult? Heim's new rise of the Master and the Master of the Craftsman class is only a trend. It has not yet been able to influence the Cavaliers. Why bother the lord's unhappiness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the identity of the other party has been guessed, Siegel still asks: "Which name is your name, which family, what is the identity and what? Reasons to ask me for a duel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witt Griffin, from the Star Kingdom, the Lions, the son of Orson, the Royal Knight and the Battlefield Baron." With a high head, look straight at the condescending Siegel. "You cast evil spells. The old Griffin family can no longer speak, and throws a nobleman into the quagmire, insulting the honor of the Griffin family. To this end, I ask you for a duel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what the teacher represents?" Siegel was not as angry as he was a few days ago - it was only for him. Not for Janet, so he can still speak calmly: "Do you think you really have a chance of winning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
