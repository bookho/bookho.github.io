			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to have no one, Siegel believes in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental surge never has the effect of dispelling the body, and the elf has always wanted to avoid the escape of the Masters Federation, so it has set a lot of defense and sent people. Day and night surveillance. And the most important point: even if the situation of the battle is fierce, isn't there a survivor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the wreckage of the Three Peaks Tower and walked to the rest area. In addition to the ** division, other casters and apprentices live there everyday. There are bedrooms, restaurants, study rooms and living rooms, which are the most bustling places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a garden outside the building, with green grass and colorful flowers surrounding the central maple. This tree was planted at the time of the establishment of the Mage Federation. It has a history of more than 100 years and the trees are very strong. In the autumn, it will be a fiery piece, and the scenery is very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel turned the corner, the maple tree was still there, but there was no garden. Instead, they are graves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave is very simple. A low wooden bag is preceded by a wooden sign. The name of the deceased is written in the dragon language, and the mage emblem is engraved with a knife. The soil in the grave is mixed with the plants in the original garden. The grass, leaves and flowers are all together, like a beautiful quilt for the deceased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the cemetery, Siegel saw the only thing in the entire Federation: the Iron Golem of Lion King Alexander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Golem is a magical immune structure, the internal structure is self-contained, and no external force is required, so Siegel thinks it may be able to survive the element. The invasion of the surge. However, after that, the Iron Golem was bound to have a hard battle. Its steel body was full of scars. One leg was missing from the knees, and the shoulders and head were also flattened and twisted and twisted on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there are some clues from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel walked over, and the eyes of the Iron Golem stared at him. Then, a burst of green smoke spouted from behind the body of the demon, spreading with an acidic smell. Siegel stepped back two steps and fanned the wind with his hand. Under his astonished gaze. The steel plate on the chest of the Iron Golem opens to both sides, revealing the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King Alexander is blood, lying weakly in the Iron Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lion!" Siegel rushed forward and handed the healing potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander took the potion with his trembling hands. Drink it up and throw the bottle away. Siegel found that his hands were very hot, as if they were steamed, and the body was also. The wound in the chest and abdomen has been infected and gives off a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be unsuccessful." Alexander laughed and laughed at himself: "Therapeutic magic has no effect at all. This body is finished."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will send it back to the city of Mire, where there is a magical pastor, maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lion King raised his hand and interrupted Siegel’s words. He looks very weak, but there is still a horrible momentum between his eyes. He looked at Siegel, staring at the defensive staff in his hand, and then asked, "Are you joining the Masters Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander nodded, struggling to hold himself up and sit in front of Siegel. The blood flowing out of the wound is no longer blood, but gray-green pus and repressed **. Although his movements are slow and clumsy. Can still not see Siegel touch him. It's as if his body is more fragile than the thin ice of spring, and it will be destroyed by touch or body heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The association has a lot of good things, but it is really not a good thing." Alexander sweated, but the sweat was quickly evaporated by the heat. "First throw the defensive staff aside, let me tell you a story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment and then threw the staff far away Far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be optimistic, I don't want to let the Sanfeng Pagoda happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander blinked and the spell passed through layers of protection. Successfully entered Siegel's mind, all protective spells did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ability of the ** division? Never heard of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to use magic to protect himself, and he received the message from Alexander's finger. It was a battle scene replayed from the perspective of the Lion King, telling everything that happened after he returned to the Three Peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the finger left Siegel’s forehead and was unable to let go. He closed his eyes. Take a break while waiting for Siegel to watch the memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full ten minutes, Siegel came back. Not only did he see it, he also experienced everything that Alexander had experienced after returning to Deepwater. How does he empty the mana pool, how to transfer the important assets of the Masters Federation, and how to fight with the sergeant Caspar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only part of the duel process has no results, and nothing happens when the elemental surge hits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who can't pass it on to you." Alexander closed his eyes and said weakly: "Your mind will think that the pain in it is true. Causes your body to collapse, just like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Casper dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lion nodded and pointed to one of the tombstones: "He is buried there. Although he is an enemy, he is also a member of the federation and is qualified to be buried there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you have a lot of questions to ask, but the rest of my time is much shorter than you, so I will ask first." Alexander's eyes slammed open and whispered with a hoarse voice. Q: "Are you causing all this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siglton was in the same place and nodded after a while. "I set up a strategy for the elves and Knox to fight together. I reported to the Masters Association the relationship between the Association and Nexus. I also blocked the orc reinforcements that Caspar recruited. I arranged for the grassland tribe to attack Deepwater City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander looked at Siegel with a bright gaze, staring at him, the atmosphere became abnormal tension. According to Alexander's memory, the Mage Federation of the Three Peaks Tower has only two living people beside the cemetery, and half of them are buried in the tomb. As for the few in the underground library of Heim, even Siegel does not know whether they belong to the Federation or the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, you didn't lie, you are very gutsy." The lion suddenly smiled, even though he smiled and coughed up blood. “Although your actions have intensified the loss of the Masters Federation, which has led to the current situation, it is enough that you can become a winner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wipes Go to the mouth of the blood, and say to Siegel: "If it is not you. The Masters Association will take possession of all the fruits of victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you still Living, the Mage Federation has no failure.” Siegel said: “How can I cure your injuries? I can use teleportation to take you where you need it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Useless, this is Caspar's ability. His usage makes me believe that one thing is the end of life. My body believes this. So even the wounds are too lazy to treat, just like this Waiting for death. But he is also uncomfortable. I have assimilated all the spells and burned them by the burning hands. The two sorcerers are all gone. Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander smiled so that Siegel was very uncomfortable, he was a little overwhelmed. "Can the magic of the ** division be lifted? If it is placed in a place where the magic spell cannot take effect, can it be suppressed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of the holy land of the Jackdaw tribe . If the magical land can suppress the operation of the Casper spell, is there a chance to treat Alexander? Maybe he can't leave the Holy Land for a lifetime, but at least he has hope for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion shook his head, and the fluffy blonde swayed like a lion. "You didn't become a sergeant, you don't know the characteristics of abilities. All abilities are instantaneous, like a flash, and then leave no trace. Casper's spells have taken effect. And immediately, there will be no suppression, Opportunities to disperse and modify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
