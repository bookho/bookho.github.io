			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome finally got rid of the paralysis that lightning brought him, and he resisted the sting and re-observed the situation. There are blurry colors everywhere in the field of vision, and he knows that his eyes are not hurt. Unfortunately, in order to enter Macabu, all the magical equipment of the gnome was not brought around, even the healing potions. He has been mad by the injury just now, and now only wants to take revenge as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he can only see the shadow of his opponent, he decided to attack with a fireball, but even a simple judgment of distance is difficult for him. So he uses the soul connection to call the magic pet's line of sight, at least from another angle to see the battlefield situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he saw a warhammer getting bigger and bigger in the field of vision, and then the sudden darkness and the pain of cracking the skull. The death of the magic pet is like tearing off part of the wizard's soul, causing the gnome to be unable to concentrate on keeping the spell in his hand. The fire element fled in front of him, once again causing burns to his fragile face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What other spells can I use? The gnome brain turned fast. Another feather shot came, and the stupid woman who was persevering was still not dead, and the spells of the protective arrows could not continue. It seems that everything began to break away from the mastery of the gnomes, and he did not expect that he would encounter another human wizard in Macabu. In this operation, is the Mage Federation still equipped with dark lines that have not been discovered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of his distraction, Siegel threw the warhammer out. The attack should be continuous and change as much as possible so that the opponent can't catch the rhythm. This is the teaching of the dwarf Elinette, although he does not know what is a spell battle, but the experience summed up from the life and death struggle is not wrong. The spell of the protection of the long-range weapon can't keep up with the consumption of the continuous attack, and it will die at the end of the hammer. The gnome's belly was hit by a hammer, and he curled up and rolled back with the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Siegel caught up, the gnome managed to remove the warhammer from his chest and push him aside. He saw a blurred figure coming to the front, with a fluttering cloak behind him. The gnome is strong in spirit, squeezing all the magical energy from the body, and calling for the fire element to come, ready to use the burning hand with the last power. This is the second Knox Brotherhood Mage to attack Siegel with a burning hand. This unusual situation makes the squid who also knows this magic spell curious. Maybe they have improved this spell, which is more powerful and harder to guard against? As he thought about it, he stepped on the gnome's right hand. When the two palms cannot be merged, this spell can't be displayed. Siegel knew this when he first was at the Kokou camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the fluctuation of the fire element continues, and the casting process is not completely interrupted. Siegel quickly squatted down and used his knuckles as a sword, quickly and fiercely pricking in the gnome throat and eye sockets. The syllable of the curse came to an abrupt end, and it was with silence that was already incomplete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel repeatedly checked several times to make sure that the gnome was indeed dead, and that he stood up. The raven landed on his shoulder and called for two sounds. Its abdomen and tail have lost a lot of feathers, and it has no longer been elegant. Siegel took the raven and scrutinized its wounds. He found that the tight scales under the feathers prevented the hound from further attacking, even the sharp claws and canines could not penetrate this layer of protection. Going back to Deepwater City, you must check what the scales are all about. Siegel reminds himself that he has never heard of similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a small group of orc warriors marched in a neat queue, a total of ten people, dressed in exquisite breastplates, holding long hook knives, carrying them with them Flying axe and machete. The three-eye pattern on the breastplate with red waterproof paint marks their identity as a sharp guard. Because the Raven Baron wrestled with the hound dog and did not patrol the sky, the orcs were brought close to the battlefield through the darkness around them. When Siegel raised the raven to look at the wound, they stopped at ten steps away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The orc stunned, and the leading captain raised his fist by the forehead and waved to the right. The orcs behind them stopped as fast as a neat machine and separated into two sides to form a conical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also stunned. He was too concerned about the battle with the gnomes and the injury of the darling. As a result, he ignored the control of the battlefield. Looking at the axe of the group of orcs, there are four fighters in each warrior. I believe that they can throw them all in five seconds with their throwing speed. Master's ability is strong, and unless it can be transmitted instantly, it is impossible to survive this attack. Even if you use a protective spell to attenuate the damage, it can still cause limb damage, making it impossible to use the next spell. Siegel couldn't think of a way at the moment, but he was still straight and bravely facing the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the orcs all squatted on one knee and bowed down to Siegel, shouting: "Rock Tower!" In the orc language, this means victory, and is often used as a tribute or trench. The orc's elite attitude made the Master short-lived, and then he tried to think about the meaning behind it, until he remembered his embarrassing form. ‘Death Knight, the orc must have treated me as a death knight. 'Siegel thought, 'This shows that the death knight riding a dragon is likely to be an alliance with the orcs and even have a higher leadership position. Attacking the Jackdaw tribe at the Harvest Festival is not an isolated incident, but clears the way for the orc attack. Perhaps the strategy and conspiracy are deeper, after all, there is a lack of things on the grassland that can make the dragon interested. ‘<< /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the undead form, Siegel can abandon the influence of feelings on thinking, so you can think more quickly and connect several things in a relationship. He immediately thought of the deep water city, whether it is the masked lord's parliament or the wizard's federation, all have huge wealth and rare resources, only these can impress the dragon. But why does the dragon cooperate with the undead, and what is hidden in it? Originally Siegel believed that riding a dragon was only an isolated incident, but from the reaction of the orcs, there should be more than one death knight, so who is organizing them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc captain looked up and looked at the standing cockroach. These undead monsters have powerful power and are eccentric, and don't know when to cast death spells. His former captain was killed by a bunch of purple-black rays because he was drinking bone soup in front of the death knight - this is the food of the day. Although he took over as the new captain, he also understood that the punishment from these dead spirits was sometimes faster and more embarrassing than the three-eyed warlord Lund. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s sweat in his forehead, even if he was unarmed and faced with a mountain giant who was not convinced of discipline, he was not so nervous. The death knight was carrying a crow in his hand (the orc was wrong) and looked bigger than the average crow. He thinks of the spell light that broke out here, guessing that this crow might be a pet of a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the owner of the magic pet? He saw the gnome at this time, was burnt by fire, penetrated by lightning, smashed his stomach by heavy objects, and pricked his eyes and throat by sharp weapons. The orc captain swallowed a spurt and felt that he had encountered a very tyrannical death knight - this damn bad luck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came back and saw that the orc captain stared at Barron and looked very curious. He analyzed the other party's thoughts, and made a move to the magic pet to give orders. Then he pinched the raven's neck and pretended to force it. Barron had a very good "噶~" sound, spit out a small tongue and lowered his head, pretending to be pinched to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Siegel raised his arm and pointed his way, as long as it was away from the port. He remembered to say more wrong things, but casually said in an unquestionable tone: "Hey!" I don't know why, the orc captain felt that his understanding of the moment was beyond ordinary people, nodded and answered: "Swobu!" "Following") Then he led the team to stand up immediately and ran neatly in the direction chosen by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not in the form of sputum, Siegel will wipe the sweat from the forehead, take a long sigh of relief, and then calm down the excitement of death. . After confirming that the orc's elite footsteps gradually moved away, Siegel returned to normal and then turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak, who was hiding on the ground, and Mana, who was hiding behind the box, also had the same feeling of restlessness. In particular, Mana, she was glad that she had refused the "goodwill" of the Knox Association and chose to help Fazak. Otherwise, she must be the same as the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the cloak made her completely invisible, but the female shooter had a crush on him since he bought her with a dragon tooth dagger. This kind of affection affected her judgment. Even Siegel’s sudden move in the morning was misinterpreted. Mana thought that the Master had already discovered the conspiracy of the Knox Brotherhood. Although this idea is not far from the truth, she mistakenly thought that her "sneaky behavior" had long been known. ‘This is why he arranged for me behind the temple’. Mana’s thinking is getting worse and worse. ‘He is testing me to see if I can bring order out of chaos. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mage Master.” Mana immediately kneeled down on one knee, placing the longbow in front of her, and lowered her head, her hands and feet soft. In order to disguise herself as a man, she cut into a messy short hair. Although the color of the pale gold is still very beautiful, it is now shaking like a straw in the wind. Just as the knight loyal to the lord, or the mercenary swore to their head, Mana tried to control the tone so as not to interrupt the sentence: "I will dedicate my long bow and skills to you, obey your orders, only Ask for your asylum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
