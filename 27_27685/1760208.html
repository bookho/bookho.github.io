			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp was completely chaotic and seemed to be enemies everywhere. Fear is more hurtful than a sword, and the Baron Brown stands next to Siegel, watching him continue to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licks his chin and finally understands the role of the Master in the real. If the family had a mage in the starry kingdom, it would not lose the main force in the war, resulting in a lack of support, and only to find a chance to re-emerge in the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Warrior God is good, but it can only strengthen the soldier's melee ability and heal after the injury. There are no fireballs, no lightning, no stupid dogs everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball is much more powerful than the trebuchet and is very accurate. As long as you see an enemy gathering, you can release it far away. When the southern coalition was attacked by a fireball, the scene made Brown's heart pump out. But standing on the side of the fireball releaser, watching it shine in the enemy's dazzling fire, that feeling is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana commanded the cavalry, constantly interspersed in the enemy line, not asking for much damage every time, but to drive the enemy as much as possible, causing confusion. The dwarf Elinette, with his people, marched around the highlands in the form of elite squads, fighting the soldiers who tried to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc's troops were released by Siegel, and their orders were simple: live, grab horses. With their sensitive sense of smell, they can quickly find the stables as long as the people of the Brown family point in a general direction. The half-orcs do not need to use firearms. The ability of dark vision makes them more suitable for night battles than the southern coalition forces. They rushed into the stables, and the disobedient horses were hacked to death with an axe, and the obedient and obedient ones took it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many good war horses only obey the orders of their masters, and now they are in a pool of blood. The violent factors in the blood of the half-orcs were triggered and the combat power went up to a higher level. Many people shouted the lord long lived, with a long string of horses behind him, rampaging in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is casting a large spell, using the temporary runestone as a node to construct the battlefield magic array. If some of the sergeants use it, they can release the fireball or lower the acid rain. However, Siegel can only control relatively simple spells in this way. For example, silent phantoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to create scenes of tragic deaths of human soldiers and increases the number of dead bodies on the ground. Just like a lie, if you repeat it many times, you may be treated as the truth. The number of casualties in the Southern Allied Forces was exaggerated in this way, and the soldiers who fled were one by one. With rumors, with fear, with the morale of collapse, a chain reaction was formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has failed, really fast." Brown Baron looked at the defeated Southern Alliance. Only the flags of the three families are still flying, barely supporting in the chaos. Many soldiers fled and rushed to gather under those flags. They saw the situation is not good, wrapped in a broken army along the ore avenue to escape south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles lost their helmets, but the status of the peasant soldiers was much better. Since they are self-sufficient weapons, this equipment is their entire property. Participating in the battle is to get extra income, but you can't lose your money. They have been wearing light armor to sleep, so they can be armed to escape. Therefore, these people still have a certain combat power, and they occupy the advantage of the number. It is urgent that they may cause unexpected events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp also has many places that are still resisting. Some knights formed battles and fought against the chaotic allies who were mad at the camp. They shouted and supported each other. Siegel ordered Manna to blow the horn and assemble the team. These warriors who are still insisting do not need to be hard-hitting with them, and they will appear too inefficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Baron came to Sigel and congratulated him in advance and asked: "What plans do you have next?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the ore boulevard." Siegel said: "Would you like to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chasing the battle "Is this not good?" Brown Baron frowned. "After this battle, you can already be among the great aristocrats in the southern part of the New World. Some small lords will go to you. So it would be better to show mercy at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment, then said: "You have some truth, but since they dare to come to my territory, they should pay the price. It is easy. Go It can't be that easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a nobleman who asks for a prisoner's treatment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the Baron Brown and said: "Wasting time. The mining workforce still has some value. Stay What does the nobles do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded, she was always very loyal and meticulous in executing Siegel’s orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Baron will naturally not stop this order, and those aristocrats who are closely related to him will receive a message at the same time as the battle begins, and honestly hide in the corner of the camp. , avoiding the chaotic scene. Other nobles are dead. Live Baron is not in the heart. The ransom looks good, but it is not as good as the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it carefully and said: "Baron Siegel, there is a sinister request. I don't know if you can ask the wizard's mage. I would be honored to be able to ask one or two as consultants for the Territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a resident magistrate, I am afraid that your current territory is not very attractive. But if you invite the caster to cast spells for you, then you can discuss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, if you ask for a day of fireball on the battlefield, about cost How much?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“One day?” Siegel shook his head: “The Masters Federation had a guide, or used it for internal mages, about asking other mages to assist In a safe laboratory, if someone asks me to cast a fireball, the fee set by the association is two hundred gold coins. Considering the danger of the battlefield and the delay of going back and forth, you need to prepare three hundred fireballs for you. Fifty or so gold coins are possible. Of course, The larger the number, the time is relatively concentrated, the price can drop some of the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Brown Baron smile or two, refuses to talk about this topic. He suddenly felt that the charges of the Warrior's God Priest were not too far off the mark. It is no wonder that the Southern Allied Forces will fail. If they can move six Masters, one of them will continue to cast spells. He calculated it in his heart. After a whole day, every spell was counted as a fireball. The number of gold coins - the result made him scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Baron, your soldiers chasing the enemies on the Ore Avenue, don't know what these people in the camp do?" Brown Baron said: "It's better to give it to me." Soldiers, see if they have the intention to surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel understood his intentions and said: "All the spoils. You can take half of it. As for the knights..." The mage thought for a moment: "I only need craftsmen, all craftsmen, ordinary farmers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete. You are a Very generous lord," said the Baron Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't rush to praise me, there is one thing I need to tell you." The Master looked serious. Staring at Brown's eyes: "Your brother Patrick, who is in contact with Knox's mage, has been cast a spell that affects his mind. He is thinking of a plan to attack the catapult camp and also set up for my enemies. The trap, the intention to kill me. This is not his intention. I will not be like him. Just make sure that he is completely free from the spell, you can leave the city of Mire. You can always send people, whether it is a servant or Guard, everything is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the effect is good, "A month or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very cautious, but I understand this." Sir Brown said: "I hope my brother can get the best." Care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown stretched out, I moved my muscles and patted my cheek. Finally, instead of playing the clown among the southern lords, he changed back to the self-confident, courageous, young and promising lord. Although compared with Siegel, he is slightly inferior. But after understanding what he lacks, he believes he can catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What organization is Knox Association? It seems that Siegel is a hostile relationship. They are too dangerous, although they may be very powerful, but don't touch them better. The Masters Federation is in Sham Shui Po. It may be better to consult the Master. Even if there is no Master, it is good to make some apprentices and cultivate good relationships. No wonder Deepwater City can become the largest city in the New World, knowing that a group of businessmen can't have such a big skill. It turned out to be the credit of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
