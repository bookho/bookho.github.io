Siegel looked at Janet's body and said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked several times, did not find any wounds from his wife, and did not even have a hole in the size of acupuncture. And there is no poison or disease, she is as calm and peaceful as a sleeping person, but she can't wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has a theory, or the greatest hope in his heart: the reincarnation ceremony is completed, and Janet left the original body in that moment. Reshape the blood. So her body is indeed dead, but she should still be somewhere, living in a certain shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest evidence is Janet’s current body... The state of the body: She is still a human being and has not changed back to the demon. If it is a general death, all the deformation effects will be lifted, and she should not be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that Janet’s hope of still alive is very embarrassing. The scene of the reincarnation ceremony was being killed, and even the half-elf wizard Idis was caught off guard, and he could only escape. If Janet reincarnate in that situation, can she be spared? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black man, sudden appearance, serpentine dagger, ability to pierce the magic shield and the effect of the Holy Spirit, Siegel firmly remember these characteristics. He sat motionless on the edge of the bed, guarding Janet, and pressing on his inner anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something else in the room, and the magical energy around him became turbulent because of his mood, raging on walls, furniture, and accessories. Copper mirrors and silver plates all melt at high temperatures, red wine freezes in glass bottles, lightning jumps on the roof and burns a black mark, but it does not cause a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the violent fluctuations in magical energy, illusions continue to appear in the air, and even in some places, tiny elemental creatures are summoned. Their lives are very short-lived and fragile, and they usually dissipate after a few jumps. There was a constant explosion of sound coming out of the room and mixing with the thunderstorm. Everyone in the city of Mire is trembled, far from the room of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Mana dared to ring the door of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel slammed his fists and the elements in the room were quiet. The door has been burned by acid. It was dropped from the door frame by Mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The troops are gathering, and all the knights have begun to mobilize." Mana was soaked all over her body, water was dripping on her armor, and she was smashed on the ground. . She rubbed her face. But the brows of the wrinkles: "According to your order, the whole Heim can gather a total of 3,000 soldiers, plus about 1,500 logisticians. But in this way, all the men in the territory are basically They are all in the army..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the movement of the elf?" Siegel asked in a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scout has been sent, but has not returned yet. So the intelligence is still the one before: the elf has no action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana sees Siegel's eyes covered with bloodshot eyes, her lips are chapped, and her skin is tarnished. When he was talking, he still caught Janet's hand. Even though the little hand has become cold, it seems to be a huge attraction for the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to cry, but also with awkward hatred, but also with annoyance. I remember that Siegel had just said during the day that he could not make a decisive battle with the elves in the wild, but now he has issued all the orders for mobilization. It is a very dangerous sign to use the anger, and the god of warriors can hardly lower their well-being in this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is about to persuade. Seeing that Siegel stood up, the hands of countless spells on the battlefield shivered, and flashed several times in a row, failing to complete a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel grabbed the wooden bench just sitting underneath and slammed it into pieces on the ground. He patted his hands hard, then patted his face and re-read the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blue-gray glow shrouded Janet and slowly infiltrated. Siegel seems to have been pumped away again, his shoulders swaying, and his feet are awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our goal is the Elven Forest, which means to break through the elves of the siege of the Fort, and then continue north." Siegel said: "The number is four thousand five hundred, enough."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet bit his lip and persuaded: "The Lord Lord. You can't send troops. This expedition will destroy the Heim collar and ruin it all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said coldly: "I can take you through the walls of the city, go to the Black Blood Castle and the Orcs, and you will be able to take you to the Elven Forest. The elf army is no more than four thousand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a question of numbers!" Mana suddenly said: "Take all the soldiers, secret What about the city? Who will defend the attack of the elves? When the elves occupy this place, who else can fight with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel spreads his left hand A red ball of light came out of the palm of your hand. The light ball seems to have life, and it pulsates with the rhythm of the heartbeat. Mana doesn't know magic, but just looks, she feels that the ball of light is very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I let the army move forward, no one will step back, no one will raise this idea." Siegel smashed, will Knox The magic of the syndicate is dissolved. There are many uses for controlling emotional influence behavior. Under the powerful spell, the most common human beings can be as powerful as the Berserker. Knox's research has many directions. Before Siegel didn't want to use it, it didn't mean he didn't have these means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using the power of magic to advance the army?" Mana blurted out: "Just for Janet, don't you even have morality and honor?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can't stand it anymore. "I am your lord!" he said as he pressed his arm against Manna's neck and slammed her into the wall. The black flame condensed dagger pointed at her eyes, and the pale golden hair of the forehead sizzled and gave a scorching smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My request has never been much, just want to learn magic, help others when they are capable, explore and see the world when they are free. Mystery. Again and again, I can’t achieve these wishes!” Siegel gasped and said angrily: “The danger is added to me, it’s just a test of fate, but why Looking for Janet? Why? She was innocently involved in the conspiracy. Was forced to use only death to escape the curse, but even this opportunity is not given to her? Elf, black killer, elf, black killer, I will not put !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana's throat was smothered. She couldn't breathe at all, but she didn't resist and struggle, just leaving tears. A drop of tears dripped onto the black inflammation dagger and instantly turned into steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel loosened his hand a little, and Mana could finally speak. "Destiny is unfair to her. Is it fair to others? Is it fair to those soldiers who are assembled outside? For me..." She closed her eyes and leaned back against the wall, saying to Siegel. "If you don't want to stab me, use that magic first on me. At least I don't have to worry about it anymore. I only know how to move forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You don't know magic." Siegel gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to know magic!" said Mana. "Look at yourself, Siegel, I don't need to know magic."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel loosened his hand and the flame dagger disappeared. He said to Mana: "According to my orders, assemble troops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stubbornly pushed the horsewoman away. Go back to Janet. She was still lying quietly in bed, saying nothing. Maybe she won't say anything more, maybe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at yourself, Siegel’s mind rang what Mana had just said. The original bedroom had a mirror, but he could only find a mass of molten silver, just like a pile of wax. He picked up the silver block, recited the spell of the restoration, re-flatified it, and saw what he was like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissipated hair, red eyes. Pale and dry lips, twisted faces. He wants to laugh at himself, but finds his smile is strange and dangerous, and there is a crazy look everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Marcabu, the crazy gnome mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great rain. Thunder thundered, but the sound of the army gathered from the window of the castle could still be heard. The Quartermaster is sending weapons and armor to the queued soldiers, and everyone is trying to dress neatly under the illumination of the lanterns. Many people still don't know why they are gathering on this black rainy night, and they don't know where to go. But they trust their lords and believe that he can always bring victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
