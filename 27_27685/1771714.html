			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigelmana and the surviving knights rode through the setting sun and the twilight, riding into the dark night. Www. (The best experience of novel reading is in []] The snow in the sky has not stopped, helping them to cover the footprints behind them. The clouds in the sky are dark and thick, and the stars and the moon are completely invisible, but the white snow in the mountains seems to be able to shine, allowing them to barely see the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mounts are nearing the limit and they may be disabled if they don’t rest. If there is no horse on the grassland, you can't go anywhere. When Siegel finally ordered a break, even the strongest knight felt aching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only snow around, if it is sleeping here, it will not be long before it will be buried. There is still a dry food left for everyone, but priority should be given to the mount. The knight will be all the way in his arms, and some warm oatmeal will be taken out and smashed and fed to the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana crouched down and swept the snow with her hands. There are some yellow hay below, which should be able to generate fire. She used her trembling hands to touch her pockets, hoping that the meteorites and iron pieces were not lost in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t be busy, let me come." Siegel first squatted on the horse and then let himself roll down. This road is really enough. You can't use the magic to resist the cold. You can't send the wind element to drive the snow. Even for the sake of safety, he will collect the dwarf belt, so he only relies on his physical quality and the power of nature. This is a battle that is doomed to not win. The only chance to survive is to admit defeat early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple action of pulling out the wand from the sleeves has been tried many times to complete, this ride is even more than climbing the cliff steps of Mora Be cruel. The road to the road is more tiring, but the body is close to the wall of the city, and there is no endless cold wind like a knife to scrape away heat. At that time, he could use the power of magic to flow through the body, and how much can be alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened his red eyes. Look at the knights around you. They are all good, with injuries on their bodies and persisted for so long. Several people fell to the ground when they fell. They want to get up, but the feeling of lethargy is gradually overwhelming. Death is lurking in the middle of peace. Never let these warriors lose their lives like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Magic! element! Listen to my order! Siegel yelled in his heart. His lips trembled and he couldn’t scream, but it’s okay to recite a few spells. The top of the wand glows brightly, like the dawn of a dark dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the spell trembled, but it remained intact, and Siegel’s wand made a large circle in the air. The wind and snow rolled, forming a skeleton, and the illusion gradually became real. The mage pulled the hay on the ground to the shadow. Then there is the melting snow and a piece of cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sturdy hut appears in the snow, much larger than the farmhouses that are common in the country. A sturdy, thick wooden door, two blinds, and bright light are transmitted through the gaps in the window. There is a chimney behind the house, and there must be a fireplace inside. There is always a little bit of fire coming out with the smoke coming from above, presumably it is extremely warm inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is better than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is struggling with each other, even if they want to fall, they will fall into the house - but walking in is not the best way. A knight patted the horse's buttocks and let him walk over with him, the first to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm air emerges from the inside of the house, like the softest but powerful hand in the world. Let everyone help one by one. This is not the illusion of everyone, but the invisible servant in the house. The “Shelter” spell is a refuge that the Master uses to overcome extreme environmental damage, and naturally takes into account various situations. As long as the spell is shaped. An invisible servant will appear in the hut and act according to the wizard's ideas. Although the invisible servant will disappear when he leaves the lodge too far, it is enough to move the people around him into the house one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the room is very simple, only a low table, eight stools and a writing desk. But the room has eight soft and comfortable beds, fluffy white pillows and silky soft quilts. The fire of the fireplace made everyone feel alive, and the eight beds made everyone hope for happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured here." Siegel found that his voice had become hoarse, and the throat was stinging, but it didn't matter. "Everything is made by magic, no pity. It's fine if it's dirty. Let's take a break and I will call you up after twenty minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Mana didn't lie down, she leaned against the fireplace. Eyes look at the door. The invisible servant is not completely invisible, and the person who casts the spell and his friend can see the blurred outline. The servant came in and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three more people on horseback." Mana said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head. "The servant said that they are dead and cannot move into the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess of warriors accept their souls and let them enter the Temple of the Warriors." Mana clasped her hands, and her blue arms trembled. "We need to cremate them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you can restore your physical strength, you can do it." Siegel took out the space bag and poured himself first. The bottle treated the potion and then ordered the servant to fill another bottle with Mana. It was not until this time that he felt that the control of the body returned to his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Take care of the outside horses and gather them at the door. There are feeds in the saddle pouch of the horse, feed them first." Mana said to the servant . Siegel nodded, the door opened and closed again, and things outside didn't have to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is ready-made food in the space bag, and Siegel and Mana first eat a few warm-smelling wines of the elf biscuits, then take out the jars and use them. Ale is used to cook the dry food of the march. They added dehydrated mushroom-dried pieces of meat and chopped potatoes, seasoned with garlic and onions, and sprinkled with a large amount of salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without twenty minutes, everyone climbed up. A total of six people sat down on the low stools, shared the same loaf of bread, and simmered in a crock with Siegel's "changed out" spoon. A few people don't talk because the tacit understanding of each other does not require linguistic communication at this time, only a few eyes can convey information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All go to sleep, there won't be any disturbing here." Siegel said: "I will show another hut and let the horse stay there. Everyone Drinking a bottle of healing potion, this is the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of 50 gold coins is not the usual cost of the Cavaliers, but since the Lord "pleases" . Who will be polite? Since there is no danger here, everyone will fall asleep. From the battle to the present, everyone did not wear armor, which really saved a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buzz of one after another echoed in the house. Siegel had no choice but to play a silent circle, which allowed him to sleep well. He woke up the next day. Strong physical resilience has basically returned him to his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear the breakfast in the pot, a lot of fat smells like a scent, which can help the body in the winter. Siegel pushed open the door, the snow outside had stopped, and the sun jumped out of the horizon, hanging lazily in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new day has arrived, a gust of wind blew, and the snow flakes on the ground danced for a while. The mage looks in the direction of the coming. The team's footprint has long disappeared into the snow, and no one can track it. Perhaps this time the elves have already heard the news of the death of the war tree squad, perhaps their mage priest and druid are looking at the wounds of the old tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of a number of ways to conceal his identity. In experiments with ordinary wood, 弩矢 will eventually be melted by the high temperature of the plasma, and no shape can be seen. Even the few slings that fell, Siegel is not very worried. He avoids using dwarf runes when designing, preventing the elves from attaching this weapon to themselves. At the same time, he does not use the Knox Commonwealth's characteristic spells. The entire squad is all standard textbook-like magic engravings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impeachment does not have a very high theory, only the assembly line that makes the impeachment. When the elf sees these items designed for war ancient trees, the first thing is to calculate the cost and manufacturing schedule. Follow the general algorithm. The elves will get the wrong conclusion: the only thing that can be equipped with magic weapons on this scale in the New World is only the Dwarf or the Masters Association. The former is easy to be excluded, so the elves will attack Deepwater City more urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Casper ** abandoned the merger with the Federation. Then he will leave with the original team of the Communist Party, otherwise he can only push the intensity of the war to a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the relationship between the half-evil Master Idis and the association of the Masters and the Federation, Siegel had this understanding: sooner or later, united Will be declining, and with him, there are dangerous elements in the Master. It's like concentrating the venom into a range of bodies and then slashing it with a knife. The common meeting is the venom, the elf is the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
