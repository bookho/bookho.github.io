			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet's painful low-pitched voice passed, and Siegel couldn't keep calm. His heartbeat suddenly increased, his breathing became heavy, and his muscles began to tighten. Siegel began to fight, and a feeling of panic and nausea spread from his chest to the whole body. He almost lost control of the hidden action. The young mage apprentice paused for a moment in the shadows and refocused his attention on the tasks to be completed next. He tried to ease his rapid heartbeat. "To have control," he secretly said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly peeping his head, he finally saw the inside of the short temple. The entire room was covered with cluttered red lines, like a crazy painter who knocked over all the paint cans. Five wooden chairs were evenly placed in the corner of the room. Four of them were tied to each other, tied with layers, and the cloth was stuffed with cloth. They closed their eyes and seemed to have lost consciousness. A red and blue mixed lamp servant is clutching Janet and pressing her on the fifth chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood magician is facing Siegel, he looks old and short, skinny, and the top of the light is covered with folds. He is focusing on the magical array, blood flowing from his thick blood vessels, and dropping his fingers on the ground. Whenever two lines intersect, there will be a strong flash of radiation. The smell of decaying rust in the air made Siegel feel uncomfortable, and the internal organs seemed to be mixed. The blood magician is thinking about words, and is very focused on casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hurry! Siegel said to himself. He picked up his toes and avoided all the magic lines on the ground to prevent the blood magician from feeling through the changes in the array. Breathing, airflow, sound, and reflection of weapons should be taken into account. Siegel held the dagger in one hand and the wand in the other. He walked through the arches, stone pillars, and wooden chairs, step by step toward the blood magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel swiftly slashed his knife and slid toward the blood magician's neck. All the problems can be solved with a single knife... But a magician always has a means of life-saving, especially the blood magician who works hard to survive. A magical barrier appeared on him, blocking the dragon's dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon tooth dagger in the hands of Siegel burst into pieces and also destroys the magic barrier. If the ordinary metal dagger is absolutely not effective, the dragon's teeth and some specific materials can cause such damage to the protective magic. The impact of the explosion made both people step by step, but the strong Siegel could recover faster. His wand shines and the energy missile is gestating. At the same time, the Obsidian Dagger was also drawn out and was about to launch a second attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp god first reacted. He waved his hand at the other end of the room. Siegel’s left wrist was hit hard and his wand was shot. However, the obsidian dagger was smoothly inserted into the back of the blood magician, piercing his left rib and penetrating from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took out the dagger and found no blood on it. He rushed to the lamp and did not fly before he stabbed a knife and directly cut the blood magician's cervical spine. The bare head immediately pulled down, but there was still no blood on the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no chance for a fourth knife, Assassin." The head hanging on the chest made a sound, and the blood magician turned around. The lamp god arrived, and the fist with lightning was in the nose of Siegel, even though he was unable to escape with the speed of his elves. A lot of blood-red tentacles emerged from the ground and the walls, layering and tying Siegel, numerous small thorns plunged into his skin, weak but dense currents swam through the body of Siegel, paralyzed Live this apprentice mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a brave and stupid act, you guy who sneaked." The blood magician used his hands to straighten his head and could see his heart pounding. A red line runs from the chest up the skin and under the eyes. The blood magician loosened his hands and his head was able to rotate normally, just as it was before being stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel finally saw the face of this blood magician, only to find that this person has been difficult to call human. His face is even more ugly than the zombies, the gray-white corpse has covered his forehead and cheeks, and the red eyeballs protrude from the eyelids, as if they are falling at any time. His entire mouth rotted, and the gums were revealed through his lips and chin. Numerous tiny blood vessels squirm under his skin, and the bright red blood continually flows through it, which contains powerful magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think that it is so easy to sneak into my back and kill me? The blood pumping in your heart is like a drum. I can hear it from a long distance." The blood magician picked up the obsidian dagger from the ground and looked at it with great interest: "But I didn't expect you to have such a good thing, dragon tooth and obsidian. You can hurt me, It’s worthy of praise. What reward should I give you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he widened his eyes and a very surprised expressionThe blood magician licks "perfect bloodliness? How can there be humans with perfect bloodlines?" At the same time, there are several wounds in Siegel: the back neck, fingers, apex, right waistHe "taste" the blood here, then closes his mouth, squints and stands quietly in the middle of the room.His fingers are shaking gently, it seems to be writing a spell out of thin air.You can see that his brows are sometimes wrinkled and sometimes relaxed. The blood magician has encountered an intractable choice, thinking and calculating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been trying to break free, but he is beginning to feel more and more hungryWith the rapid loss of physical strength, the power of magic resistance in exchange for him can restore consciousness in an instantBut the blood tentacle magic has always existed and continues to bind him.So Siegel will be paralyzed again, still under the control of the blood magician.He discovered the shortcomings of the twentieth scorpion magic resistance: it is difficult to get rid of the continuous spell effect<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove the old man from the chair and throw it aside, his blood is gone."The blood magician opened his eyes and immediately gave orders to the lamp god."Then, turned around and faced Siegel and said: "Your perfect blood system makes it difficult for me to give up, and you happen to be a mage, young and strong, really a smile of fate.I will be born again, and come back to the world with noble and powerful blood.But I never want to have a new body until now.Little assassin, you should be honored, I will continue to walk with your body, straight to the legend"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has widened his eyes. 'This is the effect of the bloody key spell. I am not a perfect bloodline, your senses are deceived!" 'He really wants to shout like this, but he is paralyzed, don’t say his tongue, and even the eyelids can’t move.He watched as Janet was tied up in a chair and fell asleep under the influence of magic.A strong old man got out of the chair and threw it in the corner like rubbishSiegel was tied down from the blood by the lamp god and tied to the old chair of the old man.However, his treatment is special, he has not been slumbered by casting.So he can clearly see that the blood magician is beginning to drop blood on the ground again, the new lines cover some old lines, and the whole magic matrix is ​​more complicated.Especially around Siegel’s chair, the blood lines are more dense than others.The Blood Sorcerer has been silent, preparing for this spell ritual with extraordinary concentration.Siegel didn't know how much blood he had flowed out. He could only estimate it. If the average person bleeds blood, he would have been a dead body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long ago, the blood magician finally completed the transformation of the magic array and stood up.He stared at Siegel with the blood-red eyes, and a cold, biting cold gas pierced the apprentice mage's mind like a steel needle.Siegel can't struggle, so his pain is multipliedHe looked at the eyes of the blood magician, tried to let himself ignore the pain, and concentrated on thinking about countermeasures.Even in such an unfavorable situation, Siegel will try to save himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a while, I will become you"The blood magician's eyes widened, and the bloodless red hell that was not at the bottom was hidden in the eyes."He asked coldly: "What else do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has been released from the bloody hands, he is already hungry The edge of death, but finally broke away from the state of paralysisHe knows that this is his only chance. He can't let the blood magician know, so he completely relaxes his muscles and pretends to be unable to move. He does not say, does not look, does not move.Then the light god flew over and took off his whole body, as he was when he was born.With the help of the twentieth scorpion, Siegel’s necklace, the space key and the scorpion itself were not found, and the wand and the weapon were thrown aside by the lamp god.He was thrown into the fifth chair, his head weakly on his shoulders - Siegel had been pretending to be paralyzed, even if the lamp god touched his lower body.The wizard focused on the magic array, and the result was that Siegel was mixed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood magician checked the circle and squinted the five people in the chair. He screamed and declared the victory: "Young apprentice mage, I really envy you, but also have the blessing of youth.You can't imagine the horror of death.I have mastered the blood, thinking that I can control my own, but the power of time still affects me.Except for blood, all my bodies are decaying and dying.He pulled off a layer of skin on his chin and threw it on the ground. Then he said, "After discovering this, I began to learn the power of the dead."Converting the lich can escape the erosion of time, but my blood magic interferes with this process, turning me into a human being, ghosts and ghosts.In the end, the only way I can live is the blood transfer that I created.Replace blood and reverse fateThis spell is destined to shock the world, and you are fortunate to be its carrier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his voice fell, the squad began to work, so Siegel saw Prince Aaron, Evan, Janet and a morning dawn. The guards, they blasted a small hole between their eyebrows, and the blood merged into a thin line, which was drilled out of the hole.The blood of the king is the thickest line, the blood of the demon is the finest, they gather together and concentrate on the top of the blood magician, forming a counterclockwise vortex, drilling from the middle of the skull.The blood magician's eyes emit bright light, like two fireballs burningHe cut the blood vessels of the wrists with the obsidian dagger, threw the daggers aside, folded the eyes together, let the wounds close together, letting their blood flow to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
