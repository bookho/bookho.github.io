			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door made a dull sound, and it seemed to be Mana’s voice outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, are you okay? The orc has already appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Support yourself from the sleeping bag and take a few deep breaths. Although the body is still a little tired, but the spirit is much better, it seems that long-term sleep has played its due role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am fine, you can organize defense." Siegel found his voice hoarse, so he swallowed and cleared his throat, then said: "In this battle, I am just a mage, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Lord Lord." Go far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel dismissed the servant, lifted the spell of closing the door, and removed the array of vigilance and called the guard. He only knew that he had slept for two days and two nights, even if the knocking of the outside construction did not wake him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder I am so hungry." Siegel said: "Give me some food to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although he carried food in his space bag, Siegel was willing to eat the same things as the knights and soldiers on the battlefield. Smoked fish, corned beef and hard cheese have a good taste but are enough to fill your stomach. The thick soup made of cabbage, carrots and turnips makes these things easier to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While eating, Siegel listened to the soldiers’ reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Dragon is not dead, but apparently seriously injured, can only lie far in the black channel, observe the movement inside the castle. The distance is too far, the heavy sling can not cover, and the light 弩 能够 can reach the position of the white dragon, but it has no power, so it can only be seen by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle was well organized in these two days. In addition to the arrangement of the defending city, the wealthy man also carried out a round of emergency renovation, filling with plaster and stones. The wall that was shattered by the black dragon. When cleaning the battlefield, the soldiers found two elements of the rune guard core, not enough of them are damaged by the acid, there is no possibility of repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mercenaries escorted by the mercenaries have already passed the fist, they are trying to come over the narrow bridge, but it is expected to take another four or five days. can. Currently. The supply of Black Blood Castle is full of warehouses, and it is not very urgent for the goods brought by the caravans. Plus the fresh meat from the Jackdaw Tribe. Siegel heard that today, in order to "celebrate" the orcs, the kitchen also deliberately added food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Blood Castle is above the mountains. It is much lower than the temperature of the Heim collar in the summer. But fortunately, everyone has been prepared to buy old clothes in various castles along the way, both to achieve the purpose and reduce the pressure of logistics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trebuchet was reassembled and the tall boom was pointed at the sky. But now that the orcs have appeared, according to the plan made by Heim, these slingers should start to tighten the winch, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel ate all the food on the plate in front of him and listened to the report. The battlefield is like a chess game. He has already laid the board and placed the pieces in the most favorable position. Now it is the turn of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a "beep" in the courtyard, and a round stone was thrown out. The stone hit the black passage and made a dull sound. Subsequently, the trebuchet was re-arranged. Another test was conducted. The results of all test shots are recorded so that they can be called at any time after the battle begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the dusk, smoke from the north side of the walled mountain range, obscuring the afterglow of the setting sun. Everyone is guessing what the orcs are doing, they don't need a torch to illuminate, and they don't need so much wood to make a fire. Everyone talked a lot, but Mana just let the soldiers do a good break, and the half-orc of the 哼ke bowed to the night to avoid the orc sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the next day, no enemy entered the attack range of the Black Blood Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bailong blocked the only channel that could be turned over. So Black Blood Castle knows nothing about the actions of the orcs. The battle of dragging and pulling has never begun, and the two sides have spent a quiet day in the wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing on the orc's position, think about what the purpose of their trip is." Siegel said: "The Black Blood Castle is actually not very useful for them. It is best to occupy, but not for them. The reason for the squatting. It is only the rapid southward trip to Deepwater City that the battle with the elves is the mission of these orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded: "Yes. This is indeed the case." She waited for Siegel's following, but the Lord did not say anything, but returned the line of sight back to the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight calms down and follows the thoughts just now, only to conclude that the orcs will not fight, but only to pass quickly. At the foot of the mountain, the cavalry of the Jackdaw tribe is stationed. As long as the orcs are not formed into a large-scale downhill, they will be shattered by the cavalry of nearly 10,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly realized that Siegel had thought of this long before, so he arranged the jackdaw tribe. This encounter with the orcs does not require the enemies in front of them. Just disperse them as much as possible and safely cause as much damage as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her question still hasn't been answered: What kind of preparations does the orc have to do to pass the Black Blood Castle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, even Kerry was a little impatient, and it was increasingly difficult to suppress the idea of ​​going to Deepwater City for looting. At this time, the orcs acted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first appearance is the white dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc used the material from the mountain to make a "shield" for Bailong. To be more precise, they bundled with overlapping trunks to create a "scaffolding" that could be shackled by White Dragon on the shoulders. Whether it is the 弩矢 or the slinger projectile, it is necessary to smash this layer of protection before it can hurt the white dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Black Blood Castle don’t understand what it means, even if there is a "shield" dragon who dare not rush into the castle, is it not afraid of repeating the same? The black dragon's cover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Bailong began to squirt ice in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Walled Mountain Range is very tall and a large part is above the snow line. The Black Blood Castle was built on one of the cliffs on the downhill road on the south side of the mountain range, just overlooking the easy-to-access valley. The castle is below the snow line and there is no snow in the midsummer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is snow on the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the spit progresses, White Dragon continues to increase the weight of the snow, and then uses its power to "walk" in the ice and snow to create a small avalanche. In the roar of the mountain, thousands of tons of snow slide down the valley to form a white passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this passage, Bai Long "lifted" the shield and walked down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, it still walks on the black channel paved by grievances, and the banned rune array has limited effect on it. The thicker the snow, the more obvious the power of the rune matrix, so the white dragon does not need a thick layer of snow, just a layer of ice that can slide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Black Blood Castle are really fools if they don’t understand Bailong’s plan at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Dragon is using his talent to create an ice slide so that the orcs can cross the line of the Black Blood Castle at an extremely fast speed. He also predicted that the castle would continue to attack, using stone bombs, rolling wood, and fire oil to take turns, which would destroy the condition of the ice and snow field, so it needs to stay on the battlefield in order to continue to use the spit to maintain the condition of the ski resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect it, only create a "shield" that a dragon can use, blocking all kinds of attacks from the castle. In addition, the orc's witchcraft is also under the shield's cover with the white dragon, constantly casting spells, mostly to protect against long-range weapon damage and protective element damage. Despite the interference of the Wraith Channel and the Forbidden Circumstance environment, the effect and duration of the spell were greatly reduced, but still blocked most of the attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuel barrel!" Mana shouted. “Ignite the fire wall!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ramp on the side of the wall for the fuel tank. The rope can also be used to adjust the direction of the exit. The vats filled with fire were pushed out and rolled up on the ramp, making a rumbling sound. Some of the barrels smashed on the mountain wall, while others plunged into the thick snow and did not spread out. Mana did not scream at the strange action of pushing the barrel, but immediately ordered the release of the rocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
