Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The running dog of your system, the ruler of the fortune, don't want to get information from me!" The man said while spitting on the ground. The blood was spit, and there were half of the broken teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gathered the power of the element in his hand and threatened him: "The mouth is hard useless, the power of magic always makes me know that I want to know Information!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sad magic will not always save your life, save it. I won't tell you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only need to lick a god and I will always find your faith." Siegel pretended to have a vicious smile. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The area snoring, can't ask for it." The man laughed: "Your childish behavior can only make future revenge more intense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stared at him and glanced at him, put away his smile and became serious again. "The believer of the murderer is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter of the man came to an abrupt end, watching Siegel with an incredible look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master came down from the horse and took out the Obsidian Dagger on the ground to draw the sacred emblem of the murder god. Later, he stabbed the center of the emblem with a serpentine dagger and twisted it with force. The captive struggled with anger and wanted to rush like a wild dog. His hands and feet were tied, but he still tried to bite Siegel with his teeth. Mike slammed on his back and let him move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the believers of the murder god, death is nothing." Siegel said: "Cut off his limbs, knock on his teeth, close In the cell, let him live a lifetime and reflect on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Mike grabbed the man's neck and prepared to take him from the ground. Lift it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power appears in the end!" The man shouted and bit his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel snorted and he expected this result. "Remember, these guys are never afraid of death, and they don't use the tricks. They don't have honor and fairness. You all get up and don't be deceived by them! They don't even care about their lives. They won't pity you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lord Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼克叫来士兵,就咬舌The body of the person was towed away and burned with fire. This man didn't even wear black clothes. It may be just a small role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder god lives in various folktales, unlike other gods, he has never sent a saint to the mortal world. The Masters Association believes that this is a manifestation of the lack of power of the murder god. After all, his philosophy is not mainstream, resulting in few believers. Even the assassin who lives on killing people. The god of murder is not as important as money. Only those who are mad in the fun and pursuit of killing will truly have the power to worship the god of murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despise order, despise magic, and sacrifice for your own interests in order to kill, just to pursue the feeling of destruction. This is a collection of lunatics, conspirators and killers, but when did they have such a strong force? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the ability to jump out of the shadows? Can you break through the rune tree of the Elven Forest and go deep into the Druid jungle? Siegel knows that there is a spell in the Master called "The Shadowing" that allows people to move fast in the shadow world and penetrate a physical obstacle. This spell requires shadow as an exit and entrance. But the line shadow technique involves a higher spelling skill and plane knowledge than the teleportation, even though Siegel is not currently in control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the power of shadows can only come from the disturbance of the gods to the world. The residuals of the Holy Spirit on the assassins seem to illustrate this. This is back to the question just now: Why is the power of the murder god growing so fast? Due to the priesthood, most of the gods do not like the god of murder, especially the gods of race and the powerful gods in the field of protection and life. Maybe kill one or two people, even provoke a war, other gods will turn a blind eye, but directly rushed to the Elven Forest to kill, which will undoubtedly violate the Luna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leah is still trying to convince her people, but it doesn't look good. From the expression point of view, the Druid fiercely opposed, the Master stood on the side of Lia. The priests of the Temple of the Moon continue to look at the human army with suspicion. They seemed to perceive Siegel's gaze, and the Elf Mage waved his hand and used the spell to block all attempts to snoop. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana commanded the mount and slowly came to Siegel, and lowered his voice and said: "The lord, the reserve team, has arrived, and has reached the west twenty miles. Need to have any arrangements? Do you want to take the opportunity to pinch the elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them come over and make a look of two thousand people." Siegel said "Then then line up on the north side of the battlefield and prepare for the defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defense?" Mana asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't get it wrong." Siegel said: "The elf is very proud. He is not afraid of our attacks, because they look down on the offensive capabilities of other races. So the offensive The posture will make them feel hot and lose their calm thinking. The defensive posture will satisfy their imagination and make them rational."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted, Ma Na said: "This is not exactly what you said, be rational?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s eyes blinked and said: "I am going to arrange a battle, The Lord of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and humans are squatting up and down the hills, and neither of them will show weakness. This is a contest of will, which seems to be more important than life and death. All the Knights of Heim’s collar were also dismounted and stood with the soldiers. In addition to the sound of the wind and the roar of the mount, both sides remained silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two hours, from the north, neat footsteps, Heim’s reinforcements arrived at the battlefield. They used a spear to beat the shield rhythmically, making a creaking sound, which is more exciting than the marching drums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their arrival, they greatly extended the length and thickness of the Heims line, and had a huge advantage in terms of strength. Followed by the reinforcements, there are also carts requisitioned from the caravans, which also carry the tools of the battlefield supply and construction camps. According to Mana's orders, the reinforcements used these tools to quickly build barriers to limit the battlefield and began to create simple shield walls for the shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf saw this scene and finally made up his mind. Mana led the priest of the Moon Temple to the center of the battlefield and played the banner of the talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana, you can't go this time." Siegel said to her: "You must continue to command, lest the elves move their brains."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight nodded and promised to make the lord more insecure. Mike pointed at himself with his fingers and made a loud laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you are thinking. Mike, but this time you have no part of it." Siegel said with a smile: "The elf most wants to surrender." The object is the orc. I know that you are not an orc, only half of the lineage, but don't irritate their fragile soul. Sir Grenner. Take a walk with me. Your family has a long history, want to add a fallen elf Deeds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forever to serve you, Lord Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanying Master Lia Pastor Siegel, who has also seen it, has a temperamental female elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the current environment, let's talk about it, don't use temptation anymore." Siegel said to the elf priest: "You If you pull out the sword and point at me, I am afraid that there is only one way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf pastor nodded, the voice was soft and gentle. "Siegel Lord, I have the same hope. In order to be able to complete the Luna's instructions, we agree to make concessions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak something practical." Siegel said: "I have already asked for my request. How are you negotiating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea looked at the priest, and the latter nodded She said: "We are only an army of elves. All agreements are limited to between Heim and the Southwest Army. We cannot represent the Elven Forest. You can't represent the people of the New World. Do you agree?"
