			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, is it your ghost, shut me up in the force cage for an entire hour?" Evan wiped his body, but The whole body still exudes the taste of sea water. Www*xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you chopped the force field with a bonfire?" Siegel snorted two times and was not embarrassed at all: "I Never guess the tide, the force shield should have supported the sea again and will not submerge your caves. Who knows that you will complete the battle ahead of time. In fact, if it weren't for me, you would have been washed away by the sea. Don't know if you look at the surroundings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Evan scratched his face. "Please tell me, you didn't peek."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so bored." Siegel rolled his eyes and said in an exaggerated tone: "Peeping under the sire of the king... you know what crimes will be sentenced." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the next turn Evan is speechless. The law of the kingdom of the stars does not stipulate so detailed, and here is not the territory of the kingdom of stars, so there is no way to punish Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The portal to the city of Mith will be opened tomorrow morning, I will leave with the army, so you still have the lingering time tonight, don't play Too much fire, it can not climb up." Siegel said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go back to the city of Miele and don't want to go through the transmission channel." Evan suddenly said. "I have to pick up the gem, I can't throw it in the stable of the farm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can pass the past and take it with me. The horse is still within the scope of my ability to deliver." Siegel said: "I heard that you have clarified your identity in the stronghold. I think this news will spread soon. There are many in the southern lords, but you The supporters of his brother Aaron, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not make any impulsive move. And Chanem also knows the news, although I think he will not show up or personally assassinate you, but as the saint of the murder god, arrange The plot against you is what he is best at. Only the secret city on the New World is safe. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand this. Evan nodded, but he was obviously not convinced. "Just be my last wayward, enjoy the feeling of freedom. I have decided, after completing the trip back to the city of Miele, I will return to the kingdom of stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I didn't think of it." The wandering king is tired of being an adventurer, or is there something else happening? Siegel waved and protected the two of them. People outside will only think that they are chatting. "Are you ready to climb the throne. Do you rule the kingdom of stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come and let me be a prophet and tell you about the future. Evan picked up a branch from the ground and pretended to be a wand and made a few gestures. Then he said in a low and exaggerated voice: "Oh. I have already seen the light of the future, the long river of time." Oh, the mirror of destiny reflects my destiny: When I returned to the city of Myrtle, the stubborn Count of Parker had contacted many lords and courtiers, and invited me back to the king to preside over the overall situation. At that time, I will They will refuse the temporary crown they created, because only the top of Aaron’s head is the symbolic orthodox crown. This war will start in my name, but no matter what choice I make, it will burn.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pike..." Siegel really disliked the rigid, rude viscount. "What are you talking about are actually your guesses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is indeed speculation, ten will happen." Evan put away the joke . Seriously said to Siegel: "In fact, before being invited to come here, Parker has secretly contacted some lords and sought their support. When I set foot on the coast of the Star Kingdom, there will be an army waiting for me there. They will prepare my banner and everything needed to embark on the road to the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aaron over there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, I can succeed, but only I can lead them to failure." Evan said: "I will control the situation and see the situation of Aaron. You know him. The body...just a matter of time. My only hope is to prevent the kingdom of the stars from getting into chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can send a force to follow you to ensure absolute obedience Your order. You have also seen the power of even the power of the pulp, they will protect your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand. These political things are harder than spells. Only Janet explained here that I can fully understand." Siegel thought for a moment, then said: "Since you want to be low-key, then let me, I Give you a special elemental rune guard, a giant gas element. You can carry it with you and let it protect you when you are in danger. The general army can't fight this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How big is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty meters high, probably." Siegel said: "The gas element can fly." And it is still stable. If it is a fire element, you will be directly burned to death by standing next to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, take it out and absolutely scare them!" Wen said: "But you have given me the best magic equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a hundred-faced scorpion from his collar, in front of Siegel Shaking: "Seeing no, there are numbers that are lit up, from one to forty-seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Is it?" Siegel almost pulled out his eyes: "Is it any effect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I quickly figured out Evan took out his long sword and waved it a few times, then demonstrated the set of swords in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as my method of using the sword is correct, the number above will become higher. That is, as long as I keep trying, I can continue to find more Good, stronger swordsmanship. Now I can only push the numbers up to fifty-three, but I believe that one day I can reach one hundred, maybe that is the pinnacle of swordsmanship. Unfortunately, you can only go to two. Ten, hahahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My nephew is not so useful." Siegel took his own nephew and looked at it, it was still the same. There is no slight change. It seems that this thing has nothing to do with its own strength. Even if it becomes a teacher, it still does not understand its usage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some deaths know how to turn on the function of the dice, and now Siegel knows that they are actually the souls of the writer in this world. In the face of the destruction of their world, the writers have been studying the power of the scorpion, and have also created a ring that locates the scorpion. The emergence of the New World is also the demise of the world of writers. It has been thousands of years since now, and why the blind man will reappear in this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Master’s materials have no records of scorpions at all, as if they have never appeared in history. In today's world, apart from the ruin, the gods may know the relevant situation, but they are also tight-lipped. Different scorpions seem to be different functions. Evan’s one-sided scorpion is to make his swordsmanship reach its peak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't tried archery or other weapons like spears, will there be any change in the face?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan shook his head: "Only the long sword, the short sword, the giant sword, the epee and the fine sword, there is no double-headed sword at hand, I have not tried. Nothing else is outside the sword. But I don't care about other weapons. It's good to use a sword. It's better to learn too much than to specialize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you, at least you know how your nephew is used, I have to continue to explore." Siegel thought for a while and said: "Evan, this nephew always reveals mystery, can't solve the mystery, I sleep. Difficult. Since the Stars of the Stars have stored your scorpion scorpion with a special magic array, you may find clues in the records of the royal family to help understand the origins of this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, I will pay attention. I will also open all the information of the royal family at that time, so that you can check it out enough." Evan patted Siegel's shoulder intimately. "I really didn't see you." Is a person who can do research. Isn't it so tired to learn so many kinds of knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not fall asleep the light bother you? "Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I guess you will refute me like this." Evan squinted at Siegel’s shoulder and walked all the way, saying that they were all the first to recall them. After meeting in Ximu Town, two people ate and drank at the banquet. "My swordsmanship will get higher and higher, your spells will get stronger and stronger, and we will agree that a fair fight will never happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't say forever, I think I always think of ways.” Siegel said to Evan: “When I meet next time, do I want to call you a sire for the king?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
