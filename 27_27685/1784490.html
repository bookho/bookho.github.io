			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the cover formed by the light waves, Evan is waving the demon sword "Bonfire" and slams it again and again. As the blacksmith forged the hot sword, the mask also spattered the glowing fragments. These pure elemental energy mixed into pieces will burn after falling on the ground, and then a green smoke will emerge and turn into a pool of mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mask is constantly being generated, and there is a layer below the layer. Seeing that he was doing useless efforts, Evan changed his strategy, piercing the sword into the mask and pressing it with the power of the whole body. A wave of shocks was uploaded from the blade, as if it had been beaten by a strong man. Evan has never suffered such injury and suffering since the swordsmanship. He clenched his teeth, rubbed his legs on the ground, and pushed the broken sword to the depths of the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The outside people are working hard, but unfortunately there is no time to save you." Jarrell spoke, but the movements in his hands did not stop. Two short swords flew up and down, often drilling into the squad's defensive circle from an impossible angle. If it is not responsive and flexible, Siegel has long been stabbed and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master is struggling to support, but never lost confidence. The more you are at the crisis, the more you have to calmly look for opportunities; but again, if you can't find an opportunity, you can only desperately desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the time of desperation - Siegel’s weapon was held by a double sword, and the strength of the two men was equal, and a stalemate occurred at this moment. He suddenly changed into a single-handed sword and vacated one hand to touch the belt. Jarre's double sword was twisted, and the dust of the stars turned to Siegel's shoulder. However, the dust of the star is only the edge of the sword, the other places are like a blunt sword, and with the protection of the armor, Siegel is unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the dragon tooth dagger was smashed out by Siegel and went straight to Jarrell's lower abdomen. The slowest movement in all parts of the body is the abdomen, so it is the most difficult to avoid. Jarrell frowned and twisted his body, but it was a step late. The dragon's tooth daggers open the coat and leave a long wound on his body. The blood immediately oozing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are no longer a ooze." Siegel endured the pain from his limbs, his feet kept spinning around Jarrell. . "Do you believe in the god of murder or the god of ooze? Don't you feel sticky and disgusting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarire changed his face, Something came to my lips but I endured it. Just speed up the movements on my hands again. When the mask opens and repels the element, Siegel has a cold heart. He knows that his swordsmanship is not as good as Evan. If he is entangled in that strange mucus, the trouble can be great. But Jarrell only fights with ordinary tricks, meaning nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Siegel estimates that the mask also has an impact on Jarrell. Finally found the opportunity to test. The blood that ran down was the beacon of navigation in the dark, pointing out the direction of progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yariel, how long has it been, is it almost two minutes?" Siegel said to him: "Tick, ticking, ticking, time lapse Like water, why not desperate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The short sword of the handle stabbed Siegel's right ear, blocked by the dust of the star, and the other short sword seized the opportunity and went straight to the throat. Siegel had not stabbed his sword and took the initiative to bow forward. The control range of the short sword is closer than that of the long sword. But there are still blind spots. Siegel did not open the safe distance of the cast, simply hit it up and fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it can't become a sticky muddy state, it's not terrible to be close to me. If the long sword does not play out, then the short sword will be equally uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blood line flew from the side of Siegel's neck, but fortunately only scratched the skin, did not hurt the blood vessels. As soon as he hesitated a little, he would become an active cut throat. Evan took a breath of air and screamed. He appreciates Siegel's calm and decisive determination and action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three arms-handed hands are all in the air, and Siegel puts the only left hand without weapons on the wound in the belly of Jarrell. I slammed it in with my fingers. This amazing pain should allow ordinary people to faint directly, but Jarrell is obviously not so easily defeated. He crossed the short sword and slashed Siegel's neck from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the taste of the plasma with your body!" Siegel ignites the plasma lines in the body, and puts huge energy directly from the fingertips. Riel's body. The violent energy turns his body into a glowing skin. The bones and internal organs have a clear shadow on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light curtain disappeared, and Evan was awkward and almost fell. "Is it finally killed?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and inserted the dragon's dagger back into his waist, his hands reaching into the long sleeve of the other hand. He took a few steps, a swaying, unsteady look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have a therapeutic agent? Give me a bottle." Siegel tilted his eyes and said, "My space bag." It seems that I still can't open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look for it, I remember to take it with me." Evan licked from behind the waist and didn't take out the pharmacy bottle. But found a flying knife. He threw out in the direction of Siegel's eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel waved his arms, one hand took the wand from the sleeve, and the other hand was the obsidian dagger. "Explicitly, lurking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of magic illuminates the hall, and a figure is forced out of stealth. His body is not completely physical. In some places, there is a black mist transpiration, and the contours of the body also have many transparent areas. He has a snake-shaped dagger in his right hand, with a faint green light on it, and the other hand is in front of his eyes, covering the dazzling glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is awesome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind dagger of Avon’s blindly thrown was obviously lucky, and he actually hit the target and penetrated the arm of Jarrell. Siegel waved his weapon and cut off his wrist holding a serpentine dagger. Jarrell made a painful roar, his left hand was claw-shaped, and he grabbed Siegel's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire came over from the oblique thorn and cut the claw. Then Evan pulled the sword down and cut off the muscles of Jarrell's legs. Just as he was going to continue the attack, Siegel stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan said that he was puzzled: "What do you want to do with him? Do you still expect him to tell you what information?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not that stupid." Siegel said: "I just want to know what will happen after two minutes." He looked at Jarrell, who was roaring on the ground, watching him become The clay-like body tries to heal. The mage hit the beat with his finger and made a "tick and ticking" sound in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes have passed, the black clay is burning. Jarrell is dead at this time, so there is no scream. Including **, clothes, and weapons, the flames burned all traces of his existence in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames continually beat and ignited the body of the remaining black assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This flame is pretty good." Evan carefully glanced around. The muscles are still tight. Who knows where to jump out of an assassin! These guys are out of the blue, and they can't always rely on the instinctive reaction of the soldiers to prevent them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's relax, there are no enemies around." Siegel summoned the defensive wand to his hand, relying softly on it. He opened the space bag and took out a bottle of healing potion and sipped it up. The cool medicinal agent gives him a comfortable feeling from the body. At least that burst of pain was temporarily suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have a strong ability to hide and sneak, but they are not as good as the dragon in my territory." Siegel took out a bottle of medicine and poured it. On several more serious wounds, then grinning and saying: "I have seen how they disappeared, and there are ways to prevent them. When you add them to the magic array as an early warning, you can rest in peace." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really convenient as a mage, and you can think of anything. But at the most critical time, even the best brains still have a good skill." Evan also slashed into the sheath and came over to reach Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have been lazy recently. I haven’t exercised for a long time." Siegel snapped a finger, summoned the floating disc, and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the comfortable mage, Evan snorted, but also sat up, not at all. Although he did not seem to have many wounds, in fact most of his injuries occurred in the body, and the shock of the internal organs caused him to vomit. Since there is an effortless way to move, Evan will naturally not be stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know why I stopped you from killing him at the end?" The float floated, and Siegel said to Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
