			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage Wendy walks slowly on the spiral staircase of the Magic Tower, and some are absent-minded. The elf army surrounded by the wall outside the hub of the fortune made her feel uneasy, especially in the presence of some powerful magical fluctuations. Those who are wizards of the elves, they always look at the Red Mage Tower with dangerous eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no attack here, the elf just surrounds the city. Some time ago, I heard that the new lord, Mullenstadt, sent his own cavalry unit out of the city, in an attempt to retrieve some of the supplies and squadrons that were transported by the satellite castle. The elf attacked the team and only two lucky guys came back alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the hub was closed, and not only the soldiers were allowed to enter and exit, but even the hungry people who fled the disaster were kept outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hub of the castle is self-contained, even the soldiers are beginning to reduce the daily food rations, how can there be spare capacity to manage those refugees? Every night, there is a desperate mourning sound coming from outside the city wall. At first, it disturbs people's dreams. Later, as the sound is reduced, everyone can sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower was built in the city, only Knox will do this, but now clearly see the benefits. As part of the city, there are naturally guards on the walls and guards on the walls, saving the Master a lot of energy. Moreover, the fluctuations of thinking generated by urban residents every day are the source of energy for the mage tower, which is strengthened by the enchantment system, and can improve the magic water bottle of all mages inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty is not a member of the Knox Association. She has been in the Mage Federation for more than fifteen years and is a mage specializing in protective spells. Most of the time she focuses on studying spells, helping other wizards to perform spell tests, and there are few opportunities to leave the Three Peaks. Only during the war, she can come to the south and enjoy the scenery of other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This red mage tower has magical power, Wendy feels that it can perfectly match his magical fluctuations, the Master Tower is part of itself, the energy inside Can be called as you wish. In addition to her, other mages who came here have similar feelings, and self-confidence has been strengthened to varying degrees. This wrong judgment of your own strength. Increased the rate of failure when she casts spells, and many of the ability to manipulate spell details is also declining. Wendy took a lot of energy to slowly adapt to this strange state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Master of the Knox Commonwealth seems to be completely unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to providing unrealistic confidence, this Master Tower has other things that make Wendy dissatisfied. I don’t know where the bald heads learn from the art, but actually hangs so many portraits of people on the walls. Men, women and children. Different identities and costumes are all serious and rigid faces. Is it from the hands of the same boring artist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter feels his long hair, supple and bright and straight down to the waist, this should be a long hair that can make men smile. She hopes that these portraits will show a smile. At least let your mood be better. But I don't know why, when she had this thought, she suddenly shuddered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the Red Magic Tower glow lightly, originally without color, but by the influence of the walls, people always feel red, like blood. Wendy has heard some rumors that there have been deaths here, and several mages have lost their lives because of the failure of spell experiments. This is an ominous sign, just like a curse, other wizards often encounter failures when casting spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they are also affected by strange self-confidence. This leads to failure. But since you have overcome it, you will not be disturbed, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light still casts a black shadow, and a voice is heard in the shadow, "Wenty..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master stopped and looked at every corner of the spiral staircase without seeing a figure. She looked in the direction of the sound, and there was nothing in the shadow. Is this an illusion? Wendy only felt mentally exhausted - maybe it should be a break, and there was no war with the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter has been busy reinforced the magical enchantment of the Magic Tower, especially the part of spells such as protection transmission, which is the most important of all projects. Under the layered defense. Relying on the current is simply not going to come. Even if a few powerful wizards use their unique spellcasting techniques to move forward, they will inevitably trigger a magical alert here. In a moment, the intruder will be suppressed by the power of the entire tower and attacked by various spells. This kind of foolproof protection made her feel at ease. Those elf mages are just as far away as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy is also an important figure. After all, the Magic Tower is now known to most of the protective enchantments. The first is to check and routine maintenance, and the second is to let her know where there is room to continue to play. Used to add new spell effects. Every day, she spends a few hours walking through the entire Master Tower, and at other times she learns magic in the library – this is a gift of importance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the threat of the outer elves, and the books here are far from the Three Peaks, Wendy will say that this is a good place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound rang again, and the protective mage was shocked. A thought opens the protective spell on the body. The layers of auras and shrouds are tightly guarded, and some of the magic also detects hostile presence around them. As a protective specialist, he can open and break the protective spell at any time, using the duration of the original spell. A higher level of protection mages can maintain a greater number of spell effects at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these protections, she can observe it more closely. The sound is still transmitted from the shadow of the red crystal wall, and there must be problems there. Wendy has the courage to constantly add confidence to herself, and she has to resist the trembling and slowly leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black figure appears in the wall, Wendy swears before there is absolutely no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting evil magic did not issue a warning, and there was no reaction to seeing the illusion, so the black figure is real? Wendy doesn't like this, but she will never step back and firmly fix herself in place. The characters in the surrounding portraits seemed to be staring at him, his mouth slightly upturned, waiting to see her jokes - she would not let these people wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you talking?" Wendy reached out, but could touch the cold crystal wall. The black figure is in the middle of a translucent crystal wall and cannot be touched. The shadow floated in the same posture as swimming. Gradually getting bigger in the field of view. Although it is not true, Wendy still barely distinguishes the appearance of the shadow: a middle-aged human man, with a hollow face and a round face without any hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so happy to die..." the shadow said, but the misery in the voice clearly appeared in her heart. Wendy felt her heart jump to the eyes of her throat. Is this a new means of the dead spirit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this powerful mage tower, how can there be a dead spirit? Wendy forced herself to calm down. She is very afraid of the dead spirit, which has nothing to do with her spell power, but from the legends heard in childhood, but also because of the psychological weakness caused by her parents being killed by the ghouls in the wandering field. Don't let the ghost know the timidity and fear. That will encourage their strength. Wendy turned the ring on her hand, which stored the courage of the Warrior's God Priest, which she exchanged with a number of protective magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, she said in a trembling voice: "You...what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Happiness with me..." The shadow gradually grew bigger and then stuck to the wall, as if to reach out. The pair of black arms have sharp, long claws that are constantly rubbing against the pink crystal. Without the need for his own ears, Wendy heard the sharp, harsh friction in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't come to me!" Wendy showed a magical missile, but only on the crystal wall, and it didn't work. The shadow of the black shadow moved a little. Its mouth widens as if it is smiling. Later, Wendy saw two more shadows appearing on the wall, like her fear, getting bigger and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t stop moving back and retreated to the edge of the spiral staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What kind of spell? Wendy forced himself to think. The material of the magic tower itself is very resistant to spells. Flame acid and cold are hard to produce effects, and only the penetration of electric shock is better. Although the magic tower is more protective to the outside world, the inside is not much better. In particular, in order to avoid the damage caused by the loss of control of the spell test, some places have specifically strengthened the protection of the elements, which he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, she couldn’t think of how to crack the familiar protection system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two groups of shadows have gradually grown up. Finally, three humanoid strange shadows are formed on the wall. They kept repeating "death" and "happiness", and Wendy closed her eyes and blocked her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
