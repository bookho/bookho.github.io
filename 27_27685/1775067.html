			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clandestine of the city of Mithra issued an alarm, the runes on the wall flashed, the elemental energy of the entire territory suddenly stagnated, and then concentrated on the energy focusing lens . In addition to Siegel with the rune core, Janet with the delivery headdress, and Capricorn, who always wears a lollipop, other people use the transmission spell to alert the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought that the elf would ride over - after all, the distance between the two would be a few kilometers - I did not expect him to use the transmission. He seized the core of the rune and temporarily stopped the magic counterattack in the brewing with the mind communication. Originally, as long as a large number of elements are gathered at the point of transmission—for example, by using a method of forcibly summoning elements, and quickly and without changing the types of elements, resulting in always elemental convergence but never really stopping—it can seriously disturb the stability of the spell. Even directly causing the transmitter to get lost in the transition plane of the transmission spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy lens calms down, a silver-white beam of light descends from the sky, and the elf's old mage appears in front of Siegel. It seems that only one came to the city of Mire, and the other two are still in the camp of Leah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel can take a closer look at the wizard wizard. The years left too many traces on him, and the deep wrinkles seemed to hide the past history. His hair and eyebrows are completely white, and only the hair roots have a slight silvery luster. The loose skin and wrinkled eye lines hide the deep eyes, leaving only a slit to observe the surroundings. The elf mage came back and put most of his body weight on a waist-high cane. Coincidentally, that is actually a defensive staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to bother, Siegel. The squid lord, the baron, the mage.” The elf old man introduced himself: “I am Ricapa. Manod, Academy of Arts..." He paused, revealing a naughty smile, and then said: "I am a teacher, very strong, at least you can't beat me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is preparing for the ceremony, and hearing this sentence has a bit of a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My time is precious, I will not talk nonsense with you." Rikapa clerk cleared his throat. Looked at the staff in the hands of Siegel. If you are not mistaken, this is the defensive staff of the Masters Association? He hesitated, but still reached out and said: "Knox will jointly design the detailed map of the Red Magic Tower emotional control array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Shaking his head and saying: "I have seen the design of the one in the hub. But the time hastily cannot be completely copied. The sketch has already given you the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you take a walk with me and crack the spell effect together." He said, he would come to Rasig's wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the transmitted light is lit again, only to hear the buzz of the dragon. The strong Longwei is like a real storm. Swept the entire tower. Siegel was shocked without resistance, and the body could not move, and even thoughts were stagnant for a moment. **The body is flashing, and the oval aperture dissipates layer after layer. But he just took a step, then he held the cane and still stood firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capricorn came out of the transmission, her arms and feet were long, and the sharp claws shone with energy. The flames formed by the four elements swept through the air, leaving behind a ruthless shadow. However, if it is scratched by this claw, most of the magic shield will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome magic dragon." said the wizard. Although he clenched his defensive staff. But still with a kind smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little girl..." He thought about it and felt that he couldn’t judge himself from the appearance of the dragon who was older, so he coughed twice and stunned. Cover up the past. "I am Rikapa Amanod. I came here after I was allowed, not an intruder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he didn't say " I am a teacher, very strong, you can't beat me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn has not relaxed its vigilance, and there are flashes of light in the pupils of different colors. Just before the magical alarm of Heim’s collar, she immediately felt a strong magical fluctuation. Set up Janet and Isaac. Relying on the energy connection with the magic array, the location of the intruder is determined and transmitted immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel managed to regain consciousness and immediately adjust the power of the magical elements within the group. But he can't move his body. There is no way to cast a spell. The ups and downs of energy that can only rely on magic cause the attention of the dragon girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is not good to deal with." The dragon girl said: "It will be very time-consuming and laborious, you have to compensate me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not fight first, you will put Heim The collar was flattened," Siegel said quickly. For the dragon, time-consuming and laborious means a rather long battle. It may be calculated in months. When the dragon discovered that he could not take a mage very quickly, he would take the tactics of sawing, guerrilla, sneak attack and peripheral harassment. The dragon can sleep for a hundred years or sleep for a hundred years. Masters of other races may not have such skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the face of Capricorn, her delivery is not worse than the average Master, it is basically impossible to pull the distance in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently grasped the shoulders of Capricorn, let her relax, and then said to the elf: "There are many things in the territory, the walls There is an army that besieged me. As a local lord, I can't leave with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricapa's cane gently taps the ground, hard rune There were several shallow pits in the tower. In the visual field of view, the tip of the defensive cane gathers a large number of elements, which forms such an effect. Siegel knows that the sorcerer in front of him has a ** specializing in plastic energy, and has great restraint on the elemental power of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I want to catch you, I will succeed." The elf said: "The easiest way is to threaten if you don't follow me." Some of my old friends have been attacking the Heim collar. Unless you have several such dragons, you can't stop it. Do you think I am right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and replied: "Your elves have this ability, but you can't force me to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We You can do something about your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord smiled and shook his head: "Your thought-controlling spells should not be as common as Knox, otherwise I will not come to me to cooperate and study how to deal with the crimson minaret. I know that the Communist Party is good at ideological manipulation. How can we prevent it? Even if your mana is strong, I can ruin you before you succeed. What you want. By relying on threats, you never get the best results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "According to your Association of Masters, everything needs to be exchanged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the rumor of the Masters Association."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, Siegel, I have an old bone. Now there is no plan to fight the dragon, so I won't take you away." The wizard wizard said: "It's better than we put How does the research team put in the city of Mire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a worse idea, Siegel thought. Study how to deal with your own spell organization in your own territory? After Siegel, he could not pick up the hat of the "traitor." Knox is an enemy, but it is still part of the Masters Federation. The elves are in a state of war with humans. The army of the siege is evidence. Although many local lords have reached an agreement with the elves in exchange for peace within a certain degree, they are secretly carried out and will never be placed in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the rules of the game between human aristocrats, and everyone abides by and maintains order in the open world. In this game, there is only the difference between a smart person and a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the wizard's wizards are coming, my Heim collar is actually occupied." Siegel shook his head, "unless the war is over, the elves Stop the occupation of Deepwater City and Heim, otherwise there is nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why add Deepwater City?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel replied: "I am the pioneer of the Deepwater City, the baronial title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rikapa Shooting the thighs seems to have just thought of it. "It doesn't work either, it won't work either. Siegel, do you first talk about whether there is any further information on the red minaret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel just thought Shake his head. Mixing this up, I heard a sound floating in the air. "He has, the Masters Association is willing to help in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-evil Master Idis’s virtual image projection appears in midair, respectfully Kappa sergeant, then said: "Respected sage ** division, I received the latest news, Knox Association has been listed as an extremely dangerous organization by the Masters Association, and asked the Masters Association to immediately strip it And carry out overnight and recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
