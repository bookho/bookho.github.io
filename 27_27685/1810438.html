			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the war in the north, many things need to be decided, so the meeting time is much longer than the plan. When the West Siegel Squid came to the restaurant, the first dish of dinner, a pot of pumpkin and sweet soup with cinnamon and honey, had already been removed from the table. Isaac was boring with a fork on the white intestine in the plate, and pierced the casing. The thick white intestine lying on the plate was stained with a yellow-brown sweet mustard, like a big snake knocked down on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am late, our great swordsman is tired of the enemy and starts to abuse food." Siegel patted his son behind his head. A slap, then slammed his equally black hair. "Let you wait a long time, what is left in the pot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet adjusted the cushion behind her body to make herself as comfortable as possible Some, with a smile to Siegel said: "There should be a lot of white intestines, enough for you to eat. To white bread or rye bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Salty oatmeal bread. I have been eating elf biscuits for a while, and I haven't eaten hard things for a long time." Siegel took the white sausage from the plate and gently placed it on the plate. It is reasonable to say that you need to remove the casing first, or cut into pieces and then peel. The Marquis thought about it, took it directly with his hand, licked it into the sauce, and bit it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac grinned and saw his father wink at him, so he put the fork down and grabbed it and stuffed it into his mouth. However, his white sausage casing was full of holes, and it was broken under a violent force. The boy was busy catching up. What rules can be negotiated at home, but you can't waste food, you can't bully others with things you don't want. It's a rule that you can't break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son, the rules of etiquette are to be learned, but what should be done from the etiquette. You must also know." Siegel took another one after eating one. root. " Eat well, sleep well, have fun and study hard. This is what you need to do now. When you grow up, you don't have this kind of preferential treatment. The order of these things will change. Tonight is early." Sleep. I will take you to hunting tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isac suddenly picked up from the chair and shouted: "Really?! Not allowed "Cheat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think of using a gun, you can only use a bow and a sword!" Siegel smiled and watched him play, then said: "I Take you to a new place, you have to be obedient, can't run around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy is excited, what conditions can be promised at this time. Janet smiled and looked at her son, but looked at Siegel with worried eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows her husband very well. Usually, in addition to work is learning, what time is there to play? Being able to take time out to play with his son means that he will do important things right away and will leave his son and his side for a long time. It is very likely that he will leave the Heim collar this time, because if he is staying in the castle, he will always be able to come out to accompany his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening when two people were alone, Janet did not wait for Siegel’s opening and asked. She knew that Siegel would say sooner or later, but that would give him a time of grief and uncomfortable. Why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do this time?" Janet stroking her belly in her pajamas and asking, "How long will it take? Is the child coming back before birth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure." Siegel said: "This time is different from the past. I need your help very much. Although I left, but I left, but I want to make the illusion that I am still in Heim. I will say that I am studying closed high spells and trying to break through the limitations of legendary spells. Only you know that even Isaac can't tell him the truth." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have become a sergeant, can't you hide your whereabouts? With the help of spells, who else can follow you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not a sergeant, if you haven’t made some breakthroughs in the study of legendary spells, I’m afraid I don’t know that there are so many tracking spells in my body.” Siegel Two smiles, said: "Remember the transmission method that the Elf Saints helped to establish. It can be achieved across the continent. The one that was transmitted instantaneously. I looked for the opportunity to dismantle the circle and discover the rune features of some legendary spells. These seeds include transmissions, messages, and prophecies. I found the corresponding positioning part in myself. In this way, the genius can concentrate on the service for me; it is the same reason. The sacred sage can know where I am by exerting some magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
