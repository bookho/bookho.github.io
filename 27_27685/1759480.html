			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was sent to a thin young man, about twenty years old, with dark brown hair and peasant rags. This is not a knight's material. He looks down on solid armor and can't dance a heavy sword. But his body is strong and his eyes are very smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Patrick Lester of the Leicester family in Gascote, this letter is my brother, the current Lord of Gascoal, Baron Brown He wrote with confidence: "The Sergeant Siegel, we are very admired for your record in the afternoon. I have been able to reverse the growth and decline of frontline morale. But this is not enough to change the direction of the war. There must be another action. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel opened the letter, the letter was not signed, but simply stated some circumstances. A ceremony to pray to the god of warriors will be held, when the siege weapons camp will be taken over by the soldiers of the Leicester family, where there will be bright lights and no defense. The Baron Brown hinted at Siegel, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Without the help of siege weapons, the coalition forces will lose hope of breaking the wall, and at this stage no one wants to waste too much force on climbing the wall. He also revealed that since the siege of this period, the food and supplies of the coalition forces have been reduced very fast, and many small lords have been somewhat tight, and they have the idea of ​​retreating. Only one or two leaders are needed, and the coalition forces will not fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to show sincerity, I will stay as a hostage." Patrick said: "Brown Baron is very much looking forward to meeting you, of course I am referring to the end of the war. Later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan is very good, and the timing is even more rare." Siegel repeatedly read the letter and said: "But this can't explain why." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Viscount Uther is my brother's father-in-law, and William Uther is intimate with our brothers." Patrick explained: "We practice swords together, Trained together, the two families have always had a close relationship. The Viscounts have long chosen to avoid this battle, and warned us not to try to touch the land that Heim led, compared with the so-called benefits, the price is too great. William also He said that he was here, although he was captured. But after giving compensation to the merchant’s will, he was not treated harshly. For this, our brothers paid tribute and thought that you are a Aristocratic temperament. Can believe The lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and pinched the letter still asking: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Patrick smiled and explained to him: "Heam's collar is good, but there is only one castle, and it is too far away from our Fort Gaco. Although the gold mine can get good returns, the land is fundamental. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a big lord in the South who can stand firm, and the number of castles in each family is mostly one or two. When there are two or three outstanding offspring in the family, there are not enough territories to give them. One way out to solve this situation in the kingdom of stars is to marry and gradually close the castles of the descendant family, which is an effective means of becoming a big lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the marriage is not suitable for the New World, so there is only one war left. Seeing Patrick, Siegel took the letter and solemnly collected it and said to him with a smile: "The Leicester family is in the snow, and we sincerely thank you. Before the end of the battle. Please rest in peace here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick stunned, waiting for the servant to lead him to the rest room. Siegel summoned Moore to come over, but when Patrick turned around, he recited a curse. A strong sense of sleepiness enveloped the brave messenger, and he rocked two times and fell to the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gestures to everyone to be quiet, and then puts his palms over Patrick’s head. The letterhead sent by the Baron Brown is a huge honey, but is there any packaged poison? Siegel uses the power of magic to penetrate Patrick's mind and constantly search for his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the means of the Knox Association, which is considered a taboo for evil in the eyes of the general mages. After being merged into the Mage Federation, Knox promised not to use this spell again, and it seemed to converge a lot. In the general case. Siegel will naturally not use this spell, but it is now a time of engagement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick’s memories are mostly about learning, training, and thinking about war. Their family has always been very religious to the god of warriors, so there will be excellent men in every generation. This zone is especially fortunate, both Brown and Patrick have the ability to manage and develop territories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing here, Siegel still did not stop, continue to increase the power of the spell, and continue to dig deep. Patrick trembled under the influence of magic, and his eyes turned up, and the white foam squeezed out of his mouth. Elinette reached out and tried to interrupt Siegel’s spell, but the Master’s lord snorted: “Don’t worry, it’s almost worse!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He explored the more vocal parts and saw a vague figure. The long red dress shows that she is a girl, maybe a lady of a certain family. Patrick loves her very much, and this trip may not have the idea of ​​becoming the lord. But why this woman's face can't be seen clearly, which is contrary to common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relationship is so incomparably fast, just like falling in love at first sight. Siegel laughed at himself, he didn't think so, but unlike Patrick, he would never remember Janet's appearance. He perceives the problem, so he controls the spell more intensively, and follows this clue to find out the clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Patrick decided to sell the coalition to Heim, the woman had appeared and had talks with him. The conversation was ambiguous and seemed to have been overshadowed by the spell. The letter was indeed written by Baron Brown, but the idea of ​​a raid on the siege camp was not the "original" of the Leicester family. The taste of this conspiracy is very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel raised his hand and no longer used the spell to torture the poor man. "Let him go back to the room to rest, he said that he accidentally fell, I said that I apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol nodded, taking Patrick off Janet asked: "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox will set up a trap, and there will be ambushes in siege weapons construction camps. Siegel said: "At least one other sorcerer is hidden in the opposite side, using the means of magic to influence the mind of the southern lords. It seems that today my appearance and Felton's death disrupted their plans and lost their reliance on siege." The weapon can take down the confidence of the city, so come up with such a big bait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do we change the plan?" Elinte asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Must be modified." Siegel said to Janet: "Patrick is a big gift, he can prove a lot of things. Edith Master And his apprentices have been hiding in Heim for a long time, I should visit them again. Let Duke prepare to temporarily take over the defense of the Striped Mountain Fortress; order Mana to prepare for the cavalry attack. Read more horses, Let the dwarf follow up too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Eileen and said: "This is a dangerous task, you need to fast forward and fast, so the horse is essential. I hope that the dwarves will be competent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene snorted two times and replied: "Even if it is tied to the horse. We will also complete the mission!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf wizard Idis and his several apprentices have been under the spell test tower, placing a strong hidden and defensive enchantment in front of the door to prevent unintentional Close to. These techniques didn't make much difference to the Master. He quickly read the spell he was fighting for and passed layers of protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the hovering underground staircase, I came to the copying room. Several mages are here to sort out the damaged books and fix the already vague words. This is a very important job, only those who have a wealth of knowledge and knowledge of all kinds of spells and magic arrays. The half-elf Idis looked up from the back of a heavy book, and the true lens on the bridge of the nose reflected the light of the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are back." Idis took a pen. His voice is a little hoarse. It seems that I have not spoken for a long time, and I feel very uncomfortable. "It is said that your delivery spell has gone wrong. Where did you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel didn't want the other party to master today's topic, he had very little time Convince several mages. "My territory is under attack. Among them are the sorcerers of the Knox Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about that?" Idis said: " You have long doubted Knox, which is why Lord Faranes has set up the library here. During the absence of you, the defense of the castle is doing very well. I believe that you can take a step after you return. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time the Southern Lords Coalition was organized by the Knox Association, a wizard who is proficient in metamorphosis. And now the other There are still sorcerers lurking in the battle, planning a conspiracy to destroy the Heim collar.” Siegel said: “I am just a mage. How many enemies can I deal with? When the wall is destroyed, the building inside is not perfect. Farah Didn't Mr. Nice let me face the regular Knox Association alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
