			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was late in the evening, Moore asked the guards of the castle, only to know that they had been allowed to meet with Viscount Pran. When two people don't want to delay their time, they have to guard the pass and then walk straight in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower where the Lord lived was originally called the Watchtower, and now it is called the Light Tower because it is the only inhabited tower nearby. Inside is a well-ventilated hall, which is affected by the terrain. There is a breeze blowing all the year round, so it is not as humid as the outside. There are six huge fireplaces on the wall, one for every ten bricks, and it must be very warm when it is all lit. Now, except for the one closest to the lord, the other fireplaces are all extinguished, and the cold dust floats like feathers under the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four spear guards in short cloaks guard the gates and the viscounts of Pran, who are dining, the owners here are sitting behind a huge board table Filled with food. When the Viscount was about forty years old, when he was full of energy, although he was not tall, he moved quickly and quickly, and chewed quickly when he was eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Honourable Prang, the Lord of the Lord." After the approach, Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sit, take the plate to the guests and pour the wine.” The eyes of the princes of Pran are grayish white, like the sand mixed with milk, which looks a bit muddy. . His voice was short and powerful, slightly hoarse: "I haven't seen the knight outside for a long time, eh? I heard that it is Heim, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I am the free agent Soss from Heim, this is my attendant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount is facing the cheese and bread on the table. Cold meat and fruit made a gesture, then raised his own cup: "I hope that my food here will satisfy you, but do you want to drink red wine or white wine? I am fed up with local mushroom honey, but If you want it, I have it here too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to help you out, so try the mushroom honey. My companion needs some water or Milk can be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it’s still a doll." The Viscount inserted a piece of ham and stuffed it into his mouth before he greeted the servant and said, "Give The Ress Knight poured a glass of mushroom wine and gave the child some water. The action is quick!” He turned to Siegel and said to him: Do you know how the sheep that eat mushrooms will end? They basically don't produce milk! So you only have to wean and drink water. Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;西格The face was expressionless, but the servant who came to the food nodded slightly. Mol, who was ridiculed, said nothing, and his hand slammed his fist under the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the drink came up, the lord waved. Signal everyone to leave. The servant quietly and quickly evacuated, and the guards only had one at the door. Viscount Pran leaned back on the back of the chair, with a knife hanging down in his hand, chewing on the meat in his mouth while staring at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taste the ham. It is a local pig that grows up with mushrooms and tastes very different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took a bite and didn't make any difference. "The Viscount Puland, as far as I know, the pig does not eat mushrooms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled softly. "You know, since our family has occupied this wasteland, there are a lot of rumors outside. Mushrooms raise pigs, mushrooms feed sheep, and even our chickens eat mushrooms to lay eggs." He picked up a piece of yogurt. The mouth swallowed and then poured a red wine. "You are very interesting, some minds, and don't brag about shooting horses. What do people like you do to our corners?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lord Siegel The baron has a task assigned to me, come here to find a mage called Meg, and take back a book belonging to the Mage Federation in her hand." Siegel calmly opened the bread and placed it on the plate, plus A few pieces of ham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also want to know where she is, so I can hang her by hand." The lord replied: "I used to have a good weather here, and suddenly I was damned." The fog is shrouded. It is the problem of the abominable woman. The damn mage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She escaped? Hidden?" Siegel decided to force the lord To the corner, "Do you need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery City does not need us two for the time being. The Southern Allied Forces have been defeated and the castle that surrendered to the Lord has settled down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I heard Your thing." Viscount Prande threw away the knife: "Is this all the Master? Do you have magical evils, how can you have knighthood and honor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My lord is a knight with honor." Siegel took an apple. Use your fingers to open it, throw the half of the core to the side, and then look at your plate satisfactorily. "The lords of the South have not tried their best. They have smashed their blood in the castle of my house, and they have lost their helmets. They only hope that they will not be stupid and hopeless. They can also learn some lessons."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a threat, I understand it in the heart of the Principal, but he does not eat this. He raised the cup and shouted: "Let's cheer, for victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to win." Siegel please take a sip, full of sweet mouths the taste of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...the Knight is here, I am in a remote place, and a lot of news is heard. Your lord is said to be small?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coming soon, and he has just become a father, gave birth to a small lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this It’s a good thing, but the news is good.” “It’s bad news for me, I want to marry my daughter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is something wrong, but this should not affect the friendship between the two lords," Siegel said: "The baron would be very grateful for your help in this event of finding lost and lost."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help?" Viscount Pran shrugged and said indifferently: "What can he give me? I am poor, but I don’t want to eat or drink, no one will Interested in land. I don't need his gold, he doesn't need my mushroom. A mage who is a sailor is still honest about his own life. Don't run around. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Baron is indeed not running, because he knows that if he runs around, the whole South will be alarmed." Siegel smiled, "Uther And the South Army, can not support more than one day in front of him, he really should not run."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you threatening me?" The plate creaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am telling the truth." Siegel raised the cup and drank a sip of honey: "It’s another way to threaten others with us. For example, send a poet to the enemy hall to sing "One Day War." But you can rest assured that my nephew is very bad and will not sing that song. As I said when I first came, we are looking for it. People, looking for books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As I said earlier, Meg can't find it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint smile is always on Siegel’s lips: "If it is an ordinary lord, he will accept your words and then leave with disappointment. But my master is not, he said that McGonagall Here, that must be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him find it himself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Are you sure, Lord lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countman's nose snorted and touched his moustache, and the gray eyes flickered. After a while, he shouted: "People! Come up the barbecue, how are you eating some cool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant hurriedly opened the door Put a large piece of roasted horse meat with a bloody red inside the skin and put it in front of everyone, then quit in a panic. This time, Count Pran waved his hand and even the guards at the door were withdrawn. There were only three people left in the big room, standing by the fireplace that was about to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bill Siegel wants a book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, McGonagall The mage borrowed a book from the federation, "The Moonlight Moya Vol.", which has not been returned. The teacher of the Siegel Baron asked him to retrieve the book, so he sent me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the book used for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
