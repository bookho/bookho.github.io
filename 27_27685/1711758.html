			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our purpose is not to destroy the orcs, but to make them feel pain." The three lords glanced at each other and seemed to have reached an agreement, so they sat on the left The mask man said: "We already know the location of the port of the Orc Island. They built nine shipyards and built warships on the 'Macabu' day and night. We hope that with the help of the Mage Federation, Can destroy this port and destroy the orc's water army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion looked at William Eric, who nodded. The travel mages knew the geography and terroir of the New World. He took out his staff and waved it. A flash of dust fluttered in the air and then aggregated into a picture showing the northern landscape. On this map, the mountains, rivers, vegetation and towns are marked, and one of the towns on the coastline is shining - there is Macabu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes flashed and he tried to remember the entire map in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macabu 嗒 means the end of the Heihe River, just at the exit of the Heihe River Gorge, only to climb over the mountains to reach from the land. In Deepwater City and Macabu Between the hustle and bustle, there are four large savage tribes and three orc town-level strongholds, roughly estimated that there are 70,000 enemies blocking this route. The savage totem will interfere with the magical effect, while the orc's witchcraft is around Energy fluctuations are very sensitive, especially for spells such as transmission and flight. It is easy to stun the snake and lead the army to round up." William sergeant pointed at the map and explained, finally he concluded: "You can only go over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, can't you go from the sea?" Lion King asked. He turned his eyes to the lord and asked them for their opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s hard to do." The lord said in a heavy tone: "Deepwater City has not enough warships to attack Macabu, we plan to go to the kingdom of stars." Help. This will make us pay a very high price, but it is better than sitting in a city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Masters Federation still hopes the status of the current self-governing territories in Sham Shui Po No change," Alexander said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an agreement between the Lords and the Masters Federation, which will be followed. Similarly, we require the use of the Federation’s transmission matrix to quickly travel to the stars. Country. There we will launch allies and form a fleet as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The transmission matrix is ​​waiting for the arrival of the messenger, we will be prepared in advance. But remember, no armed forces can use the transmission matrix, which is the bottom line that cannot be crossed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords nodded and said compliance, so this became The agreement reached between the two parties. Siegel highlighted the relevant sentences in the sheepskin rolls and presented them to the mentors and lords. After that, the two sides fell into a short silence, leaving only the ticking of the water timer and the roar of firewood burning in the fireplace. Dr. Faranisbo writhed his body in the chair and yawned, finally opening his eyes for a long time. He frowned, his eyes swept across everyone's face, and then said to the lords: "Don't waste time, hurry to say important things. Now our federation and Deepwater City are allies that help each other, so don't circle. Even with the fleet, the raid of Macabu is more like a desperate attempt. What about the orcs on the land of the North?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords Get up, deep, and then said: "Deepwater City will dispatch the elite of the guards, under the leadership of the bloody knight Count Maxim, from the land to the end of the Heihe River, waiting for the opportunity to burn the entire port. We need The Mage Federation provides guidance and assistance, and draws the attention of the orc army on the sea and on the land to make the raids successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a stupid plan, But not desperate.” Ba Xueshi said: “The real enemy is still hidden behind the scenes, counting the chips in hand, measuring the win or lose, he has already taken the lead. Your plan is full of loopholes, but there is a benefit. - He will paralyze the enemy's wariness and breed his pride. And pride will make him lose the victory. The bloody knight is proficient in warfare, cautious and tough, and is a man who can be entrusted; the colleagues and students of the federation have not been good for a long time. The practical opportunity, this time just to go to the front line to see. Everything is just beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your support, your bachelor's degree." The lords again bow. "If a mage can fight an orc, our chances of winning are greatly increased. So please let Sham Shui Po be responsible for recruiting the fees that the Master will follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Master Alexander I exchanged my eyes with Faranis, confirmed my opinion through my heart, and then agreed. But he turned to the lords to ask the question: "What is your schedule?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is for the deep water city." The lords finally added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will follow the fleet action." Travel Master William said: "I just need to go out to sea once, and even the transportation is saved." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will prepare the best big ship for you," said the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"painting the sails in purple," said the travel mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the lords have things to do, we will not waste time." The lion stood up and spread his hands to the lords, then Said: "We will start to work on the agreement reached this time, I hope that magic is always there, and victory is always there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords nodded and then left the venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel recorded the parchment and respectfully placed it on the table. He felt pressure in front of the three sergeants, and even if he didn't look up, he could feel three eyes watching himself. He stepped back from the house but was stopped when he approached the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, Siegel." Speaking is the bachelor of Faranisbo. Siegel looked up and found the old man looking at him with ease, and a pair of blue eyes fainted under the fire. “Do you like to learn magic?” he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, magic is very interesting." Siegel replied immediately, without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very talented, I heard some colleagues mentioned you, 'The fastest person to become an apprentice mage.' They said that you only spent two months Studying the salon has mastered simple magic. I have to ask which teachers teach the class, such a good teaching effect will affect the income of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lion The king nodded aside and echoed: "I also feel the need to raise the price of the charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William-Eric shook his mouth with his fist and coughed twice Your own smile. He turned to Siegel in a gentle tone: "You can wear a blue robe very quickly, which is the advice of Lord Faranes. The Federation has always supported promising students to help them grow. But you also need to know You become a trainee in advance to give you access to a wider range of spells, but there are also requirements - you need to exceed the standard of the trainee in one year, or you will be taken away from the blue robe."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Faranis narrowed his eyes, his hands could not help but squeeze the staff, very nervous. He stared at Siegel, staring at his lips and concentrating on what he was going to say next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do to quickly increase my spell power?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only practice." The bachelor's degree relaxes and then answers. "Just like a warrior is constantly waving a long sword, the wizard is just another user of power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, trainee, continue learning Don't waste your life with a few old people," said Lion King Alexander. In saying this, the travel magi William shook his head and shook his head, very disapproving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can retire." Bo Xueshi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel once again bowed, quietly exited the room and closed the door. After a short silence, the three mages exchanged their eyes. Alexander first asked: "Master Faranes, are you sure this person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachelor frowned, hesitated, then nodded slowly. He said: "The future is made up of countless pasts. Even God can hardly peek into the future. I just saw some fragmented fragments in the illusion, but the child did give me a familiar feeling. In the future, he will pursue strength and take the initiative to go to the north to make the king appear there and change the situation of the northern orcs. So the federation will not suffer a major disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But even if you fail, you have not foreseen the destruction of the federation?" Alexander is always full of confidence, so he said: "The disaster is nothing, I believe that only after the hardships of the predicament can grow. No matter the future How the river flows, always rely on yourself to swim forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
