			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern continent has appeared at the end of the field of vision, replacing the scene of the heavens and the sea, and has become the starting point of the dawn of the sun every day. The star number stopped, and since she still did not receive a reply from King Avon, she only stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a distance of 1200 miles from the coast to the Star City, but it is actually not far from the Stars. If you use a virtual cannon, Star King is already in the attack range. Because of his anxiety, Siegel has always had this idea in his mind. He knows that this is not good, but after things involve Sir Bill, he is hard to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cliff shaped like a three-headed snake on the shore in front of it, especially the prominent land in the middle, deep into the ocean. The three cliffs sandwich two canyons, one of which is sheltered from the wind and sheltered from the tide all year round, so it has become a good harbor. It is said that an earthquake three hundred years ago caused such a spectacle. From that time on, it was called Qiya City. Once sporadic fishermen were fishing in the fast-flowing harbors, they are now an important transportation hub between the two continents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has recently become a royal territory. At the suggestion of Siegel, Evan replaced the land in the pocket of the royal family through the replacement of the territory. Now the exotic goods from the New World and the vast amount of cheap manufacturing materials are used to land here through the transatlantic transport array and then transported to all parts of the Star Kingdom. After this, the steel purchase price of the Star Royal Family has dropped to 20% in the past, and how much is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords of the Eastern Continent love and hate here, and the same feelings for Siegel. Generally speaking, the Sergeant Siegel has a high position and no heavy weight. There is no complicated background and family entanglement. The mana is strong and the territory is rich. It should be the object of the various lords. Unfortunately, his industrial production capacity is too strong, has seriously interfered with the economics of each territory, so the lords hate him and think that he is a nouveau riche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in Siegel’s view, this is already a fair evaluation. There are many more rumors than this ugly one, such as the kid who made a fortune to dig a tomb. Together with the barbarians, they robbed the robbers of Deepwater City and so on. Well-informed people already know that this upstart kid robber has approached the East Continent and hopes to meet with His Majesty the King. They can't be stupid enough to call them a nouveau robber, but only Mr. Siegel Squid. Heim leads the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A southern merchant ship that passed through the Xingsuo to Qiya City was stopped by Siegel. When he heard that it was going to stay in the port for about ten days, Siegel hired him with fifty gold coins to do one thing: send a daily round-trip message to the shore to find out when the spacecraft can continue on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four days, finally got good news. A speedboat full of white sails approached the star with the banner of the starry royal family. Then docked next to it, and Siegel used the suspension ladder to pick up the messenger. The person who came was about forty years old, with a mustache on his thin face and a pale yellow blouse. He was also unlucky, and he showed a scroll and read:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allow the Marquis of Siegel Squid to come to see you. I wish the journey safe and everything goes smoothly. King of the Stars of the Stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, took the reel and asked, "I don't know your name yet?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly waved his hand and said modestly: "The Marquis is an adult, but you can’t let you use it. It’s just a little royal baron, I received yours. The letter happened to be next to you. His Majesty sent two messengers, all the way to the city of Mire by the transmission array, the other is me, waiting near the coastline. Because of the long coastline, it took a few days to find you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To count the time, the person who took the transmission array should have arrived in the city of Mire, and the reply should be able to return to Qiya City on the same day. It’s the earliest plan to stay in the vicinity of Qiya City, Janet and others know. There is no reason to let this guy who wanders around the coastline find himself first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the hard work, I am going to see you. Mr. Baron, are you with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my long-cherished wish to visit this magical spaceship. I did not expect that I am so honored." Baron Peters gathered deeply: "I am willing to walk with you. I am happy to be you." "The guide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. My bodyguard will take you on a tour. Please understand that I am still working on a boat and I am missing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Federation provided two magical spaceships to the kingdom of the stars, more than a dozen mages were left as royal mages to manipulate the two ships. They know more about the situation in the kingdom and they will not betray their colleagues in the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel never imagined that it was her. The chief nephew of the Necromancer, Shelley, came to the Xingsuo from Qiya City with flying, and greeted Siegel with a rare smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unexpectedly, I didn't expect to alarm you." Siegel rushed to salute. "I thought it would be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think, it's impossible for Wendy to come over, you think too much." Shelley waved his hand, first I took a sip of Siegel. "The original federation was to send a royal mage. It seems to me to be a shit. It is better to find a consultant in the school. How can I say that I am also a countess, although there is no territory, it is not comparable to your mage. The title of the lord, but still knows a little about the kingdom's nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel knows the character of Master Shelley, if it is not well-informed, she is I won't say a little about it. This is also better, more familiar and more trustworthy, and the title of the Countess is easier to open up in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before, I think you are very smart. Why do you have to take a little girl who can't magic? Wendy is not good, huh?" Snow Lai Yuzui: "But this time, I heard about your reaction. I know that this is not what your head thinks. It must be the idea of ​​your wife. In this respect, she is still useful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation can always put Wendy in front of Siegel, and only the Shelley Master is left. Siegel’s face was stunned and he shook his head. "Don't always say this thing. This time it's really hard for you, just run with me. Have you been busy becoming a sergeant recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After Wendy, Wywood, and Simonton became **, everyone thought that the next sergeant would be in the Necromancer. Shelley has been a high-ranking mage for many years and has been lacking the opportunity to master space and time spells. The meditation of the astral projection and the demonstration of Siegel have helped a lot, but she always seems to be a little worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Necromancer is different from you, and it is more focused on the use of negative energy than on the four basic elements. Although the Necromancer is still the standard of the sorcerer. It is a space lock and an eternal static spell, but it really needs to break through in terms of negative energy. Do you have any thoughts on this aspect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual There is indeed. Cloning is a Necromancer spell. Although it uses a lot of life energy, that is, positive energy, it is still essentially manipulating the body and letting a certain host survive. But this spell has not been tested successfully, and Siegel does not want to disclose it for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another famous sorcerer-level necromancer spell is a star-shaped projection, the body is suspended, and the mind is isolated, which is the means of the dead spirit. For this spell, Siegel can tell her all the thoughts, and there is no new experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... I am not a wishing god, what is there for what." Siegel thought of cloning and youthful medicine, and said: "The only one at the moment." A little experience is that life and death are not opposites, but mutual transformation. The power of life and the power of death can coexist and even integrate harmoniously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just kidding, how is this possible?" Master Shelley shook his head and said no, "I just opened a few jokes. You used this gibberish to smother me. You are so bad! Either live or die." How can we coexist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All things are three, life and death should be no exception. Besides, I don't think the undead creature should be the third." Siegel only Can be here, the rest can not take her to completely learn the cloning spell, he has not yet stereotyped this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, well, even if you use delusions to inspire thinking." Master Shelley habitually grinned: "I came to work." Now, I will give you directions. Do you want to go directly to the Star King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to delay for a moment." Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shelley Master used illusion to present a map on the deck, with all the mountains, rivers, and lords' territories being very accurately marked. "The other maps of the kingdom are not accurate. I also saw it from the Williams. How high can your magic spaceship fly? If the seven kilometers is no problem, it is the fastest route to cross the Griffin Mountains. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
