			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal only lasted for a short while, but it was enough to bring Siegel and Erdu back to the material world. The shock wave caused by the huge explosion behind him followed the two men into the portal. Fortunately, the passage quickly closed, leaving the power of destruction in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men rolled into a ball and fell into the dark warehouse. The shelves were knocked down, and alchemy and casting materials lingered on two people. The konjac kept screaming "哎呦, 哎呦", he tried to support it with slender arms and legs, but was pushed back to the ground by the more flexible Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage stood up and the light from the wand illuminated the surroundings. He was delighted to discover that it was his own repository of spell materials, the basement of the city of Mith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally back." He stretched out the konjac and looked around. There is a lot of dust on the ground and on the shelves, indicating that no one has cleaned it, and it has been a long time. Thinking of this, his inner joy was diluted a lot. It is difficult to calculate time in the void, and many times he will be immersed in the manufacture of meditation and magic array. How long has it been? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel closes his eyes and communicates his own magical pets. Raven Barron sent excitement and joy from the soul connection, and then handed over control. Siegel saw Janet lying in bed through the eyes of the magic pet. It seems that she is so weak, her face is unhealthy. Her belly is round and her clothes are raised high. It seems that it has been at least five or six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I can catch up with my child’s birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon girl pushed open the door, coming in with anger from the outside, complaining that the attacking army actually began to assemble again, and there was no plan to rest at all. She persuaded Janet to enter the secret passage as soon as possible so that she could recover the real body and let the outside army know what the wrath of the dragon is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned and angered, and there was an army that dared to attack its territory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to the two women in the bedroom through the mouth of the magic pet, "I am back, you can rest assured. Give it to me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel?!" Janet screamed. The magic pet nodded and then cut off contact with his master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn snoring with her nose, she found a strange transmission spell structure, secretly surprised. I did not expect to follow this black hair mage. I can see so many special spells, maybe the hope of finding my father is hidden here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two slap, you stay here and hide, wait for me to finish and arrange for you again." Siegel said: "There is a fight outside, you don't want to Go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac nodded. Then watched Siegel walk to the door. The door lock opens automatically and silently leaves the road for him. The elemental energy around the mage was quickly mobilized and concentrated on his wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person cannot change the situation of war unless he has endless magic to use. Siegel took the silver from the space bag and pulled them into filaments with a spell, one end wrapped around the wand and the other end made into a claw shape that could be opened and closed. Then Siegel used the method learned from the Nethers to learn the rune lines on the silver claws, and with the elements of the rune array and the energy focusing lens, made a "charger" for his wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a piece of inflammatory soul crystal. Then inserted into the modified wand claws. The energy of the soul crystal is transformed and decomposed into a form of elemental energy that can be utilized by the wand. Originally, Siegel needed to use his own body to carry the surge of magical energy, reconstructing these energies with his own thoughts, in order to form a spell, which was launched through the wand. Now he only needs to take the last two steps, greatly reducing the burden on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, he can release more magic - although control will be affected and reduced, the number will undoubtedly increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coming out of the warehouse, many residents of Heim’s collar saw him. These refugees have been evading attacks in the underground of the castle for three days. In the past three days, all the men have been sent to the wall to take turns to deal with the enemy's repeated attacks. There are only old people, women and children in the basement. They are leaning against each other, lowering their voices and comforting each other. A half-elf priest is standing among them. Holding up the sacred emblem of silver, leading the people to pray together to the Mother of the Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next level is the warehouse and the secret road. The above does not allow civilians to appear. At most, some people who know how to dress up wounds and deliver food can come up and look at the situation while working. The armory is also here, four blacksmiths are busy, two people try to polish the long sword with a gap or blunt, and the other two are busy dealing with the broken shield. The enemy's arrows are endless, shields and helmets are very important, and they are life-critical things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the house, the dwarf's perseverance runestone floats in the air, providing power to the people here. Here you can quickly restore your strength and have a very good soothing effect on muscle pain caused by fatigue. Some half-orcs leaned against the corner of the wall, accompanied by the slamming of the blacksmith, and fell asleep, and the huge snoring sounds. They all had large and small wounds on their bodies. The bandages that had been wrapped around them had been soaked in sweat, turned grey, and then stood on new blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are either focused on the work in their hands, or still in the dream, Siegel stood in front of them for a while without notice. The guards who guarded the entrance to the secret passage stunned and hurriedly stood up, causing the horned helmet on his head to continually sway. He is just a child of ten years old, barely able to hold a spear and put on a helmet. There is no training in martial arts at all, and there is not enough strength, but it can help guard the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord...you are back!" The child has a happy face: "I have been working hard to stand guard, no moment to be lazy!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled, took a cat's eye from the space bag and put it in his palm, then said: "Continue to work hard, this is my reward for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a reward, and the child was encouraged. So he boldly said: "The Lord Lord, the Knight of Mana is resting not far away, do you want me to You call her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her keep up, I am waiting for you here," Siegel replied: "Go back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shooter is exhausted, but after seeing Siegel, there is an unstoppable excitement in his eyes. For a moment, Siegel seemed to see the tears in her eyes. "I am back," Siegel said. "I won't let you fight alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Lord Lord, we are always together." Showing a pale smile, "Everyone fought side by side from the beginning and took turns to rest. I just went down to sleep for a while, with Leah leading the archers and Zucker commanding the wall defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" While walking with me, tell me what happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lords of the South suddenly gathered together and declared war on us. When the letter of war was sent to the castle, the army had already traveled halfway. Mrs. Janet could only let all the residents of the territory retreat to the castle to escape from the war."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The siege has been going on for five days, and three days ago they started an uninterrupted attack, trying to use the tired strategy to drag them. So far, with the help of the runes and territories on the walls Elemental warrior, the situation is temporarily able to remain stalemate, but from In short, the other party still has obvious advantages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is surrounded by layers, there is no news outside, so who is planning?" The attack is still unknown," Mana said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked up the stairs, and everyone let the road open and salute to Siegel. Some people sang the songs of the "One-Day War," and then the people they heard sang along. This is their wish to end the war in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Siegel has heard the song, and I have to say that some of the passages are quite catchy. But behind this relaxed and enjoyable piece of music, it is a heavy responsibility and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed Mana to the courtyard and saw the half-orc, who was resting here. He tied the wound on his leg with a bandage and then proudly extended it to the front of the statue. The clay giant swept from above with his big hand and covered the wound with milky white light. Although it does not heal quickly, it can speed up recovery and prevent infection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Zucker, more than 20 half-orc warriors are treating each other. They cleaned the wound with spirits and stitched them with long needles burnt. Although behind the city wall, it is still in the battlefield, and there will be arrows falling from time to time. So the recommended shacks were built with wood in the courtyard, at least blocking the flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
