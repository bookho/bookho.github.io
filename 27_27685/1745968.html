			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remains of the past villages remain on the rift, and a run-down inn is crumbling on the edge of the cliff. The lime-painted walls have long since turned into dark colors, and the cracked windows are empty like a blind eye. There was a sign hanging on the door, but now there is only a rusty piece of iron, which makes a harsh rubbing sound in the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guides sent by the Hugel family are at the forefront. They collect drugs and catch snakes in this area, so it is very clear where they can pass. Behind them are the three-row team, the spearmen and the scorpion shooters wearing simple leather armor, nervously watching the deep cliffs at their feet. From time to time, strange noises came from the cliffs. The fluttering fireflies were like ghost eyes, looking up from the deep hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The speed of advancement is still somewhat slow." Viscount Dray rode on the horse, said to his loyalty knight, Matt Williams. "Can you pass this rift before dawn? I want to see the wall of the city of Mith at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt snorted and replied: "I Will let the guides speed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Drey nod nodded. The passage in the Rift Valley is the most dangerous part of the entire march, and there is no way to expand formation, whether it is forward or backward. Therefore, he sent a sublime second son, William, to lead the cavalry troops to attack the striped mountain gold mine, in order to attract the sight of the young lord. A lucky boy, the viscount thought, hoping that he would surrender and hand over the territory this time, so that he would keep his life. In some ways, he still likes the lord called Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned from the members of the "Freedom Knights" who were released that they failed. Since the plan was discovered and there was no plan to retreat, the whole army was not surprised. Viscount Dray admired Siegel's mind, and he was smart enough as a young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the Viscount must choose to attack at this time. When the construction of the city of Mith was completed, the clever Sergeant Siegel was even more difficult to defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is dangerous, but fortunately it will soon reach the end. The Viscount Drey has seen the rolling hills in the distance, where he has been looking forward to the wide and wide soil of. The last darkness before dawn began to dissipate. A faint dark red glow looms from the eastern horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day and night march is not in vain, it only takes another half an hour, and when all the teams step on the dwarf, they can start to rest. Although the relaxation time of an hour seems to be a drop in the bucket. But it is enough for the soldiers to boost morale, at least when they appear under the city of Mire, it will not appear exhausted and without threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a shadow of riding a horse climbed the dwarf, and the red cloak was very close to the color of the eastern sun. The prince of Dray had a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, one shadow after another stood on the low hill. In two columns, there are about forty. At this time, the rising sun crossed the earth's occlusion, and the golden light dispelled the last remaining darkness between heaven and earth. The archers trained by Siegel and Mana stood on the low hills, and they were just in the middle of the road that must pass through the rift valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black squid is vivid on the banner, twisting nine tentacles, and the eyes seem to burn with flames. The flag is in charge of Moore. He was very satisfied with this position, so his face was full of pride and perseverance. Siegel nodded to Mana, the female knight bent the archery, and a feather arrow without arrows crossed the open space and shot on the soft land. The tail feathers tremble slightly in the morning breeze. Segal rode off the queue and went alone to the front of the queue, stopping behind the feather arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Siegel. The squid, the lord of Heim and the baron of the city of Mith, who will talk to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Dray rode past and stopped in front of Siegel. He looked up and down the long-known young city owner, just as Siegel was looking at him. Black hair and black eyes, a young face without wrinkles, a confident face with a faint smile. Viscount Drey sighed the restless horses, wondering why the old horses who had been fighting for so long were so nervous? It was not until this time that he discovered it. It turned out that the other side was riding a mount consisting of stars and shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually rode the starry sky, he actually wore the sun. The Viscount Drey stunned, and the old wound on his right knee began to faintly hurt, and the other side was full of glory - he had the feeling of failure for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Young Viscount, I really didn't expect it. I didn't expect that I fell into your grasp like my own child. If you think you rely on more than 30 archers, you can stop my way. And you can humiliate me here, then you are very wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have that meaning." Siegel said: " I just hope that you can put down your arms and surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha. Daydreaming!" Priest Drey replied: "My infantry can take three minutes to rush. This dwarf, the cavalry only takes a minute. How many arrows can your archer shoot? I can withstand the sacrifice of one hundred people, you? And you are so close to me, there is only a red robe There is no armor, and my sword is at hand. Who do you think should surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Viscount, I am talking to you here, is Do the responsibility of a noble lord. I also know that I have another identity, a mage." Siegel clap your hands, and you hear the sound of the Rift Valley region of low hill at the junction of the issued Gala Gala, shake the dust is shaken off the ground, form a layer of low clouds. Then there was a lot of cracks in the whole land, which became soft and disintegrated, and large chunks fell into the invisible rift. The original ten-meter-wide passage now has less than three meters, and it continues to collapse, and no one dares to test stability even in the remaining passages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Excellency, you see, how many troops can you rush to now?" Siegel said. "The road you left is also cut off by me. Unless Leap over a ten-meter-wide rift, or your man will be trapped there. Put down your arms and surrender, Mr. Viscount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Drey’s hand Touching the hilt, he never gave up practicing swordsmanship because he never felt that he had finished the last glimpse of life. When Siegel saw it, he turned the cloak backwards, revealing two long swords at the waist. One handle is the dust of the stars, and the Viscount Dray does not know, but he is no stranger to the other. William likes the weapon very much and it is always inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands raised and lowered, and finally sighed and asked: "How is William?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has been captured by me." Siegel said: "He fought heroically, but he eventually failed, along with his cavalry. He will be imprisoned because he In the process of marching, the innocent businessman was killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I redeem him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Siegel shook his head and replied: "If there is peace between you and me, you must build on William as a proton to stay on the foundation of the city of Mith. He can read, practice, and live in the castle, but can't leave. There, when he completes the crime of repaying the innocent businessman, and after ten years in the city of Mith, he will be free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will be there Near forty years old!" Count Drey roared. But he knew that Siegel did not do much. Asking for protons was a very good means of guaranteeing peace. He said that this proton was still captured by him. Finally, the viscount said, "What about those of us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides a long sword, leave all the weapons and armor, then I will allow You return with your mount; if you want to keep your armor, leave the corresponding mount.” Siegel replied: “This is a reparation for war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I didn't expect you a little baron..." Viscount Dray shook his head. "It doesn't make sense to say anything at this time. It can only seem to have no weight. Just like victory won't last forever, failure will be the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I know." Siegel replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Drey came down from the saddle and Siegel stood in front of him. As a ritual of surrender, the Viscount untied his sword, and Siegel took it and returned William's sword to him. Seeing this scene, the soldiers led by Hilo knew that they had failed, and the war had already broken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it should be time for them to drop their armor and then leave the battlefield, but at this time there is an abnormality. The ground in the Rift Valley began to vibrate again, which is no longer a ghost of Siegel's earth elements, but a real earthquake. Everyone sat down on the ground and watched the last three meters of the passage break. The black abyss trapped the Uther family soldiers in the center. The horses were frightened and the knights struggled to pull the reins to prevent them from running around. Many militiamen fell to the ground and prayed loudly to the Mother of the Earth, begging her to be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
