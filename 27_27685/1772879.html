			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sat by the brazier, covered in a thick blanket, holding a warm glass in his hands. Please search (product #书...网)! The power of the fastest-updated novel Ice Gun is deep into the soul, and it takes a long time to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand still can’t stop shaking, on the one hand, the injury caused by the weapon collision in the battle, on the other hand, the plasma is converted into an element and forced to use Caused by a spell. Now even the action of holding the glass is not good, and the liquid surface is constantly rippled. Fortunately, there is no need to cast a spell now, otherwise the failure rate will be high and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knox actually unknowingly mixed in and cast a spell on me." Kerry still felt like a nightmare, Said to Siegel: "If it weren't for you, I would bring the entire grassland tribe to the bald knives and send them to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Jackdaw tribe has no experience in dealing with the Master. It is not surprising that this happens." Siegel said: "The knife that was caught, how was your interrogation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, his mouth was very hard, but in the hands of people who peeled the tribe, even the gods could not hold on. On the grassland, there was a place in the tribe that I didn't like the most. But now these people do have some skills." Kerry had a penetrating injury to his left palm. He moved his finger a little and then said: "He has already opened the dynasty and said a lot. But the skinned person did not stop the torture, still Repeat it over and over again. Knox's sorcerer is good at playing with ideas, not sure Words are deceptive. But the skinners are more powerful in playing with flesh and blood, let them go to work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, thankfully this is called "Frank "The knife's face was caught back." When the jackdaw's cavalry found him, the man was almost close to the edge of the Holy Land. The cavalry dragged him back, took off his wig, and found an old whirlpool tattoo on his bare head. The Knox Association officially became the enemy of the Jackdaw tribe, and the entire grassland was on alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I almost ruined a good situation." Kerry buried his fingers in his hair, and the giants were helpless. "I became stunned after becoming the King of the Khan on the grassland. Even if I didn't control the magic, I was too proud. Even the persuasion of my friends didn't listen. I became obedient. Siegel, how can we avoid this situation, how? Can you always do the right thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You ask me?” Siegel pointed to himself and then waved his hand: “There are only two of us here, I I will tell you the truth. I don’t know the answer to your question. No one knows the answer. You have to know that even God is the time to make mistakes. I dare not say that my choice is right. The conclusions that came out could not always be converted into victories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry looked up and asked Siegel: "Then you decided to play with me. Is it calculated that he can win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?" Siegel said. "My only thought at the time was to provoke you, let your blood flow come out, squeeze away the curse of thinking, and then stick to it as long as possible before you beat me. Unless I use magic, if I use martial arts alone, I It must be dead. You are not normal at that time. If you calm down, I will have died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry nodded and thought about the process of comparison. Then he said unceremoniously: "You also know that you can't beat me, don't say anything else, you are indeed an honest person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿!" Siegel knocked on the ground with a wine glass and said with great dissatisfaction: "I want to save you, don't you hurt so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know if I am leaving The Holy Land, you can let me down in a few minutes." Kerry said: "But here, you take too much risk. Do you think you really will not die?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard the goodwill of Kerry. Then he said: "The situation at the time couldn't think too much, only desperately and risky. As I said, no one can always be right, but if you are afraid of danger and your brother is killed, it must be wrong."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you always have reason," Kerry said. "Through this lesson. I have already invited the priests of the Three Spirits Hall to find ways to discover and prevent thoughts. Before we found a way, the Holy Land is our only barrier. Under my command, the Prairie tribe began to assemble here. Just like a flock in a blizzard, what do you think of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the time you compare with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded, and Kerry fully understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had been talking in the long hall for a long time, setting a covenant for the Heim and the Jackdaw tribe. Through the "Semi-mountain Road", the transportation line of important materials such as horse weapons, grain and leather was established, and the forces were unified to resist the invasion of the elves. Siegel and Kerry are in the south, one in the north, echoing each other, cooperating with each other, looking for fighters. The war initiated by the elves is not necessarily an opportunity for these two brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves are very proud, Knox is also a joint, their strengths are comparable." Siegel pointed to a point on the hand-painted map, against gram He said: "If the common association is forced to a certain extent, it may take extreme measures. This place is the key place to kill them, and it is the most important purpose of my visit to you this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry wrinkled the place pointed out by the eyebrows, the grassland tribes have never been so far, and how can the cavalry go up the mountain? But according to the analysis of the Master, there is indeed a place to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New hatred and old hate together!" The giant slammed the table. "You can rest assured that it is desperate and will block Knox's backhand!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through the Mid-Levels Road, I will transfer some familiar soldiers to exchange your cavalry, which is good for us, and can be used for future actions. Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A word is fixed." Kerry said, "You and I will make the world shocked."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map before Siegel, he does not want Kerry to be so optimistic. Despite many efforts, there are still too many elements outside his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the dwarves of Mora’s sorrow suddenly come in? The starry kingdom on the other side of the sea should not sit and watch the New World completely fall into the hands of the elves. When will the Masters Association be released? How much power does the Federation ultimately have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called one-stop movement, the power of the New World itself is also intricate. There are still many problems to be solved in this half-mountain road, and as the volume of business is increasing, the problem will be more and more. The allocation of resources and benefits, the issue of security, the measures to avoid stimuli, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, unlike the tribes of the grasslands, the tribes have been unified in the name of the King of the Jackdaw tribe, and the southern lords are still in power, and several major forces are difficult to unite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Heim was on the edge and was not caught in the gap. Otherwise, worrying about all kinds of conspiracy traps all day will consume a lot of Siegel's energy, and what time is it to study magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with so many problems, Siegel can only show a relaxed smile, can only say encouragement, so that Kerry is full of fighting spirit. The conspiracy of this congregation made Kerry very uncomfortable, and the giants were not good at expressing, so many emotions were in my heart. Siegel wants to comfort him, but he doesn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He himself is equally distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two people came out of the long hall, there was snow outside, from the mountain to the foot of the mountain. Everyone can take a break and liberate themselves from the contest and the battle that followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slashed sorcerer was tortured in a camp at the foot of the mountain, and his screams fainted. Fortunately, all the magic is suppressed here, so that this person is not allowed to leave, or Siegel will face a more dangerous situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two came out, Kerry’s new guard immediately “humbled” and followed closely. This guy named Cui Li is a powerful guy between shadow and flame. If he doesn't know his origins, Siegel almost suspects that he is the elite of an assassin organization. Kerry’s protection of such people should be much safer; and after this incident, the Jackdaw tribe changed the way the leader decided everything, and invited the chiefs of the tribes and the highly respected priests to form a core meeting to decide the details of the work. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important step on the road to civilization, and Kerry is the true cornerstone of the king of the grasslands. If Heim’s collar can’t develop rapidly, it will one day be swallowed up by this force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
