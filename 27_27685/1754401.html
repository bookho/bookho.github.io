			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a transfer channel is a delicate task to balance the forces of the elements and then join together to tear the stable structure of the original space, forming a crack, and then Then establish new stability. Destruction is easy, and controlled damage increases the difficulty, and then builds a stable channel at the same time—the difficulty of transmission is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of everything is to gain control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used a wand to circle the air in the air, a small space hole formed under his magical power. But inside this passage is a dark void, a world without dimensions. There is no substance, no energy, no concept of time. This is the mezzanine of the space, just the entrance to the transfer channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the existence of an exit, this entrance can only be maintained for a moment, and then it will collapse silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s painful forehead, the more he wants to gain control, the harder it is to communicate with elements and magical energy. Just like hitting a wall with a fist, the greater the force, the greater the power of the earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to calm himself down and walked to the window to look at the outside scene. From the study you can see the busy people in the castle, open the window to hear the monotonous clanging of the blacksmith shop and the cries of the animals in the horse shed. The maid who was watering the well was amused by the laughter of the stable of the stable, and was laughing. The Moor who was practicing the sword was reprimanded by the Elf, and he was doing push-ups in the mud. The dwarf’s shoulder was as big as his body. The oak barrel, which contains his favorite liqueur, is swaying through the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Janet coming out of the kitchen and heading towards the castle. He saw a lunch box in her hand and walked very slowly. The dragon girl, Capricorn, also followed her, and sipped her mouth while carefully looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the ability to see the vision, you can see the energy of the surrounding elements form a vortex, which is constantly being absorbed by the Capricorn. Janet was calm and calm, as if he was in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm eye? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s glory is now suddenly realized. He has been trying to build a static balance for stable delivery. Build a solid bridge. But there is another balance in the world, that is dynamic and free, and can exist in the violent and serene cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and the spell of the transfer came out. The wand in the hand stirs the power of the elements, connects them end to end, and then rotates like a vortex. He threw the magic structure formed by the spell into this vortex, no longer insisting on control, but letting them form a relatively stable structure in collision with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door that makes up the entrance is open. Then stabilized, and did not collapse in an instant, this is a major improvement. Siegel feels that he can continue to think about adding spells to this structure. Maybe it can form an exit! His heart is ecstatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic power washes his body more violently than ever before. But under his control, there is no pain, but it brings ecstasy and **. He opened his eyes, tried to stare at the void, and projected his thoughts into it, thinking of creating a passage from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright light appeared in the darkness, like a fish. It leaves a fleeting trajectory in the void. It's hard to be locked in mind. Siegel stays focused and knows that it is the key to opening the delivery exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light spot is constantly making a sudden turn, forming a sharp sharp corner. Siegel thinks this pattern is familiar and seems to have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne behind the bronze gate at the top of the red-red minaret! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel remembers, this pattern is similar to the trace on the throne, completely the same style. Are all the tracks on the throne recorded in the void? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment of distraction, he immediately regained his focus. Perhaps it is unintentionally consistent with certain rules. Perhaps his control has met the requirements, the light spot has stabilized, and it has expanded rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light curtain is formed. Siegel can see the opposite scene through the void. It was a dark hall, a steel throne in the center, stared at the heads of countless monsters around. Unlike the last time I saw it, the dark lines on the throne are emitting a green glow. Spread to the ground of the entire hall, forming a myriad of light trails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he was wondering, the green light trail climbed out of the portal and spread to the study in the city of Myers. The energy of the surrounding elements immediately became frantic and was absorbed madly, forming a huge wind pressure. Siegel couldn’t stop being sucked in, like a leaf falling into the vortex of a river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pulled out the dust of the stars and forced it to the ground to stabilize his body, but it was useless! He was struggling and felt the pressure on his body was getting bigger and bigger. The things in the room were constantly sucked in, and the book was smashing on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle's rune array felt abnormal, the protective spell worked, and the alarm sounded. The green track climbed like a vine and finally touched Siegel's sole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A current came from the soles of the feet, and Siegel’s entire leg was paralyzed, and he was even more difficult to stand still. A strong wind struck, he was directly sucked up, his feet off the ground, leaving only the sword to hold the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s angry waving wand mobilizes the energy of the surrounding elements, constantly bombarding the frame that constructs the portal, trying to break the balance of the spell. But all of this energy is absorbed by the green plasma and turned into the purest electrical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way to terminate the delivery, which is that the caster reaches the destination and completes the spell. Seeing that the walls and floors of the study began to collapse, and the gravel was sucked in. Siegel clenched his fist and took a deep breath, making a decision in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and tucked his message into the brain of Raven Barron. He had heard the footsteps outside the door, and Capricorn was coming quickly. If she is sucked in, then the entire castle has no final defensive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t make the situation more troublesome, Siegel pulled out the dust of the stars, let the power control itself, and then was sucked into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green plasma strives to keep the door open, but is unable to change the rules of magic. The entrance to the formation of elemental energy is turned off, and the source of its power is cut off at once. It can only continue to corrode the ground, and then vanish in the face of the ice power of the squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet stroking the slightly raised belly and coming over, watching the messy room with the dragon girl. "Siegel? Where did he go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a trace of magic transmission, beyond the general intensity." Smell, frowning and said: "The electrical energy here is very strange, which interferes with the transmission, so I don't know where he went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldn't it be the hands and feet of the Knox Synagogue?" Janet asked very nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't seen Knox their spells, so I don't know." Capricorn waved his hand and stabilized the surrounding elements. "But I think this transfer is performed by Siegel - it's all his smell - so the transfer itself should be safe and won't hurt the caster. The only thing to worry about is what's on the opposite side of the transfer, Will it be a dangerous environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenette snorted, his voice trembled and eagerly asked: "How can I know? God praying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn's eyes turned and suddenly thought of an idea: "Where is the black bird of Siegel? Master's magic pet If there is nothing, then the Master will not have anything in itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Janet held the door frame and shouted: "Who saw the Raven Baron! Go and find me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the servants looked around, the blackbird flew over. It stopped in Janet's palm, smashed it with a small head, and smashed it into a group. Then it coughed hard and coughed like a human, and said in a childlike voice: "I... I will come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is this what Siegel told you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven nodded cleverly, looked around with black eyes, and then stared straight at the A bottle of ink on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet understands what it means, and quickly prepared parchment and quill for the raven. Baron licked his head and tried to write a few words. Everyone couldn't understand what the staggering characters were. The raven blinked and threw the quill aside and licked the ink directly with his own pointed mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
