			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner ended the lunch break and rushed to greet the guests, adding a room by the way. The group went to wash first, washed away the exhaustion of the trip, and sat comfortably on the first floor dining area to enjoy the cold mug of fruit wine. With the guidance of Jeff, a local, they had a good dinner with very little expense. There are hot soups, fruit salads and apple pies on the table, and the roast broth and roast rabbits are coming up, and there are a few hot fresh breads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since living here is very good, and there is still a long time from their departure to Longshi Cliff, the pedestrian decided to stay for a few days. Sir Bill and Leah plan to turn around in the surrounding villages and towns, maybe you can find the trolls. Jeff got the jazz's asylum, but he still has some debt-related things to close. Siegel is still meticulous in practicing martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the high level of understanding, Siegel still does not have a bit of relaxation, he does not want to be reprimanded by Sir Bill. The jazz is a picky person. He has a very keen eye and the ability to find problems. Small negligence and mistakes can also be discovered by him. So Siegel sang the elf poetry and practiced knife dance over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day until the evening, the jazz and the elves still did not return, and Jeff went out with some old goods. Siegel finished his dinner alone and took care of his pony in the stables. Gently comb it and then prepare to take it and go around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a variety of people on both sides of the road. They have finished their busy day and are enjoying their leisure time here. There are humans who are whispering, a few dwarfs who are talking loudly, and gnomes who are swallowing clouds. There are still a few fuzzy figures sitting quietly in the corner of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is a strong young man, and he has a machete on his body, a look that is not easy to provoke. Although the pony in his hand looks healthy and beautiful, it is a Trekner horse that can be trained into a war horse, but those who are not good will also take risks and will not easily shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the horse out of the town and came to the open space next to the river valley. There is a river embankment built in the Earl of Stadt, and there is a smooth ramp next to it. Siegel turned over and let the pony walk slowly. You can't ride hard now, but you can gradually exercise the negative gravity of this mount. The horse is still small, and there is no way to equip the saddle now, so Lia teaches him the elf war dance, and also lets him learn the elf's bareback riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool summer wind blows in the evening, the air is mixed with the fragrance of the earth and the aroma of firewood, which makes Siegel feel very calm. He likes this feeling, closes his eyes and lets the horse take it with him. They are on the way to the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the horse screamed in horror and jumped up. Siegel clasped his horse's neck and quickly opened his eyes. He saw a high-speed carriage driving away from the side, and the driver was still pumping a whip in the air. The little pony was so shocked that he left the road and ran wildly in the fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, I am with you, nothing!" Siegel tried to calm the horse's emotions and direct it to avoid those easy Falling, a dangerous place that can cause a broken leg. As he turned around the corner of a house, Siegel suddenly saw the figure in the corner, as if it were a child. He struggled to turn the horse's head and avoided the figure, but he was also taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a big black circle rushing toward himself, and then realized that it was a well. Siegel used his elf to train him during this time, bending over in the air and trying to balance. With a mess, Siegel fell to the bottom of the well. Fortunately, he was on the head and feet, did not get water, and did not suffer any injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wellhead is about 10 meters deep from the bottom. At this time, a figure emerges from above and shouts. The sound rang in the well and barely made it clear: "Are you okay? Is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wipes the water on his face Responding to him: "Nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above answer: "Do you want me to bring you up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't have a rope! Wait for me to think of a way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Siegel looked at it, this well is not wide, he can open both hands to touch the walls on both sides, maybe you can try to climb yourself. Although the well wall is wet and slippery, it is still not flat, and there are some bumps that can be caught by fingers. Siegel moved up cautiously, and his muscles fixed his body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm fine! There is a hidden door!" Siegel replied: "I will pass in a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret door! Wait for me to find the rope "The figure disappeared from the well, it is estimated to go looking for something." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel climbed up again, he walked around the narrow door of the secret door, and only wanted to go up. With the light from the wellhead, he barely observed the dark door. Behind the open gap is a slanted channel, with steep steps pointing downwards and not knowing where to go. Siegel’s vision was barely visible, and at the end of the steps there was a stone gate with a bow and arrow symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel climbed out of the wellhead and saw that his horse was standing quietly, and looked at its owner with embarrassment. Next to the horse, a ragged, slim teenager is trying to tie the rope for the fence. This kid looks like a fifteen or six-year-old. He usually doesn't have enough to eat, and the slightly wide robes are covered in slender body. He had a rag headband on his head, and his face was muddy and gray. No wonder I just saw a black shadow and couldn't see the look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow! You can climb up yourself, it’s amazing." The boy said, revealing a white, sparkling tooth. "Come on, help me to pick up the rope, I want to go down and find the baby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees him as a tramp, with doubts: "You Wouldn't it be a thief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really unreasonable!" The boy said with anger: "My father said before his death, the house at home I hide the baby below, and I can take out the flowers after he dies. I am looking for the entrance, I was almost killed by you, and I am a thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry almost hit you. My horse was frightened and ran wildly. I managed to control it." Siegel was embarrassed to scratch his head: "You just don't want a thief. But you have thin arms and thin legs." "Where can you climb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! I’m going to be angry! You’re falling into me, actually saying cool!” The man picked up the ground The small stones, smashed over: "Come on! Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could this stone hit the middle Siegel, he easily avoided . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little pony saw the master beaten, and some were unhappy, arching the boy from behind. The boy shouted: "Even horses bully me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel was even more embarrassed, whistled and called the pony to himself, then Said: "I will help you, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young boy stunned and said: "You must want to steal the treasures of our family! "People are dressed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has no worries, naturally he will not be angry and angry. He explained: "It is dangerous to go down the well. You may be so thin and may have an accident. You also need someone to help you bring things up. I won't take things in your home. I can only offset the ill-up of bullying after I help you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy thought about it and saw the sincerity that Siegel said, so he smiled: "Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put the horse Kneeling in the corner, the fence was taken apart and the rope was taken down. The boy took an oil lamp from the house, a hatchet and a large pocket. They fixed the rope and climbed down in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small oil lamp emits a faint glow, and two people can only see a short distance between their feet and their front. This sloping channel is wet and slippery, covered with moss and small mushrooms. Segal held the boy in his hand and walked forward with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what is your name, I can't always feed you, please." The young man said: "I am malt, but you can manage I am called a little finger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Siegel-Squid. Do you know what a squid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, is it a very powerful creature." The little thumb blinked and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... to some extent yes. I heard the sailors say that the squid in the deep sea can be as big as a small hill. But the average squid also It’s as long as the arm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
