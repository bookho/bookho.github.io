			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of dragon's blood stunned the surrounding fish, and several manta rays that were smashed together smashed, but it caught the attention of Siegel. . Www/xshuotxt/com Manta ray is a flat, blanket-like creature that uses wide wings to "fly" in the sea. It likes to look for shellfish and fish and shrimp under the bottom of the body, and only use the spikes on the tail to injure people when they are irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of biological temperament is moderate, and I like to play with the seafarers who dive. Siegel often took advantage of their wide wings and let them cruise in the sea. But manta rays don't like to squat together when eating, so the place where they gather is likely to be weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people wandered from the bottom of the water and finally found what they were looking for. At the bottom of the water, there is a round man-made metal top cover with a diameter of two meters, and there are traces of the newly opened, which must be the place to abandon the colloidal corpse. There are other rubbish nearby, such as many broken pieces of meat or food debris, which is why attracting small fish and gathering manta rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel puts his hand on the metal lid and lets the power of the element perceive. There is no magical fluctuation here, but there is a force field spell that blocks the flow of water under the lid. I am afraid that because there are often fish passes here, in order to avoid being harassed by alarms all day, there are only protective spells and no early warning spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be an early warning spell after entering the channel, but it can at least serve as a breakthrough. Siegel placed a rune stone next to the metal lid and buried it in sand, covered with an anemone. This runestone has no other effect than the ability to evoke weak magical fluctuations that are perceived and located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cocked his thumbs up and signaled the gnome to prepare for the water. When finally got out of the water and breathed fresh air, the gnome overcame the tension. Be able to think normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back." Siegel grabbed Yao En and performed flying. Two people circled the cliff and took a big circle at the sea. Only returned to the scope of the town. The mage was thinking about how to open the metal cover quietly and go to the passage to see. The result did not pay attention to the situation of the gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came ashore, Yao En was pale, his lips trembled, his hands and feet became stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, actually forgot this thing!" Siegel rushed to cast a spell, warmed him with fire elements, and gave Yao En The treatment potion is under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still winter, although the waters of the South are not frozen. But it is still cold. Siegel's armor has the function of adapting to the environment and warm in winter and cool in summer, and he also carries a living ring, which does not feel wrong. The gnome Yao En did not have such good equipment. He was afraid of the sea. He stayed at the bottom of the water for a long time. After he came out of the water, he was blown by the cold wind at the speed of flight. He fell ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel held Yao En and climbed up from the small dock. The ship-loading worker looked at him with a dull look until Sigel screamed and returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no spirits, warmth! My friend fell into the water!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Only the rum is usually on the sea. A thirst-quenching drink that is not spicy and does not spoil for a long time. However, sailors usually bring some private goods in the compartment of the cabin, and one or two bottles of good spirits can still be found. Although it is necessary to pay the high price of three gold coins, it can save lives for the gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yao En is constantly coughing by the wine cellar. But I have some rosy colors on my face. "I will take you to Arnold, you must be fine, rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel holding the gnome, quickly stepping towards the "South China Sea Guard" The castle "walked, and on the way he saw the Arnold Gate, who was preaching the motherhood of the earth." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor holds the holy emblem and recites the hymn to the mother of the earth with a magnetic voice, hoping to attract the audience with the ideas of kindness, guardianship and mutual help. But beside him, besides being on the ground, painting on the sand with branches, it is beyond the boring Evan. Only one woman with a nursing child listened to him. After a while, it is estimated that the sun is enough. The mother and son staggered and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after drinking a few mouthfuls of spirits, the situation of the gnomes has begun to improve, but it takes time to restore control of the body. Arnold put the sacred emblem of the Mother Earth on the top of Yao En's head, and he confessed to his words and prayed for him. The warm, soft light emanates from the sacred emblem, covering the whole body of the gnome. The trembling fingers gradually calmed down, and Yao En closed his eyes and went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, rest will heal, and there will be no fever." The priest picked up Yao En and stood up: "Let's go back first." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in a thick blanket, leaning against the burning fireplace, his hands still holding a steaming potion, Yaon woke up after a nap It became this appearance. No fever, no headaches, no other low-temperature symptoms, he just keeps sneezing, how can the nose flow stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the body's gradual recovery, and the prayer to drive away the disease will not let him get rid of this state immediately." Anomen said after checking again: " Don't worry, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, I can't keep quiet." Yao En sneezes while sucking his nose. It seems awkward. "I hit a sneeze and everyone in the entire passage heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What channel? Why are you getting into the water?" Naria sings at Siegel Something angry: "You are doing nothing, making Yao En so miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really sorry, this is not my intention." Siegel said sincerely: "At the time, I found a clue. Some were too excited and ignored these details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing does not blame him, I Some overestimate their physical fitness.” Yao En sucked his nose and said: “There is a strange underneath Shaq Manor. At least we found a large underground project. The passage on the bottom of the sea is only a few hundred meters long. Specially used to discard rubbish and colloidal monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glue?" Evan’s spirit: "That's the kind we met in the hotel." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. We have at least found more than twenty colloidal monsters that have turned into rocks." Body, so there should be more in their base.” Siegel introduced the situation around the submarine passage and the defense of Shaq Manor and the cliff, and then asked Evan: “What did you see in the town?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be bored, we have been bored all the time." Evan shook his head: "I don't want to come back for the second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anomen did not feel this way, he still smiled: "Although not many people stay away from the long-distance listening, but the people here do not bother us, not the god of murder. Believers are in trouble, so everything is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately? You are too optimistic." Evan waved his hand: "You are too invested in the estimate. I noticed that the townspeople here simply used the two of us as clowns for the show. I didn’t miss the ridicule and proud expression revealed in their eyes, as if they were higher in our faith. Just like they claimed to be For the Duke, the Marquis, plus a mess of titles, one It feels so unbearable that I feel so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, our task is not to teach them the correct concept of life." Ms. said: "You have no trouble in the hotel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take your blessing, Jag sleeps a lot, and wakes up is really Nothing to remember. "Naria's tone is still cold and cold, and she said to everyone: "After you left, there were a few waves of people coming here, and it was called to hang a new name card. In fact, the eyes came to us from time to time, it is estimated to be a spy. To touch the situation. And there is one more thing I think is very strange. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child we saved on the road appeared again. He brought a basket of cheese to Jagger for delivery. After seeing both of us, I left. Come over and thank us. "Naria frowned, her fingers rubbing on the table: "Do you still remember the look he was afraid of at the time?" Now he has become very enthusiastic and seems to have changed into a person. I asked a side-clicking attack. He said that his sister was jealous and should thank the savior. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Yao En looked at each other with a glance. This doubt cannot be ignored. "In addition to his gratitude, he said nothing else." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
