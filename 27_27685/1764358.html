			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this deputy, I feel that my hand is still there. Although there is no finger, but it hurts, it has been painful!" Hanging his head, his expression is deserted and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is also silent. It is a terrible thing for a mage to lose his hands, even worse than the swordsman losing his hands. In the past, swordsmen put long swords on the broken limbs and re-emerged as strong with amazing perseverance, but it is difficult for the Master to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic requires fine tuning, and it is necessary to combine the sound and posture to build the structure of the spell. The most flexible and easy to control person is the throat and fingers, so the spells are basically inseparable from these two parts. Only the caster has a personal experience: simply making a sound and waving the arm can't build a spell. Only through these actions, gradually grasp their influence on the spell spell, and remember the feeling of the release success, in order to truly master this spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands lost, it is difficult to perform a full cast, and the spells that the Masters learned before are premised on the hand. To regain the ability to cast spells, almost overthrow everything, abandon gestures, and rebuild the structure of the spell structure, whether it is difficult or the time required, can not be completed in decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, Siegel does not know what method to use to comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't imagine that terrible feeling. The pain is only one aspect, or the simplest. When you were learning spells, you didn't experience more. The pain." Master McGonagall's voice slowly spit out, lingering in the cell, blending with the sound of the chain. "I am often injured. Those who are with me often mess up my spellcasting materials, or scare me when I cast spells, causing spells to fail. Flames, ice, and sour, I have experienced them, almost every day. They all live in pain, but I know that I am progressing, I will surpass them, so the pain is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am often injured, but never like It’s such a humiliation now. It’s never been so desperate, it’s much more terrible than physical pain. Day and night, the broken limbs always have a burning sensation. It’s been a long time, but I always feel that everything is still in them. I burned the wound with a brazier. I completely cut off the connection between me and the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what Pulan said?" Give her a pair of iron hands The chain is long, it is best to do five. This is an immortal finger, you can always use it. He actually laughed at me like this, this damn bastard. Hangman!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel comforted her and said: "Some temples can be ruled The broken limb can make the hand grow again. I have a dwarf friend, and he has cured the leg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should the dwarf priest treat me? I don't believe in his god!" McGonagall snorted. "The priest of the temple is just the shadow of their god, the channel of divine power. The real decision is whether to treat me with the gods, and the gods are not as easy as the pastor. Buying. The cost of curing my broken limbs is much higher than the ability to restore magic. Tell me: God, which one is not greedy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just know one." Siegel said: "I have seen a pastor who doesn't even know which god he believes in, but does not affect his use of magic. Various races, beliefs and professions. Anyone can get treatment from him. But he still doesn't have a broken limb. I think one day he will be able to master it. There is no hope at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Just...I think...at that time? You are lying to me. Comfort me with falsehood, want to guide my thoughts, and gain my trust." McGonagall gave a laughter: "I won't be fooled, you can't think of getting my secret!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, because he found that McGonagall had become unstable because of the pain of a long time. Although her broken hand is very sympathetic, Siegel does not have much time to give her psychological counseling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meg Mage. I don't need you to believe me, because the facts are facts and will not change because of your subjective feelings. As for your secret, you want to It’s your business to stay in the old days. I just want the Moonlight Moya Roll.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, if I gave you what you want, you can Give me something? I want freedom, I want magic, I want revenge, I want them to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and stood at Master McGonagall In front of you, let the torch in your hand illuminate your face. Let her see herself. Then he said: "You want too much. These things you want to fight for yourself, or exchange with people, can do this. But the premise is that you will return the things that are not yours. Tell me "The Moonlight Moya Vol." Where?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is crazy, and Siegel thinks about it with regret. In this situation, how can you not go crazy in such a terrible environment? This is not like a permanent madness, but the pressure that accumulates to a certain extent causes the mind to go crazy. Need to find a way to vent it, but this requires the operation of Master McGonagall's ideas. Siegel thought about it, so if you do, look for the answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the torch aside, raised his wand and began to recite the spell. It is very dangerous to use charm-like spells for individuals with mental disorders. If you use a prying spell such as a thinking probe, the danger is even higher. Siegel carefully spread the power of the spell and slowly penetrated into her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part about the spell is best not to touch, because that is the most rigorous part of the Master's protection, and most of the information is remembered with ciphertext symbols, decryption needs Quite a lot of energy. Siegel concentrated on finding the memory of the item. Where was the Moonlight Moya Roll placed by her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past things have changed into pieces, and they are presented a little bit. Siegel saw McGonagall's lab and saw that she was experimenting with alchemy, with a magical amulet on the table, exactly the same as she had bought from the old lady. But the amulet in memory looks plain, but it actually emits powerful magical fluctuations, like a heart full of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning the line of sight, you can't go to see the creation of magic items, it will consume a lot of energy - Siegel warns himself, controls magic spells, carefully avoids One trap after another. As long as he has a little curiosity about Meg's magic, it can cause the spells in his hands to fail. He is like walking on a cliff, with only a swaying steel rope under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally saw the book, and McGonagall placed it carefully on the bookshelf, just below the lab. When she left, she closed the door with a spell, letting the earth cover the traces of the entrance, making it look like ordinary ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic spell that opened the secret door is already known, and Siegel began to recite the end of the spell. It is good to break away from McGonagall’s thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange person appeared in McGonagall's memory, tall and thin, with a pair of pointed ears on his face. Elf? Siegel stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf casts a spell on Siegel so that his body can't move. Even blinking and moving your tongue won't work. At this time, a man with a long sword came over, and Plane’s face was clear and terrible, and the shining sword was like a beggar. what happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel suddenly realized that this was McGonagall’s memory and he was not trapped. The memory of McGon's hands being cut off was too deep and spread all over her mind. It may come out at any time. Siegel warned himself to take back the curiosity, pull back his attention, and then retreat from the spell spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the elf that appeared in McGonagall’s memory? She had lost her hands after she had been in the spell, but why did she never say it? Why is the face of the elf blurred, and the face of Pran is so clear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the sweat from his head and slowly calmed the fatigue caused by the magical fluctuations. Also exhausted is Meg, her body trembles on the chain, and she has no strength to lift her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol carefully handed over the water bladder and let the Lord Lord take a rest. When he heard the sound of the water, McGonagall raised his head. The weak whispered: "Let me have a full drink before you leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finally awake?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meggie nodded, Siegel gave her water. Later, he took out a few elf biscuits and sent them to Meg's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage frowned and said unexpectedly: "Take away the elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You need to eat something, and this is the best food to restore strength." Siegel said: "It is also good for wound healing and fatigue recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I would rather starve than eat the food of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
