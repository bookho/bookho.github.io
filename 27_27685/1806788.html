			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, can you tell me what you think about Deepwater City?" Aunt Happ suddenly changed the subject, from The Wall of Storms and the Masters Association were transferred to the northern pearl of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or more accurately, the Northern Pearl of the New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Wizarding War, Deepwater City suffered heavy losses. The Guards and Mercenaries of the Masked Parliament were almost completely annihilated, and the Three Peaks Tower of the Masters' Federation was destroyed under the impact of the elemental surge. When the Elf army took the war with the old trees ready to take over the city, the Jackdaw tribe from the grasslands launched a second attack. Although the main target was the elf, after the defeat, the Jackdaw Tribe ransacked Deepwater City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heam’s Siegel also had a big share of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people say that this kind of behavior is arrogant and ruined, and Siegel never distinguishes. Regardless of how the Jackdaws and Heims act, the elves have already captured Deepwater, so the fate of the city will not change. The only difference is the identity of the occupiers and the actions they will take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves will not fight this in vain. According to their previous practice, all human inhabitants must take their food with them and leave their homes. Go back to the East. The rest of the city will be demolished like ants dismembering corpses and then become a world of trees and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox will control the orc army south to try to avoid this. If it wasn't for Siegel's prediction of this step, and early in the sniper attack with Kerry in the walled mountains, the orc could cause far more damage than the elf. Knox will only consider whether they can win or not, and how much care can the residents of Deepwater City care? If the orcs enter Deepwater City, the residents inside may even be extravagant when they leave the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribes on the prairie and the deep-water city have a complicated relationship. They have been fighting for more than 100 years. After four to five generations, they have not been able to say who is right or wrong. When Deepwater City was captured, the Jackdaw tribe finished the orcs, drove away the elves, and then gave the city to whom? The masked lords have lost their power, and the city garrison and the remaining mercenaries have lost control. It has become a robber who has searched from house to house. The giant Kerry led the men who paid the blood and sweat, unless he did not want to continue to be the king of the tribes, otherwise he must not return empty-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Siegel can do is to persuade Kerry to take away valuable things. Don't kill, you can only do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Sham Shui Po feel that Siegel is their pioneering knight, baron knight, and they should protect them and be a savior. Such hopes are understandable. The people in the Jackdaw tribe left. When Siegel arrived with the army, some people thought he would become the new lord of Deepwater City. However, the citizen council is still the citizen council, and the masked lords still use the new body to carry out the old rule, just as the Masters Association uses the school counsel to participate in politics. So Siegel surrendered the Baron of Deepwater and the pioneering knight, people regret, do not understand. Later, I heard that he shared the property of Deepwater City with the Jackdaw Tribe, and began to curse and marry him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is right, who is wrong? Deepwater City and Siegel are not right, but they are all good. If Siegel was a sergeant at that time, there would be a secret nuclear. With a magical spaceship, an electromagnetic gun and a spider magical force, he can stop the orcs and elves at the same time, avoid the deep water city being broken, and can compete with the Casper Master, and even protect the Masters Federation. But history is not there. Siegel was able to move around, and when the elf had not withdrawn from the embrace of Heim, he traveled across thousands of miles to support, and at the same time could not light his own army. In order to ensure that he can continue to confront the elves afterwards, how many options can he have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepwater City swears at him, does not welcome him, and rejects the residents of Heim. These Siegels can understand. There are actually a lot of things in the people's parliament that help the deep water city to form this "consensus." So for a long time, the residents of Deepwater City have neglected the fact that the lord who did not hold the city was the masked lord, and Siegel was the lord of Heim, not the deep-water city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of push has helped them to maintain their rule, after setting up a foreign enemy. They also logically began to prevent Heim's products from entering the Deepwater City market to protect their own workshops and income. After the rise of Shanghai's M-neck, they took the title of their first port in the New World, which made the reconstruction of Deepwater City very slow. The living standards of the wealthy businessmen have not been fully restored. The wealthy businessmen and the masked lords are not happy, the speaker is not happy, and the citizens' council will be unhappy. Therefore, after the Elven War, Heim and the Deepwater City have no contact, and Siegel also pays little attention to the movement of the Deepwater City. This kind of thing is generally Janet worried, she never said to Siegel: "You come to see, Sham Shui Po has changed," so Siegel did not know how to answer the questions of Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan took a glass of wine and sipped, listening to him and continued to say. According to Siegel, Deepwater City is a very smart city and prefers to calculate. There is no way to deal with the knight's thoughts, and bargaining is a normal state. The Master of the Federation said that the Three Peaks Tower has rich feelings and memories, but the impression of Deepwater City is a "market for buying and selling things." "My opinion is that they have no advantage, and they will never come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King’s Majesty nodded. “They want to give up independence. The autonomous identity returned to the rule of the starry kingdom." Evan touched his chin and said to Siegel: "They directly reported to my uncle, the Duke of Carlyle, the words of which were earnest and demanded the royal family. Sending a nobleman above the count to manage the Deepwater City, they are willing to become a Piaget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard the words, paused for a long time, then The opening said: "This is a good thing. Although it takes time to take over the city and turn it into a Piaget, there is no loss to the royal family. Deepwater City still has many specialties, and it is far from the city wall. The mountains are not far away, they also have trade with the grassland tribes, not a loss-making territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In principle, this matter is no problem, my and my royal family members have basically Agree, the problem is not now Evan took a look at the wiki. Evan looked at the wiki and said to Siegel: "While in Sham Shui Po, who can cooperate, who might be confused, there is a general investigation here, no matter which count is in the past, it will not It is a struggle alone. But the problem now is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of His Majesty is calm and cautious. He only said the first half of the sentence and kept silent. The intelligence manager waited for a few seconds and then knew that it should be interfaced by him. So he lowered his head slightly and then said to Siegel: "Deepwater City sent a letter of assistance at the same time. They thought that the Jackdaw tribe planned to attack Deepwater City again, and hoped that the kingdom could support it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel blinked and was shocked by the news. "Is there a spies on the side of the Jackdaws? Can you know the exact situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are indeed mobilizing troops, planning a battle, but who is the target? I don't know yet." The wiki smashed his hand and the apologetic smile flashed across his face. "My kitten is very difficult to do too much on the rider's site. The news is very strange and not too exact. So now many situations can only rely on speculation. I can only say that the situation is not good. Deepwater City is attacked. The possibility is great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can't play anywhere!" Avon's tone contained a hint of anger. "Heim can't beat them, and they don't want to fight; the terrain of Mora's top makes them invincible, and the riders don't have the slightest way; the trees in the Elven Forest will make the cavalry's ability to fall like a lame rabbit. It is not a choice. The rest of the hub is the site of my starry kingdom. If the prairie people attack the hub, it is also a challenge to the starry kingdom. Soon, the deep water city is the same, the territory of the kingdom!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may also be the orc in the north of the Walled Mountain Range." Siegel explained: "The Jackdaw tribe has a small territory north of the Walled Mountains, where they invaded the northern orcs. The territory, the establishment of the bridge and the collection of the tribe's bridgehead. Perhaps there is something wrong there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan frowned and thought, then sighed: "When you say that I think about it, there is such a thing. You are also a possibility to say this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Deepwater City faces this threat Why don't you come to me?" Siegel said: "They I have been for many years, and naturally I know that I have a lot of contacts with the Jackdaw tribe. I can influence the Horde in many things. Even if they don’t trust me, I will send troops again, but I should also think that I can mediate from it, maybe I can Avoid troubles. I saw with my own eyes that some of the wealthy merchants in Deepwater City can also go to the orc city of Macabu to do business, even if the orc pirates often rob their merchant ships. They don’t come to me, but around Such a big circle, I also offered the territory, I feel that something is wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also have the same feeling, these people in Sham Shui Po can not be underestimated. Evan said: "Remember the story of Aaron in Deepwater City? The masked lords may be laughing under the cover of the mask! If it is not the most important thing to take care of Aaron, then I really want a They hacked them all! Until the end of life, Aaron was the king's demeanor. Only in Deepwater City, it fell a bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know" West Geer shook his head: "Cheat Tired weak person, in exchange for inflated sense of self, masked gang lords to act means bad "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
