			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard's mages face each other and can hardly believe what they heard. They envisioned various situations and even prepared to prevent Siegel from destroying everyone with powerful elemental energy. Many mages have even changed their spell protection system to deal with dangerous events in their imagination, but no one expected it to be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They couldn’t help but have doubts, and what Siegel said was true. Does he have such ability, whether he has such determination, whether he is deceiving everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symonton stood up, haha ​​laughed twice and patted his belly and said, "Oh! Siegel, I decided to stay, and You change the world together. Do you know, I always want to see a thousand Masters and release the fireball at the same time, hahahaha, it must be spectacular!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said When I finished, I sat back and looked around. I tried to lift my legs and put on a smug expression. He underestimated the power of obesity, and the snoring of the seat under his butt gave him a warning. The plasticist put down his leg, snapped a finger and released a mage armor to the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little man's curse, Wiewood, smiles and says to Siegel: "Young people, your magical ability and drawings are very interesting, but I I want to see the real thing more. After all, the secret nuclear can be created by you, of course you can be like an arm. What do we do? It must be a bit practical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As you wish." Siegel opened the space bag and took out a straight wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My first wand was bought by the lamp god of the power fata, for the adventure of going north to the walled mountains. Everyone must remember that The sly salesman took 2,100 gold coins from me.” Siegel threw the wand in front of him to Wywood and said to him: “This is the apprentice wand I made. Please identify it. Function."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse picked up his wand with enthusiasm, used identification techniques, and frowned. He glanced around and used the appraisal again, but the brow wrinkled deeper. "This is not a magic item," he said. "There is nothing in the identification process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sharp-eyed mage next to him: "Are you mistaken, There is a magical light on this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whitwood glanced at the man: "I certainly know that he has magical light. Hey.<. I am again "It’s not a blind man." He pointed to the wand and asked Siegel: "Can you explain it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no doubt a wand, Mr. Weywood. You can use his spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse will be suspicious, but the words will release the spell. Although not as good as my wand. But this is indeed a qualified wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, it can also use unlimited light, reading magic and slaps every day." Siegel said: "These three spells can be said. It is the three most commonly used spells of apprentices. Especially reading magic spells is the foundation of all mage foundations, the root of the fundamentals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wywood I tried it a few times at once, as true as Siegel said. He is keenly aware of the key. Quickly asked: "What is the cost of this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the moment I have achieved ninety-two gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was a mess, and countless hands reached over to Verwood and asked for the wand. The dwarf curse snorted and raised a circle of flame shield around his body. Sure enough, except for a fat hand, the other hands shrank back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you make this wand in batches, I estimate that the cost can be reduced to about 50 gold coins." Siegel did not say his own line. If you count the current capabilities of the pipeline, it is okay to cut it in half. "This wand has its limitations and can only be effective within the scope of the secret nuclear. But everyone also understands that after the wand, the cost of practicing the spell by the mage is greatly reduced, and the benefits for training the mage are self-evident. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time is limited. I only made this wand. With everyone's ingenuity, I believe that there will be countless new creations soon. There are many people who throw fireballs, but only those who can change the world by creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer Shelley touched the green jade necklace on the chest and asked with a sharp voice: "Siegel, what if there is no place where the secret can be nuclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is no different from now.╪╪┢╪.[[.c"o<><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use this secret core very well, Can you build one for me? Asked Shelley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sincerely worth 900,000 gold coins." Said Siegel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! "Sheilai snorted: "I can hold the nuclear control in your hands, I am not at ease. Whether the mage cultivated in this way is the federation or the one that Heim has received. It’s really hard to say. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the Master is more, I will have a good business and make a secret." Siegel said: "Don't be too expensive." I need enough funds to continue to improve the effectiveness of the nuclear, and gradually change the current state of the technology is more and more messy. I would like to see more Masters appear. I never thought about going bankrupt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the Necromancer Shelley turned and looked at the half-elf Idis. "Old things, what do you think?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis lifted the wrinkled eyelids and gave her a faint look, then said, "What do I think, this is not all young." Is the world of people? I am just thinking about the views of the Masters Association. I don't know what those people are hearing today. What kind of price will be used to win over Siegel. Mire can nuclear, hey, the association can nuclear? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheilai was suddenly stunned. Now Siegel is not lacking potential collaborators, and the Masters Association can provide more refugees than the Federation." Much. Even without a collaborator, he can't implement this plan himself? Siegel is not only a mage, he is also a lord, he holds nearly 20,000 square kilometers of land, hundreds of thousands of people. Even if one percent of the wizards are born, there will be thousands of mages. Everyone estimates the cost of the matter in the heart - although it is very high, it is not impossible to complete.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters Association has opened a price tag for a lot of people, and I don’t know what to give to Siegel. If you count the secret, you may be the vice president or honorary president of the Siegel Masters Association. And then give him unlimited resources to transfer the right without any problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheilai also has his own ambitions. Secret can now "only" supply four Element, but if one day can output negative energy... wrong, elemental army is more than dead army It's much easier to use, and the nuclear shouldn't be such a usage. Positive energy, let it output positive energy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the four elements is now in the hands, Can positive and negative energy be far behind? Maybe positive energy can't bring eternal life, but it can solve many problems. Shelley thought of it here, and she already agreed. She said to Siegel: "In order to prevent the Master Association from inserting one in it." Feet, I am willing to help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing, all the Masters have formed a consensus. But how to avoid good things become bad things but have to work hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no faculty at the federation, and the "Big Three" system is no longer enforceable. Although everyone believes that William is still alive, he is trapped at the top of Mora and temporarily hopes not to The Masters agreed to use a relatively close set of rules to unite and change the status quo of each other. Under the prophet Jala's proposal, everyone brainstormed and began to modify the original federation's charter.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Wisdom Creature has the right to pursue magic and has the right to be free from persecution by the caster. The Federation will make unremitting efforts to this end. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the Federation from becoming a law enforcement agency such as a trial center, the new system requires the establishment of the Security Council, and the seats of the seven major factions are fixed members, not less than The second meeting of eight is produced by voting and lottery. Only after this Security Council agrees can the Federation send a mage to perform the tasks of arrest, detention, trial and execution of other casters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to respect the authority of the faculty, the faculty of the Security Council has a veto power. But each time a veto with a veto cannot pass five, it should be drawn by lottery. To a right, there is a permanent veto in the voting on all matters involving the Peruvian nuclear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he sat quietly , watching other people’s heated discussions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
