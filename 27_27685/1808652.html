			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and waved his hand to summon the dust of the stars, and then slammed it out. Count Todd snorted: "You are a strange sword, why is it only the tip of the sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hear the answer, he was The sword runs through the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sons of the Earl were shocked and just stopped rushing and were stopped by Evan. "Wait a moment, look at the situation, don't be impulsive like a hairy boy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel clenches the hilt and turns in the Earl's chest A circle to increase the speed of death from wounds. As a result of the pressure from the heart, the blood rushed out of the count's chest, soaked in the linen robe, and continued to the ground along the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be determined that the count has already swallowed, and everyone will turn their attention to the clone. Siegel could feel the fluctuations of the elements, and then heard that the original slow heart of the clones began to violently beat. With the sigh of "hehe...", the young version of Count Todd slammed up from the "Crystal Coffin" and coughed while covering his eyes with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was confusing until he coughed up a lot of dark brown pus. "What are these things, stinky!" The count's disgusting sorrow, holding the edge of the crystal sputum spit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he hasn’t eaten since he was manufactured, and he has nothing to vomit. After emptying the stomach juice, he began to feel thirsty again. "Water, or liqueur, I need to moisten my throat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best to wait for a while to eat and drink, your body needs to adapt to normal rhythms, especially heart and lungs And the stomach." Siegel carefully looked at the state of the clone, and smashed the count's hand with his eyes open: "The eyes have never really been used, so you have to let them adapt to the light, and it is no good to keep covering. If you have light, you can have life. As long as your eyes have no painful tears, then you will try to look at them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage, you said it is light! I only feel that it hurts all over the body and itchy!" Count Todd struggled for a few minutes and eventually adapted. He saw the people around him with his younger eyes, then climbed up from the coffin and bowed down to the king. Then he said to his son: "Take me twenty trotters after I go home today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father!" Go up. Wrap the Count of Todd with a large cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone understands that this should be the secret code set by Count Todd to authenticate himself. Evan went forward and checked the dead body. Then he was amazed at the new body of the count. The priest of the Temple of War was unable to speak at this time, and he could only kneel on the ground and hold the holy emblem to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, great God of War, what have I seen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection It is not just the power of the gods, but mortals can also master.” Siegel opened two middle-aged knights. The count was taken to the chair, and he checked the count's breathing and heartbeat, and looked through the eyelids to see his dual purpose. "It seems that everything is normal. All the functions of this body are working. But I suggest that you don't go home first, just stay here at the Star Fort. On the one hand, it is convenient for me to observe, on the other hand, it is closer to the physician of His Majesty the King. Can handle emergencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Living here, Earl." Evan nodded. "I want to eat the stewed pig's trotters, and eat them together at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and said: "I'm afraid not, it's best to drink for a few days." Porridge. Eat soft bread and goat's milk. Give me the stewed pig's trotters first! Right, the countess is still there, she can enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This sentence made the count in the embarrassment, do not know how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, everyone’s feet swayed and then they felt flying. The cloning experiment was carried out on a magical spaceship, and the spacecraft actually left the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, master, I saw the missile weapon of the goblin, a total of three. Is flying towards the king city!" The sound of the star is echoing in the cabin, this When she did not care, she was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but I have to see what happened." Evan replied with a categorical answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel takes everyone to a higher position room where the outer armor can be moved to reveal the glass window. Everyone saw the magical spacecraft exposing the minions, and the electromagnetic guns were constantly roaring. Like a continuous thunder. A spiral of smoke is generated and dissipated on the trajectory of the projectile, and the shining light shines straight into the distant horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, three gray smoke tracks are visible, like the rising smoke. But the smoke will not go diagonally, and it will not bring the threat of death. The global view of the Xingsuo played an important role, and it was far from the attack of the Goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the power of your magical spaceship?" The scene in front of the scene shocked the king and the count, and even the priest of the God of War was stunned. Their naked eyes can't see the shells at all, but the flight trajectory left in the air can infer the power of the weapon. The intelligence chief wiki once reported to the king that the magic spacecraft had broken through Swan Castle, but the wiki did not see the electromagnetic gun with his own eyes. He thought it was relying on the magic of Siegel or the spacecraft equipped with some very precise siege. . Now, His Majesty the King saw the electromagnetic gun with his own eyes, and did not say the power, that is, the launch speed has surpassed his cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first warhead was detonated in the air, not a nuclear weapon, but a conventional explosive warhead, then a second one. The electromagnetic guns turned in unison, and the fire net suddenly increased the density twice, exploding the third volley. This is a nuclear warhead that exploded more than eighty miles from the kingdom. A group of bright rays that are comparable to the sun illuminate the sky, and the mushroom cloud that rises rises to cover the sky, and the shadow of death envelopes the people of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who looks directly at the white light only feels that his eyes are hurting, but the distance is far enough, and the eyes are not permanently hurt, at least not embarrassing. The heat carried by the light ignited some of the thatched houses in Wangdu, causing many fires. The Xingsuo began to cruise the city under the orders of Siegel, using the creation method to continuously drop rain and quickly extinguish the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is the nuclear warhead, the weapon of the goblin." Siegel said: "It is best to immediately block the explosion area, where there will be deadly dust, It will pollute food and drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you take me to see?" Evan gnashed at the mushroom cloud that rushed straight into the sky, and his left hand squeezed into a fist. "Explosive area... Will anyone survive in the explosion area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "Even if I am, I am doing all the protection." Underneath, I can't survive in that kind of environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the goblin should die." Evan’s voice seemed calm, but Siegel could Hearing his suppressed anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangcheng was very chaotic for a while, but as the city guards began to maintain order, the magic spacecraft helped to save the disaster, and the uneasiness gradually disappeared. His Majesty officially issued a letter to the world, declared war on the world of the goblin, and carried out the general mobilization of the kingdom of stars. He approved the request of the Masters Association and the City, and entrusted them to start provoking and attacking the Goblin. This time there will be no objections, especially when Siegel closes his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the wiki also took action and began investigating the origin of the goblin weapon under the command of the king. In the end, how does the goblin pass through the barrier of the crystal wall, and how can it launch the attack on the king city. He suspected that the Masters Association or the Elf had some conspiracy in it, but was not sure if they had such courage. Siegel also informed the Federation that it is necessary to hide and defend the crystal wall passages in the northern part of the city wall. If the goblins have come here, they will definitely find ways to find more channels. The defensive ability of the federation is not as stable as the other channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomes are included as the primary enemy of the kingdom of the stars, all the lords of the whole territory must clear the goblins in the territory, without any excuses and delays, regardless of the cost, without loss. The goblin scalp can be exchanged for silver coins in many merchants, and then these merchants can turn the scalp in the Temple of War to become a gold coin or a magical potion. The treasury has saved some money, and the rest is the "contribution" of the various members of the royal family. This vigorous action is the idea of ​​Earl Todd. At least the various territories in the country are active, and the adventurers and mercenaries are busy, and will not be used by the people to avoid causing greater confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other temples also lend a helping hand to help treat people injured in the explosion. Siegel, on behalf of the Federation, and the school city have come up with treatments for nuclear weapons damage and dust pollution, and improved the curse effect of the priests of the temples. However, Siegel knows that the real damage will gradually emerge later, the distorted body tissue, the decaying organs and the dead fetus. The more the village is near the explosion, the more it will be affected. Siegel suggested that His Majesty the Kings gathered the residents of these villages, moved and concentrated, but they were opposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
