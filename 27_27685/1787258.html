			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigger’s forged passports are in the eyes of tax officials and there is really no difference, plus they are very familiar with the ten commanders, so they are released, Have access to Xi Ling City. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This castle built on a small island in the river does not occupy a large area, but it is very clever in the use of space, actually can separate one Knight's playing field. After inquiring about the ten captains, the Uther family liked the cavalry very much, so they tried their best to create this training ground. Although they can only be trained in batches, they have laid a solid foundation for their cavalry in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a game in the field now, and you can hear the sounds of horns, gongs and drums and fueling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't look very busy, but there aren't many viewers besides the Cavaliers." The ten commander said: "With the training venue, there is not much space to make." The stands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the lords' seats are placed on the tower next to the training ground, a prominent balcony, not on the training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group did not have much interest in the game and had to leave directly. However, the ten commanders warmly invited, and everyone must have lunch and say. Yao En looked at Siegel and nodded secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That disturbs you," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the training ground, all other houses are cramped and narrow. The ten-family’s home is in the same group as the other city guards’ dormitories, but because he is an officer, he has a separate bedroom and dining room. There is only one square table and eight chairs in the restaurant. Fortunately, there is no big man like Kerry or Dio in the group, otherwise it is impossible to sit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light in the oil lamp sways and flickers, and the sound of the mouse biting behind the wall. Yao En took out a pinch of powder and sprinkled it along the corner. Then everyone heard the mouse scream and ran away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smells the taste of belladonna, manndra and some insect venom, such dose does not harm the human body, but can scare away Small creatures such as mice, cockroaches, and flies make the room more sanitary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anomen, go cover our horses and make them quiet." Yao En then said to Naria and Emmon: "Just cover your face as soon as you leave the house. The province is in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do?" Evan leans on the pillars supporting the house. I took a long sword at the waist: "Can we not even protect two beautiful women?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course we will not get into trouble, but in the world There is always some rubbish.” Yao En sighed: “Garbage always wants to tarnish good things, such as our strong mounts or beautiful companions. When you hold delicious food, don’t want to go beside the pit, even if you know I can protect my food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan made a vomiting action, then said: "You are too analogy, next time you change your mind. But I understand what you mean, no one is so stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel  hair. Standing by the window and looking at the castle outside. This is a narrow castle, and the collective dormitory area is the narrowest part of it, which makes him feel uncomfortable, just like being trapped in a small compartment on the lower deck, it is a feeling of suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a team of patrolling soldiers picking up the hand of the girl passing by, the child with tears running away in his eyes was at most fourteen. He listened to the laughter from the soldiers and then saw a few high-ranking knights not far away. From their point of view, they must be able to see the evils made by the soldiers just now, but they did not stand up and stop. Siegel held his ears with his fingers and heard the tactics that the knights were negotiating the game. Exchange intelligence on opponents' weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel frowned, and he felt an anger in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun shines on the body, as well as the cheers and cheers from the arena, and does not bring to Siegel a full of vitality and joy. Instead, he could not stop being disgusted. Is the town that looks down from the tower of the castle different from the street that looks out of the narrow window? Isn’t Heim’s collar so narrow, crowded, and filthy? Looking at Yao En and Ano Men have long been eccentric, Siegel is more worried, more and more annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold put a gray canvas on the saddle with the emblem of the Mother Earth. Stealing the priest's horse is something that even a thief can't do, because no one knows when he will need the help of a pastor. The three knights looked around for a while. Shake his head and walk away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stewed fish came up in a short while, and the staple food was the “running dry food” that the adventurers kept. At the suggestion of Arnold, everyone prayed together, thanked the mother of the earth for the gift, and then bowed to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish soup is not as good as the ten commander said, and the smell of it makes Siegel nausea. It can even be said that it is difficult to swallow. Even though Siegel has been a sailor for many years at sea, even raw fish and raw shellfish can go straight to the stomach and have never eaten such food. Obviously, it’s not just that he alone thinks that except for Arnold, everyone just tastes it, and no one has ever smashed a second spoon into the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the ten captain and his wife ate with relish, and the eyes flashed with happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the taste, the meal was very rushed, and everyone didn’t want to take a lunch break here. They bid farewell to the ten captains, from the inner wall to the south exit of the castle. There is a small market here, all of which are prepared for the contest. Except for the two stalls that make broth, most of them are merchants who sell and repair weapons armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Meng wants to add his own stone, so it needs to be delayed for a while. Their nine horses caught the attention of several knights, but in the case of no one knows who is fine, there will be no idiots to grab in addition to the faulty or drunk fools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The things here are really expensive! Twenty stone bullets actually cost me two gold coins!" Ai Meng was very uncomfortable and said with anger: " Half a gold coin is actually a tax? This is too far off the mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A quarter of the tax?" Yao En then asked: "The knights are Is it the same to buy things here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Ai Meng took the horse and walked next to the gnome: "When I stay, I will come. The more you worry about the purse, let's go quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be that simple, Siegel thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone bridge leaving the castle also has obstacles, and there will be a grand celebration after the Cavaliers competition, so every "guest" will stay at the party. Money, five gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emmont squeezed the stick and sighed. Naria calmed her in the side, lest she be impulsive because of her anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine yourself as a hard, cold stone, these stinky eggs can't affect you." Narya gently caressed Ai Meng's back and put her Take it in your arms. "It's okay, let Yao En and Jie go to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the ghost idea of ​​who is going to collect the money from the party to the party." ? Five gold coins are not five copper plates, no one can spend five gold coins on a meal, which is obviously robbery." Yao En said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knights have strong strength and their appetites are correspondingly larger. This is understandable." The city gate official said: "I only pay for the release, the other is not. It’s necessary to talk too much with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood in front and asked, “Do you need to pay the money for the knights and jazz?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, the merchants who stayed are not used. Only you are passing in a hurry, enjoying the protection of the castle, enjoying the scenery of the contest, but a big man. If you don’t want to be jealous, you should pay this toll.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It seems that Uther’s finances are really stretched.” He snorted and said to the gnome: "What high opinion do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High see? Don't laugh at me, how can we still?" Yao En quite helpless Said to him: "Jes, you are all taller than me, and the castle is higher than everyone. The reflection of the siege is still dangling in my eyes, we only have six People, there are two ladies, what can you do? From here, the railings are blown up and rushed out, and you may not be able to reach the other side of the river and you will be shot. Hey, the lord is the biggest, and the power of the lord on the territory is inviolable. What should I do? Money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
