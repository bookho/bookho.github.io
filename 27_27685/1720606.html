			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of Siegel’s lord officially began, although many times he did not feel special, still the same as before. He does not feel that he and other people are essentially different. Everyone is a happy creature in the sky. The only difference is the responsibility and problems faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs don’t know what they should do, they don’t cultivate, they only hunt and pick the fruit. As a result, most people choose to become miners, the rest or become farmers, learn the secrets of farming in three villages, or become handymen in the blacksmith shop, relying on strength to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original villagers began to understand gradually what kind of person their lord was after a period of wait and see. They have been worried that the new lord will collect taxes after arrival. After all, this is his power, and many lords have established prestige through such behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the spring is the time when the villagers are most burdened, the food is not much left, the chickens are also thin and thin, and even the eggs can not be a few. Siegel did not let them turn in gold and silver at this time, and even the grain was not collected, but instead spent money to buy it. This benevolent behavior made the villagers feel very strange and began to speculate and question the lord's ability. Originally, Siegel asked the villagers to serve in labor, and the number of people working near the camp is now less and less, even if they work, they become lazy. Fazak discovered the signs and reported the situation to Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the people in the village come to the mine." Siegel simply confessed this sentence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Fitzak brought the prestigious villagers from the three villages to the striped mountain early, standing next to the camp where the half-orc miners lived. . The early half-orcs pointed at them, and also naughtyly scared them with their ugly faces, or challenged these human villagers with the treacherous warfare in the orc language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all arranged by Mike. He wanted to do this after he heard the rumors in the village. The half-orc feels very difficult to understand for the weird idea that humans question Siegel's ability. Shouldn't a powerful mage be feared? It is no wonder that the Walled Mountain Range is also known as the Sheepfold Mountain Range. It is true that the human beings are just stupid lambs and can only obey under the sticks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fazak, when will our lord adults arrive?" Intimidation. The team gradually became scattered, some people began to look around, others tried to hide behind others. However, Fazak did not take care of them, but just looked at the operation of the gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of construction. The Zebra Mountain Gold Mine has gradually taken shape. From the cliff platform to the foot of the mountain, a stepped passage is made of wood, and the pipeline for transporting the ore soil is basically laid. The slings that were originally built on them did not have suitable pulleys and were worn out and could not be used. Siegel has not yet thought of a solution. So ordered the construction of the slide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the camp, an alchemy workshop is under construction, and Siegel puts most of his energy into this workshop. He has written to Elinte, hoping to hire a few short craftsmen who know how to smelt gold from him, and he will use the gold produced here as a reward. The letter was sent out, but there is no response yet, and Siegel has to continue to adhere to the original plan. He is setting up an alchemy matrix that uses the power of magic to extract gold from ore. But he can't solve the problem of magical power, and he can only rely on his own strength to run the battlefield every time. He does not want to be a goldsmith and craftsman for a lifetime, and no Master will accept such employment. The progress of the alchemy workshop has been slow. Now it is only the outermost wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel in the unformed alchemy workshop, secretly observed the villagers brought by Fitzak, watching them noisy. Janet was by his side, carefully preparing the Lord's clothes and sabre for him. "It’s just ignorant farmers," Janet said. "They haven’t seen such a handsome lord after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don’t make me laugh, for a while I have to treat them with serious faces.” Siegel licked his cheeks and his body began to grow again. Now there is a sign of a beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet carefully cares for his face and trims his hair and beard with Siegel's popular makeup. Sewing clothes by hand. For these things, the kittens are happy and immersed in happiness. When Siegel goes to the alchemy workshop or casts magic, she goes to the castle site. I measured the land over and over again, planning the layout with my own experience of diving into the castle, and striving to secure my home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not like a nobleman. I was a sailor on the ship a year ago." Siegel said: "But I understand what you mean. Janet, I want them to know what the Master Lord is."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel summons the phantom and rides lightly. The cloak behind him was windless, and the squid with his black flame burning was gently twisting the tentacle. The mage wears a fitting brown-red short leather coat with a family badge made of gold on the chest. The black dragonskin leather pants are enclosed in the flip-flops, and the silver runes are used to draw the magic runes of the light spirits. As long as Siegel concentrates and introduces magical energy into the rune, you can omit the action and sound of the spell and use this spell directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom sees the master's mind, swiftly sweeping through the camp, leaving a silver afterimage behind him. It stopped in front of the villagers, a mane, and a breath of sparkling stars in his nose. The mage patted the head of the summoned object, turned it into black smoke, and sent it back to the shadow world. When the smoke dissipated, Siegel flew down from the air and stood silently in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has bowed their heads and said, "The Lord of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come with me, there are some things to talk to you." Siegel held the hilt with one hand and the other with the markings on the mountain. He said, "I heard that you are very strange, I don't know if I am here." What are you doing on the mountain. Now I tell you: this is a gold mine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the news of the gold mine has long been given by Siegel, by Fitzgerald Ke quietly spread out. On the one hand, it attracts attractive businessmen, on the other hand, I want to see if there will be a robber. After more than half a month, the surrounding area was still calm, so Siegel decided to officially announce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you don't know what the gold mine means," Siegel continued. "For you, it's farming cattle, seeds, fertilizer, mills, Roads and markets. But these have only one premise, that is obedience. Those who are best at farming and raising, can live near my castle in the future, and give priority to these things. I don't know farming. But I know that only efforts You can get the life you want. Think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers stalked behind Siegel, obviously not listening to them - they Most of the attention was drawn to the singular cloak of the lord. Everyone’s mind has been thinking about what kind of fabrics and craftsmanship can produce such magical effects, so only the words “gold mine, cattle and mill” have entered their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought for a moment. Understood the original reason. I think Janet and I think too complicated. After all, Heimchu is just a backcountry. The villagers here have not seen the caster like the residents of Deepwater, or have an intuitive understanding of magic. His own phantom, smart suit and squid cloak can achieve good results in Sham Shui Po, but it is too high-end and difficult for local people to understand. The results have had little effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned and faced the people who followed him, his voice was low and powerful: "I don't want to be a lord without a castle, because that means I don't have the power and majesty. From now on, there must be enough labor. Whether in accordance with the laws of the Star Kingdom or the practice of Deepwater City, every farmer should work for me for at least 60 days a year, as a militia or a worker. It’s time to see that this work is done by volume. Fitzker will count and coordinate this matter, and I don’t want to hear any excuses.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, He took out his wand and began to cast spells in front of everyone. This is more than half a month. Siegel has been honing his elemental summoning skills at the mine, and his mastery of the characteristics of earth elements is becoming more and more sophisticated. The villagers felt that the land under their feet was constantly shaking, and the soil became active and turned into mud and rushed toward Siegel. They wanted to run away, but they found that their feet were trapped in the soil and they could not move. Several people fell into the flowing muddy water and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel draws a circle of different sizes in the air with a wand, and the sound of the spell changes. The soil gathered in front of him and gradually formed a tall human form. In a short while, as the soil solidifies. A large earth element appears in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to work!" Siegel ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth element snorted and then took a heavy step towards the striped mountain. The Orc miners shouted in unison, expressing their excitement with whistle and crappy voices. Every time the earth element comes out, it is to assimilate the hardest rock. Excavate the most difficult mountain. This means that the half-beasts have reduced the difficulty of their work and are less risky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
