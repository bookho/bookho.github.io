			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s hair is softly tucked on the head, and it’s not too long to turn around, looking at the round eyes and looking around. Shouldn't you be able to distinguish something farther away? Like Siegel, he has black hair and black eyes. From him, he has not found the physical features of the demon, and seems to have completely smeared the traces of Siegel's weird blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses Isaac as the child's name: Isaac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s attracted by the strange smell of the caster’s cast material. The little guy can always find his father’s position accurately and reach out in this direction. If Siegel doesn't grab the outstretched hand, Isaac will burst into tears soon. He has a strange ability, even if Siegel hides the twenty-faced scorpion with a spell, he can still grasp it accurately. He curiously slammed it and squeezed it twice to return the thing to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet was completely occupied, and life became very busy. She does not want to be a fake maid, and her own children take care of themselves. At the beginning, I was always in a hurry, but the next day I was very different. It’s rare for Siegel to completely drop the spells and spells, stay away from the study and the spell lab, and stay with his family. Looking at Isaac, Siegel only thinks that he is the most perfect creation in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy is very active, his hands always like to grab a variety of things, so Siegel gave him some soft leather toys. But his favorite is the Raven Baron, who is rich in tame and obedient. Siegel asked the magic pet to look at the little guy and use the soul connection to report changes in the surrounding environment at any time, so that the child can know the first time whether he is hungry or annoyed. I didn't expect the devil to become Isaac's toy. He always kept the raven's feathers and then pinched its belly. Fortunately, Baron's feathers were tough, and the baby's strength could not hurt it, so he played by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is busy, Janet solves the problem of eating and drinking for children, Siegel is responsible for finding good toys, the servants clean up the room and let Isaac have a Warm growing environment. However, the happiness of a family is only a short day. On the third day of the war, Siegel began to get busy. He had to take over the size of Heim’s leadership and restore jurisdiction. He first summoned the female knight Mana. Looking at the report she had drafted with a twisted handwriting. Mana will circle the knights and knights who are well-behaved in the battle, and ask the lord to reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These martial arts are high and low, but they have always been loyal to Heim, and they are all honorable people." The knight said: to promote them to the territory It will be very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the list and pointed to several names: "Kenke is not the one with the left ear." There are burns on the chin? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he came from the town of Skater, a hired knight. Fighting heroic in the Guard and being able to save the injured companion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Grenada, I can't remember." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He came to the city of Mith after you left. He took his family, including six lively boys. Because he could not afford the aristocratic registration tax, his father’s title could not be extended to him, so he lost his land and went to the New World to discuss his life. "Mana is very clear about the situation of each of her men. She spent a lot of effort to remember this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put the list aside, Staring at the knight with sharp eyes until Mana coughed twice because of uneasiness. "Do you have any instructions, Lord Lord?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there no name for you and Jack? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two of us have been sealed as knights and able to command the army. It is already a very high honor." Fighting for you is something you should have, and you don't need a different reward. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "Without your name, this paper is waste paper." Although you are a knight, there are jazz on it. I am just a baron, so I can only promote you to the Jazz. This situation will definitely change, and you should not worry. But to be a jazz. It must also pass my test. He took out his wand, read the spell, and used the illusion to draw a map around Heim's collar on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will happen to the situation in the South after this war?" . Let's talk about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana wrinkled her brow and thought about it, then cleared her throat and said in a firm tone: "Most of the southern lords have only one castle." The little lords, some of them only have manors, only simple walls instead of walls. After the battle, the small lords who participated in the battle are likely to be devastated. It was annexed by the Uther family, which was almost intact. I think Uther is likely to shake hands with the viscount of the Kamei House, and take advantage of this opportunity to expand the site. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded. "Can they unify the south?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible, no one will sit and watch them win without fighting." Mana pendulum I waved my hand and said: "I didn't understand it at first, but now I think that the command of the Lord's lord to stop chasing is very important to the situation. Many southern lords have kept their own army, and their heirs will hold a group. To resist the annexation of the Uther family. This will be another force for a while, but over time, it is hard to say whether they will end up like the Southern Alliance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel said: "What should we do as we straddle the ore avenue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is pointing The map, stern to the Siegel, said: "We should quickly go south, occupy or control the castle of Dalung, the Enkat Cliffs Manor and the Forest of Sol Forest. In addition to expanding the territory, it can also form sufficient peripheral protection. Even if The Sur family wants to find trouble with us. There is also enough reaction time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But our strength is just to guard the home, if you attack, you can only occupy a place. But if If the Lord of the Lord can go out together, I have the confidence to take these three places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and looked at the horsewoman Mana and said: You have been with me since Mackabu, and now you can be alone. If you are a lord and a general, I am not as good as you, I am only by the convenience of the Master. From now on, you will be My left hand, the responsibility of acting as the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana knees down on one knee and bows her head deeply: "I will not lose your trust, for Heim’s collar is the ultimate force for the squid family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I want you to do two things. The first is to arrange a closed ceremony, just follow you. The list of reports. Plus, I will personally seal the knight tomorrow. The second is to prepare for the attack. In addition to Dalung Castle, Enkat Cliffs Manor and Sol Forest, you will also take down the town of Mosache on the edge of the Rift Valley and the Castle of the Stars next to the Red Bird Lake. The dwarf Elinette is in Mora巅 Organized a group of hundreds of mercenaries. It will arrive around the day after tomorrow, that is your strength.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana looked up, “mercenary If you fight, it is easy to have problems with the military discipline. Both looting and ** can happen. It is also difficult for them to persist in the siege battle, and they will not have strong fighting spirit in the face of setbacks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell the few people who will be sealed tomorrow." They are responsible for leading the mercenaries to fight. After laying down the castle, in addition to Dalong and Enkat, you will award the other three castles according to their performance and choose a new city owner. Knowing that this will be their future territory, these people will fight hard and bind the mercenaries to prevent damage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about Dalong Castle and Enkat Cliff Estate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was for you and Zucker, but you also know that if the Orcs manage the castle, he will make a mess there. Therefore, Zucker stayed in the city of Mire, coordinating the relationship with the half-orc. And you need to pay more attention to the overall situation of the territory, especially when I study spells, I will exercise the power of the lord, so I will not send you to the castle outside. Fitzak will be responsible for these two places, and the cliff manor used to support the elderly is said to be very good. You two pay more Fazak some pensions, and other territorial incomes are yours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition," Siegel continued: "After you complete the occupation, give the Baron Huge of Vaughan in my name." write a letter. Let him choose whether he is loyal to Uther or loyal to me. At the time when Viscount Uther attacked Heim. His enthusiasm helped bring us victory. This thing Uther will know sooner or later, so ask his opinion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana nodded, "This way." We will be able to expand ten times in size, and because we have defeated Uther, we still have the victory in the face of the coalition, so it will become the strongest of the southern lords. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel agrees: "You are right." Only in this way can we have enough voice. In addition to protecting ourselves, we need to let the entire South take our influence. Do not build a magic tower for the Knox Association. The real enemy has not yet shot, you know that there will be battles in the future. However, this matter cannot be said clearly. You tell them that all the magic towers in the South must be approved by me, otherwise they will be regarded as a challenge to Heim. Don't care if other lords are dissatisfied, as long as they can execute it. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
