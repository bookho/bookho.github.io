			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parchments in front of Siegel, one is the scroll of the summoning element, and the other is the soil element reinforcement written by the dwarf runes. . Dwarves often use this rune spell on walls, ceilings, walls, ceilings, etc., allowing them to stay longer in time. The rune will also be used extensively in Siegel's castle, but his idea is to use it on earth elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area that has never been set before, so Siegel is worried about the consequences of this attempt. He also clearly remembers the result of the last use of the Vision, and if it is not the scorpion, it must be a life. After learning about this, Janet was very worried. After all, there were too many stories about the death of the wizard in the spell test, and this time they are close to them. But Elinte prevented everyone from persuading Siegel and told them very seriously: "This is something that Siegel must take for himself. You can't interfere with him. Like a general who goes out, he must be right. I have absolute confidence - even the wrong confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf runegrapher Taklin and Elinette whispered, not knowing what to discuss. Elinette shook his head frequently and seemed to disagree with each other's views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger gently slipped over the sheepskin roll, and the place where the text was written gave him a familiar touch. For these two spells, Siegel has checked many times, and every detail is deeply imprinted in the mind. The two actually have something in common, but it is difficult to express them with words other than magic and runes. Siegel believes that these commonalities are the secret between spells and divine power, and are the essential source of various power systems in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposition is too big, and Siegel thinks, should still focus on the problem at hand. He carefully thought through the whole experiment and decided to proceed in a more secure way. Applying rune technology directly while summoning the earth element, there may be more errors and a greater chance of failure. Not...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thought of using the flame implement as the core and summoning the four-armed fire element. With the core of the spell, all the modifications to the spell have a stable platform. Thinking of this, he put away two reels. Go out of the camp and shout out to your followers. "Mol, go to Fazak and say that I want gold, silver, iron ingots and tin. Let him prepare for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young followers Nodded and ran out of stride. Regardless of the other advantages of Moore, it is very convenient to run fast. Siegel teaches him basic swords and riding skills every day, increasing his vocabulary and math skills. Moore did not learn quickly - compared to Siegel - but he worked very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the fast Moore ran back. Hands hold what the lord needs. Siegel took it with a smile and rewarded him for drinking some wine. In the closed camp, the Master calmed down, taking gold as the core, and other materials as an aid, began to create the summoning device of the earth element magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to stability, Siegel can't think of anything else that needs to be added. I have taught in the course of the Masters Federation that each spell test should only find one direction as much as possible to eliminate interference from other factors. He meticulously portrayed as soon as possible, whispering a curse. Use precise control to fuse the magic array required by the instrument. Although he has always warned himself to be calm, the magic test that is about to be carried out has made him nervous, leading to several mistakes in the process of making the instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down his golden scepter, took a deep breath and opened the curtain to the outside of the camp. "Mor, give me a chair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young attendant rushed to serve the lord, and placed a small table in addition to the chair. There are some wines in the pottery jug, and gold-plated horns next to them. Siegel did not drink because it would continue to reduce his spell control. He took a long pipe from his arms. Ignite the smoked tobacco leaves and start meditation in the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mood became calm, he returned to the camp to continue his previous work. This time he finally stopped making mistakes and made the craftsmanship used for summoning precise and complete. This work is time consuming. It has already entered the night when it is finished. Kitty Janet came to dinner, a large plate of delicious food. It includes crispy hot bread, ham, squid apple pie and a roast chicken. Siegel asked: "Have you eaten yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny features nod, but Siegel does not believe. He asked Moore to take a knife and fork and give the roast chicken the waiter. Then, with Janet's company, he let go of his belly and had a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there any danger?” she asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Siegel replied: "The spell may be out of control, may explode, or summon a twisted and dangerous earth element monster, these are The problem can be estimated. But there is no other risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you not do it?" Janet asked cautiously: " Isn't it just as good with the current method? Gold mines can produce 100 gold coins every day, and more and more will be in the future. Should these be enough for you to learn spells?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In terms of money, it is enough." Siegel replied: "But being a good mage always takes this risk. Just like you have to complete a task, whether it is stealing intelligence or something else, you don't need it. Face the unknown difficulties?” He cut a few slices of ham and chewed it in his mouth. "Well, I am full, my body and my spirits have been relaxed, and the state is just right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The good news that I am waiting for you?" Janet Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I wish everything goes well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel came to a far from the barracks On the open field, there were four dwarf runes and eight warriors including Taklin. If the soil elements that are summoned are not controlled, they will immediately break it into pieces. Siegel didn't want to bother them, but the dwarfs insisted that if the experiment was successful, the new technology represented could not be considered by Siegel alone, and the dwarf also had some rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you said makes sense. I can't think of such an idea without you." Siegel said to the dwarves while arranging the summoning circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dwarf retreated, Siegel began to recite the spell. In order to summon the circle of law, the magic of the earth elements constantly gathers on the core of the instrument, and at the same time the power of the dwarf runes is also triggered, like the red soldering iron, leaving a mark on the magic channel. It is very difficult to maintain the stability of the channel in this situation. After all, there are forces from multiple sources that are fighting. Siegel tried to slow down the completion rate of the spell, in order to stabilize the first priority. The magical energy is compressed into a trickle that slowly converges toward the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth elements are gradually forming, which is stronger and firmer than usual. This is the special effect of the instrument, and stability is overwhelming. From the rock gaps that make up the earth elements, from the muddy blood flowing through it, you can see the flash of the dwarf runes. Siegel uses both the heart and the heart, while manipulating the wizard's magic and the dwarf's runes, and strives to achieve harmony and balance between the two. After more than ten minutes of uninterrupted spelling, the final spell was successfully completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves want to go forward to observe this earth element, but they are stopped by Siegel. He began to issue orders to the summons to test security. In accordance with the instructions of the Master, the earth elements swayed their arms, raised their knees, stood upside down, and even made two sit-ups. Then Siegel threw a few stones over the ground and let the earth elements smash them in the air. But when hitting the last piece, Siegel suddenly ordered the earth element to stop, and his summoning was immediately followed, without any delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone has a heavy blow on its head, leaving a dent, and the earth element is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until to this extent, Siegel and the dwarf rune masters came forward to observe. They saw the rune in the body of the earth element in a strange way of existence, gradually gathered toward the core of the instrument, connected to form a complete stable rune. The time of the existence of earth elements has also been greatly extended, and there are still no signs of disintegration after more than ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tommond, you try its strength!" Dwarf Runner Taklin gave the battlefield to a dwarf warrior and asked Siegel Ordered to let the earth elements attack. Although the elemental creatures have tremendous strength and endless endurance, the clumsy mobility of the earth elements makes its attacks all fail. The dwarf Tomond hammered the warhammer again and again on the opponent, and the rock and the mud were knocked down. The elements that are firmly controlled by the stable runes are not signs of violent movements due to injury, or a pattern that is not slow or slow and attacks at the original rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This earth element still achieves the strength of the original normal summoning spell." Siegel said to the dwarf: "It is good progress to extend the duration." But the materials used to make the core of the spell make it too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just the first experiment, we dwarves too It is impossible to let every crossbow's swing dig into the ore.” The dwarf runeman comforted him and said, “The battle experiment is here, let's continue to look at its duration.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
