			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few records in the library about the magic tower, and it is even less likely to have a record of how to pass each layer or to indicate weaknesses in each layer. ● Hey, Siegel has decided that there are no shortcuts from here, but can only think of other ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you know now is that each layer has a core, or a lamp god, or an important magic device. Through these cores, the user can know the specific role of each layer and perform certain operations. Predicting that the crystal ball is temporarily inaccessible, the core of the sixth layer of Warcraft Wild has not been found. These two things are likely to be related to the seventh floor of the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the guidance of the Lord of the Rings, the magical power of the magic god is in the interior of the tower, the direction of the seventh floor. Siegel spent half a day searching for records on the seventh floor, but only found "through the sixth floor of the ladder and test, you can go to the seventh floor, where you learn the core secrets of magic, knowledge and prophecy rules. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost a magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be any way to go up, Siegel thought. Even if Lear blocked all the passages at the beginning, the power of the priesthood and the fire would be adjusted over time. Shenhuo hopes that a new magical god will be born, so it will definitely break through the obstacles and create a way to integrate and enlighten God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know what Lear actually did, according to the general logic, he will not stay behind. It is like building a levee on a large river. If it is completely sealed, the river will one day rush to dam, and it will be completed in an unpredictable way in an unpredictable time. Only leave a downward road. In order to keep the dam for a longer period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Siegel has to do is to find a way to find this path. Or simply destroy the dam. This is not the general situation. What he has to face is the architecture left by the gods of magic, knowledge and prophecy. Is it possible to do this by virtue of his own savvy and ability?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deeply pondered. Among the Masters, knowledge and strength determine many things, and all casters want to become stronger. More intelligent. And the one who is a big one is not someone else, it is the god of magic. Siegel has already learned the power of Lear, manipulating the human heart, studying the behavior patterns of the Master, and grasping their weaknesses. In these aspects, Siegel sighs. If you want to go down this road and rely on your own efforts to achieve transcendence, the difficulty is really too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is this the only way, maybe only a different angle of thinking can solve the current dilemma. Siegel stopped reading and learning, and sorted out if he had any omissions. He has to make an important decision. I have to consider all aspects before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed in the Magic Tower for a day and a night, and other students knew this, and they all thought about it. No one wants to fall behind in this matter. Everyone knows that the higher the reward on the tower, the better. A long-time old Master can go up to the second floor so soon that Anna knows that Siegel has more than three layers and that he does have some unique skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are simply envious. Some people are a little embarrassed and some are dissatisfied. In such a place where competition pressure is huge, there is a danger of life and death at any time. Even a wizard with wisdom may not be able to perfectly adjust emotions. The seeds of suspicion and violence slowly sprout and grow in the hearts of everyone, affecting their way of action unconsciously, and eventually form a terrible whirlpool of fratricidalism, engulfing all the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lear is here. Siegel wants to break this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Sigel came to the classroom in advance. He is still a negative score now and can no longer be deducted for absenteeism. He did not sit in the seat, but stood by the podium. Other students came one after another. As the flame gnome and another mage died, the rest of the people became very careful, especially guarding Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you standing on, the teacher is coming soon." Elf Anna stumbled as she walked in from the outside and hurriedly reminded me. "If you are obstructing the lecture, you will be deducted a lot of points. Don't make a mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head and he knew he still had a few minutes. When the masked worm master entered the classroom again and walked straight to the edge of the seat, Siegel cleared his throat and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence blew in the classroom like a blue sky, and everyone stood up from the seat because of surprise. Their faces are shocked, suspicious, and excited. No one in the presence is a fool, they guess that the old Master must have more important things to disclose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Ou Luoyin Kuluer, which is of course a pseudonym. The first thing you do when you come here is to change your appearance and disguise your identity. Get a pseudonym." Siegel stared and stood straight. "Then, the lamp god immediately came over and reminded us to protect our true identity so as not to cause unnecessary danger. This tense atmosphere makes everyone jealous of each other and form a vicious circle in the battle."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden identity is not absolutely a bad thing, but I found that the lamp god was tampered with, and the entire magic school was artificially distorted. I will come up with tangible evidence. But now everyone listens to me. If you continue to follow the rules trap set by the conspirators, I am afraid that no one will become a winner, and even surviving is a luxury." Siegel swept from everyone's face. I looked at them with a candid look, and then said arbitrarily: "I chose the detachment rule, no longer bound by this place, but acted according to my own heart. I am called Siegel squid, curse teacher, Heim. The lord of the collar and the Marquis of the starry kingdom. I don’t need you to uncover identity like me, I just hope someone can work with me to crack this situation. As I said, continue to singles. Bucket, and consume each other down, never have appeared winner "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he snapped his fingers with his Transfiguration." Change back to original form. " At this time, the lecturer came to the classroom, a strong middle-aged man with a black staff and a tattoo on his head. He used a rough voice to make Siegel give way, otherwise he would deduct the score. Siegel knew that he didn't have to fight against the lecturer. So he went down from the podium and found an empty seat to sit down and attend classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides him. No one can calm down and listen to this class. To be honest, what the teacher told today is very practical, especially for the wizard who uses the staff as the main casting tool, you can learn a lot of combat experience. He eloquently tells, while summoning illusion enemies and working hard to demonstrate. However, the students present at the scene still turned their attention to the young students who sat in the seat. The guy named Siegel squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s never been like this. Everyone is looking forward to the end of class time. Everyone has a lot of questions to ask, about the magic tower's function, about camouflage identity, about the so-called tampering, but the most concerned about how to learn more here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you speak to everyone in class, you will be overwhelmed by these problems. Siegel deliberately chose to speak before the start of the class, and then used the class to calm everyone down and make a comprehensive thinking. So when the lecturer left the classroom with the staff, no one left, everyone looked at Siegel quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, Siegel. What do you want to say?" The voice of the murderer passed through the mask, dull but soft. "How do you prove that what you said is true?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded and said: "A very critical question, how to prove what I said is true You can call your own lamp god. Ask him to provide a local welcome book. It will write about the precautions and rules of life here. Originally, this thing should be handed over to everyone, so that Everyone forms an important first impression. But this thing has been tampered with, and no one knows his existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone acts according to words and calls the god of lights. These lights are still sluggish and can only act in the way of the creatures. But they have the advantage of being able to perform and complete tasks without delay. They reached out and stirred in the air. Extend your hand into the alien space and take the welcome manual from inside. It was indeed the first time that everyone saw this kind of thing, and when it was opened, it was difficult to hide the confused expression. When they finished reading, the confused expression was deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone has modified this to create difficulty from the rules. He wants us to kill each other and let the whole student fill the atmosphere of terror. I can still take With one piece of evidence, you can choose a service through the lamp god, similar to life insurance. If you pay twenty points a day, you can hide in your room with one thought and keep all dangers out."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing only needs to be checked to get the answer. The person who chooses the query has an indescribable expression on his face. The number of twenty points per day is not difficult, as long as you concentrate on the transcription of the scrolls. Such a convenient means does not have a reminder of the lamp god, but in vain put him in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
