They take I don't have any good ideas, so I will start from around me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you making arrangements at Heim's collar?" said Sir Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, unless the opponent has no bottom line attack, there is no problem there. If you develop that step, I also have the power to break the net. Currently I only Can use this method to achieve balance, and at the same time strive to develop themselves, strive to smooth out the gap between advantages, and finally get the initiative." Siegel helped the jazz poured a cup of honey with Ningshen tea, and then asked: "Jazz, you Whose road is this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill frowns: "I never wanted to understand this thing. About eight months ago, that time Hou Ewen is not a king. I just gave you Aaron’s trustee. At this time, a bandit of a group of deserters came to the vicinity of the territory, and happened to hijack the son of Earl of Turner who passed by. Waiting for me and the housekeeper of Earl of Tren When they found the robbers with money, they had killed the hostages and tried to ambush us. In that battle I found the book, The History of the Starry Kingdom, Book 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This book is the Earl Or is it a bandit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked, not belonging to the Troon family. That book and some gold and silver, as well as candlesticks, bronze mirrors, etc. Together, it may be a spoiler of a bandit's looting," Bill recalls. "When I was bored, I would look at the book and then it would start to become abnormal. It was a bit like a sleepwalking at first, then it was There is nowhere to go around, and then gradually lose control of the body, a bit like being drunk and forgetting something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a very troublesome thing, is there no pastor in your territory?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m afraid he’s also a priest with no real skills. After I’m not aware of it, I’m still I went to see him. He just said that I had a bad sleep and rest, so I gave some medicine to help me sleep, which made the situation worse.” Sir Bill’s swearing, it seems that he is still worried. "I later found out that I joined an organization called the Orthodox Church, who are plotting to kill Evan. To ensure the long-term stability of the Starry Kingdom. I am in this organization..." He lowered his voice and said: "The position is high, even though I I don't know how I climbed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The book... Have you seen the book for someone else?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no impression, but it is better to have a lot of people look at it." Sir Bill sighed and shook his head slightly: "I think things are not right. But it was already difficult to ride the tiger." The Orthodox Church was still normal at the beginning, supporting the then King Aaron, Evan... Evan did not enshrinate after all, he was an unstable person in the eyes of the Orthodox Church that affected the stability of the kingdom. The assassination plan for Evan was not implemented, who at the time He couldn't find him either. Later, Aaron sent a message to the Avon on the dwarf stone boat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I am awake Less and less. I don’t know what’s going on, I have to arrange it quickly. I tried to find a high-ranking priest at the temple, but the time I was awake was not long enough to support me to reach the temple. So in desperation, I can only divorce, hoping to keep the child. The orthodox has begun planning to kill. Evan, the rescue of Aaron and the robbing of the prince, any one is enough for the whole family to be hanged!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now it is over." Siegel put his head on On the back of the chair, looking up at the ceiling: "There is no danger, except that you have to go to the marriage proposal again. Right, you really have to go to the marriage proposal again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad boy!" Sir Bill snorted two times in his stomach: "I must be going back. I have such a chance to manage the territory, I want to create better conditions for children and families." Your Heim is really very good. I have heard a lot of rumors on the kingdom. It is said that you have the same land area as the Duke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, this is true. And there are many landless people around me who want to come out again." There is nothing wrong with the duke collar. But I have already stopped the occupation, but there are not enough people to manage it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big aristocrat still has to After a long generation of generations, you can really establish your status. In other words, you have more children. How can Janet give you one now? This is absolutely impossible.” Sir Bill grinned: “I saw her when she saw her. The physique of birth, thin and weak. You are the first person in the squid family, and now take charge of such a large territory. If there are not enough offspring to manage separately, it is likely that the power of loyalty to the knight will be greater than that of the main house. You also know that this is not a good thing. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if cloning is successful, eternal youth can be expected, and how many offspring seem to be no longer a big problem. But Sir Bill is like a parent. He used to say that Janet is not suitable for Siegel. Siegel himself has never heard of it. For a time, the ** division seems to have returned to the past, the old days of the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, how do you mix with the king’s secret probe now? It’s a very dangerous person. If you say it, you don’t know it’s true. It’s still fake, can’t believe it.” Sir Bill yelled: “Don’t you owe him? It’s said that his human condition is the hardest to return. I have nothing to do, and you will return to Heim as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shook his head: "I can't go back for a while. I was appointed as a military adviser by His Majesty the King and now works under the Count of Todd. It’s not too hard, but it’s not easy to leave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Count of Todd?” Sir Bill thought about it and then suddenly realized: “The Count of Todd is ready to Retired, so let you try your hand first, then go ahead at any time? You are likely to become the military chief of the next pre-meeting meeting. This is to study hard. This position has always been played by the king’s trusted lord. Used to calm the conflict between the lords. Not a Heim collar, the title of a ** division can also hold a lot of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I would rather be more leisurely, the goal is more Focus on it." Siegel has some helplessness: "I ended up being a magician, jazz, you didn't blame me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have had it, but now there is no Sir Bill’s smile, his eyes with a gratifying look: “I intended to let you go on the road to the Cavaliers, but I don’t really have any good way to make you a title or a lord. Maybe through the competition. The assembly, then for a big lord, then marry a high woman like me. You are not very good now, the Marquis, have their own large territory. I am only happy, I am more happy than what I have gained. When I took you off the boat, I saw it, you must be very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least not to be killed by the Kobolds as soon as they come up." Sir Bill said with a smile. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people talked for a while, Sir Bill ate some elf biscuits, then drank the drink prepared by Shelley Master, and slept again. Long time and dying, his body is affected by negative energy, many functions are not as good as before, so you need to slowly nurse. In this respect, the Necromancer is even more experienced than the pastor of the Morning Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Injury is often damaged, especially in the heart and lungs and kidneys, which requires long maintenance." Master Shelley said privately to Siegel: "If there is a morning dawn The priest of the temple helps, and it should be able to recover almost one or two months. Anyone who tells you that you can be faster is a liar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much Now, what kind of materials do you need to find me directly, I will try my best to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xingsuo returned to the star king, the king listened After the wiki's separate report, Sir Bill was called alone in the past. The Jazz was barely able to walk, but Shelley was very determined to ask him to sit in a wheelchair. In short, His Majesty saw the "worried" Sir Bill, asked him a lot of information about the orthodox, and then revealed the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Siegel is not so optimistic. Although this happened eight months ago, when Aaron and Evan had not met each other, they had not received a hundred-faced scorpion, or blocked Lear’s legendary spell at the Dwarf King’s meeting. That is to say, at that time, he did not become the enemy of the great prophet Lear. However, the time and space power on the cover of "History of the Starry Kingdom" always reminds him: he has seen himself traveling by time, that is to say, time travel is possible, then the time when the book was discovered does not guarantee that this is not a column. One of the plots of Seoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the time travel, possession of these two things as the core of the entire conspiracy, led to Sir Bill to join the orthodox will become a "rebel" threatening the kingdom rule, This creates trouble for Siegel or swears at the time of maturity. The conspiracy may not be that simple, and the deeper purpose has not yet been revealed. But from the current results, Siegel feels that he has at least solved the problem of the surface. Then there is a question in front of him: Why use this strange history book as a medium, how can he and he travel time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
