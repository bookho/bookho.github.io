			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of big and small eyes stared at Siegel, and the sound of the Peng bird rang through Tianyu. To read the other sects of the 1cc, it is far from being avoided, so as not to be directly involved in this battle. They are watching and hope to be able to take some advantage after the battle is divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the wand from his sleeve and swung his side. His movements are very gentle, just like the mother caressing the forehead of a sleeping baby, for fear of awakening a calm child. However, the surrounding elements have set off a huge wave, and the whole mountain is shaking sharply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one point does not move, that is where Siegel stands. With a wave of his left hand, he began to play a symphony of elemental power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the land. Rocks and soil form a solid foundation that carries the body of the world. A strong earthquake spread from the foot of Siegel, and there was a rift in the mountain. The accumulation of hundreds of millions of years came alive and exhaled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gas rises, mixed with the light spirit that was originally in heaven. The sand and the stone dance, the tornado hovering, and the Peng bird caught in it is like entering the cutting machine, and instantly becomes a broken blood and feather. Their wreckage dyes the tornado into gold and red, and their flesh and blood feeds a new elemental life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With soil, wind and water, let him live. Siegel kept chanting curses, his voice was powerful and powerful, mixed with the raging of the tornado. Huge energy gathered from his chest and squeezed out of the lungs. Siegel, like a dragon, spurted a black flame. The flame turned into a black phoenix, and the golden, red and brown tornado was drilled in the exhilarating and mad laughter of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow of lightning flashes in the wind, like a tentacle slamming out, breaking the clouds and lighting the sky. Birds and beasts that are too late to escape, whether it is Dapeng or Xiangshi, are the targets of this iridescent tentacle. No one can run the lightning, no one can stand the rainbow, so the rain drops in the sky. In the fleshy and fragrant rain, Siegel becomes the king of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters in the swamp squat down quietly, clinging their heads against the muddy black water. ?? 壹 reading ww?w·1?k?anshu·cc they fear the power of the elements. More awesome people who can make this power. Their vision is obscured by dazzling lightning, their hearing is submerged by roaring thunder, and only the elements of their sense of smell bring their pressure and fear. Although they can't see the sound and appearance of Siegel, they all know it clearly. The lonely mountain, in the place where the shining dragon rolls stand, is death, an unshakable possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has finally had enough power and space to complete the elemental aggregate he designed in meditation. He spurred the surrounding elements and energy, and was then moved by their laughter and laughter. The excitement and tremor that magic brings through the body is hard to hold. This is a feeling of happiness, just like holding the world in your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell's movement has entered the **, the four elements chorus in unison, the sound penetrates the cloud, reaching above the void. A huge elemental polymer that has never been seen before in the world has emerged. It does not have its own will, it has no soul and thought, it is still waiting for its true birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways to get it alive, and Siegel knows it. One is the way of the Golem, just like the four elements of the Dragon and Lion Cliff, they form a balance between separation and combination. The intelligence to deal with various problems was born. One is the method of the lamp god, using the power of limited wishing and necromantic magic to create a smart core, obedience and service. There is also a method of colloidal warriors, using the spirit as a template, splitting the soul, engraving skills, from death to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the fourth method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the tetrahedral elemental aggregate and released the Raven Baron from the space in the sleeve. He listens to his own warnings in the future, and never try to integrate his will into elements or magic spells, which will definitely lead to the loss of humanity. So Siegel decided to use the magic pet to rule his own elemental aggregate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using shared soul links. He uses the technique of engraving to let Barron understand how to balance the power of the element; using the spell and the squad, he allows the elemental tetrahedron to permanently store a mechanical soul born of limited wishing, responsible for sharing the work of manipulating the massive elements; Use the technology of the Golem, and it is a combination of the flesh-and-blood golem and the elemental golem. To read the book, 1?k?a book nshu·cc makes the tetrahedron and Baron's body blend together, complement each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barron’s body is constantly inflated, and the black soft feathers, which are less than five inches long, are now becoming long-swords with shiny metallic luster. Under the blade of dense clumps, iridescent radiance shines on the tough scales. The energy of the element is tightly integrated with its **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical pet is originally the creation of magic, the best combination of spells and flesh and blood, even more suitable for the power of carrying elements than the Master. So the power of the Raven Baron to absorb the elemental polymer is adventurous, but not impossible, and Siegel is still assisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed the spell and began to sing the magic pot spell. This spell extracts the soul from the body of a creature and seals it into an item. Siegel excerpts its fragments, controlling the power of the elements to aggregate the storm, and not letting it create the original and chaotic mind - even if the high concentration of elements is born, it will immediately become the nutrition of the Raven Baron, helping it to master the body together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, Barron is like a giant black bird, and the elemental storm circling between its wings. The lightning came out and burned its feathers, and it was unaware; the whirlwind, sand and dust could not hurt it, and the fragments of flesh and feathers were swallowed up by Baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raven's black eyes flashed with iridescent light, and as it continued to combine with the storms of the sky, it grew long tail feathers behind it. The tail feathers are thin and long, like ribbons flying behind them. It presents a variety of colors in the eyes of Siegel and is constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballon’s head also has four solid feathers that symbolize the four elements. It becomes a strange and beautiful unique creature with powerful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t be called a raven now, and it’s not a complete magical pet. To be precise, Barron is a new existence between elements, magical pets and golems. When Siegel stepped forward, Baron lowered his head and placed his side face in Siegel's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so big, how come back to the city of Mith?" Siegel said to him with a smile. Barron has had his own consciousness, his eyes smashed, and then began to get smaller. It softens the feathers, hides the tail feathers and the crown, and turns the iridescent blend in the eyelids into pure black, pretending to be the former raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really smart," Siegel said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person, one bird, strolling on the mountain, no beasts dare to bother. There are some eggs of the birds in the cracks of the rocks. Their parents either fled or were twisted into powder by the elemental tornado and entered the belly of Barron. Siegel opened the space bag and loaded dozens of these eggs into it. Peng birds are a kind of tamed creatures, and their huge size and flying ability are very popular in some places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the mountain where the earthquake broke open, and his eyes passed through the deep darkness to the inner core of the rock. He saw the shining gemstones and the Milky Way formed by Mithril, and he also clearly felt the residual power of the elements of Pangbow here. These gemstones can be used as a very good "fuel" if they are placed in the Peruvian nuclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel took the sign of the Federation from the space bag, and after a while, Verwood opened the portal and came to the land. From the traces of the scene, there was an elemental war here, and there are still traces of powerful spells left in the surrounding air, and the bloody smell is like a shadow. Wywood swallowed, and he seemed to hear the screams of countless creatures before they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel 师师, here is the lonely mountain mentioned by William **?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is here, look at this vein, this is just a little fur on the outside." Siegel pointed his finger and said to Verwood: "Just set up the camp here, can you see it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are earth element rune guards, where camps can be built, I think there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My idea is that there is no more construction here than just building a bunker. It is enough to protect the surrounding area." Siegel said: "William said that he had seen a dragon near here. So, be careful. The construction on the surface of the mountain is not as safe as the interior of the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weewood smiled and shook his head, he thought Sigel was It is difficult to get rid of the title of "Civil Lord". By now, Siegel is also focusing on the terrain, judging the direction of the veins, and finding the right depth and direction of excavation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
