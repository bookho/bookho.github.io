			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only one time of thought, Siegel turned himself into a beggar. The stiletto pierced the robes and passed through the middle of the third and fourth ribs until they pierced the cloak behind them. Siegel opened his mouth and made a silent laughter. The shaking jaws with the flames jumping in the blink of an eye made the whole scene look terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves are terrified, but the screams are absorbed by the silent runes. He tried to draw a fine sword, but Siegel squirmed his body. He resisted the pain from the bones and twisted the sword from Haian with his spine and ribs. At the same time, he kicked a foot on the chest of the half-elf and took advantage of the long sword that was clamped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai An stepped back and then slammed his wings. He wants to take the opportunity to fly into the sky and pull away from Siegel. Let this stupid boy stay in the silent enchantment, and he can strike from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel jumped up and grabbed Hai'an's ankle. The half-elf kicked hard and wanted to take the mage off. A force with the characteristics of earth elements passed from the ankle and quickly flowed through the body of the half-elf dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this spell? Hai'an was still in doubt, and found himself forced to deform. The dragon wing turned into mud, and the body became soft and sticky, and it could no longer fly. Siegel sees the "soft mud form" spell effective, and immediately releases his hand, rolling the unloading force on the ground, while avoiding the scope of the "mud sea hai" drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud has no fixed shape and can easily cross narrow caves and gaps. However, those who are forced to become mud can't use martial arts, and they can't use spell gestures. With the addition of silent runes, Hai'an completely lost the ability to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common attack method for mud monsters is to roll up enemy enemies and kill them with powerful digestive power. However, Hai'an is a slender half-elf, and he has only a small pile of mud, which is far from the size required to wrap Sigel. And he can't move as fast as when he has legs, it's impossible to catch up with Siegel's movement speed,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spell won't last long, but Siegel is enough to do some hands and feet. He portrayed the dwarf runes in the air and ordered the surrounding earth to gather according to his heart. Become a long cylinder. Although this twisting deformation will not hurt the "mud pirate Hai'an", Siegel then waved a long sword and cut the long cylinder into seven segments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent rune dissipates at this time and the sound reappears in this area. Then I heard Siegel slamming out a dirt column. While cursing, spread the mud that tries to reconnect. Although Hai'an does not feel pain at the moment, he knows how it will end if he did not get together before the end of the metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will certainly not let him do so, an ice wall separates the north and south ends of the yard. Hai'an desperately felt the process of the fading of the spells, manipulating the remaining body and nodding to Siegel. Signaling for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this half-elf mage knows too much about Siegel’s secrets, elemental rune guards, undead deformations, dwarf runes, so Siegel won’t leave him Life. "Secret is the greatest reliance of the Master," Siegel gently recited this sentence, and then lifted the soft mud deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai'an body is turned into a meat sauce, blood is full of yards, and the cruel death makes Siegel feel nausea. He jumped onto the ice wall, avoiding the blood on the ground and the indistinguishable body wreckage, and then quietly cast earth elemental spells to keep the surrounding land tumbling. The flesh and fat fertilizer is buried deep underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are hundreds of cockroaches flipping the ground together, the courtyard is cleaned very quickly - but the vegetation on the surface is also buried in the soil. In the yard, the yards are all newly turned up. Siegel lifted the ice wall and easily fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of silvery white leaves fell and landed on the new soil. Siegel picked it up and received it in his pocket. It is this piece of fallen leaves that makes Siegel doubtful. Siegel walked along the path, surrounded by the tree of new hope, which is said to never wither, and saw plants that had overcome the changing seasons and never saw a fallen leaf. Obviously the elves are very focused on maintaining these trees and keeping them in the best condition. Can be biased here in Hai'an. The fascinating tree drops the leaves, and even the magical fluctuations above become weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time here is that the elves will not let their own French trees fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the woman still lying on the bushes, still in a coma, but it shouldn't be a problem from her breathing. In her memory, there are traces of rude revisions by the Knox Commonwealth spell, and the unique magical imprint of Siegel does not identify errors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will continue to sleep for a while here." Siegel turned and entered the half-elf house. There is only one room inside. The kitchen and bedroom are integrated. There was simple furniture in the house, and it was very clean and there was no dust. The clothes of the two people are neatly stacked in the bedside cabinet, exuding the unique aroma of clean clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under Siegel’s detection magic, it’s another scene: the elemental spell is attached to the door lock of the closet, and it will be flamed when it is opened. Burning; there is an alarm under the drawer of the desk, which will inform the owner of the arrival of the thief; if someone checks the basket hanging on the beam of the house, it will trigger the organ of the fireplace, the poison powder will fall into the burning flame, the poison gas generated Will solve the thief in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage to suppress spells, Siegel constantly casts a magic spell in the house, dismantling these traps. Although the half-elf's spell ability is higher than Siegel, the spell he sets can only be fixed, unable to change state and counterattack. After Siegel confirmed the safety in the house, he opened the cabinet and drawer and turned the contents out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a purse, there is nothing in the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves are very cautious, setting a trap but not storing anything that can cause suspicion. Or those items that are kept as Master are on him, and the soft mud deformation destroys the structure of those items. In particular, the swords that Siegel cut off the oozes eventually destroyed the possibility of reunion, and he could not find any spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a wave of magic outside the house, I don’t know if it was a wizard or a pastor. Siegel rushed out of the space bag to take out a magical book of the Knox Association. He had been collecting the book in the town of Bacon for a long time. He had already read it thoroughly and all the spells were printed in his mind. in. He took the weight of the book and then went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Temple of the Moon and the Master of the School of Art came together, and the light of the detective spell enveloped the entire yard. As the essence of magical fluctuations sweeping through Sigel's body like a wave, all the spells on him are removed. Siegel narrowed his eyes and saw the elf hair coming to the courtyard and the shining starlight reflected in his eyes. Under the blessing of the power of the spell, he exuded a kind of awkward temperament. An elf wearer's metal armor, the emblem of Luna is engraved on his breastplate, and a long-handed scimitar with an exaggerated curve hangs behind him. The other is wearing a silver-white mage robes, a small ball of light of the same color floating around the body, the golden hair is windless and automatic, and flutters slowly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people belong to the elves who are beautiful and faceless, and it is difficult to see their age. Siegel put the spellbook under his arm and spread his hands and went out: "I am the official mage of the Mage Federation, Siegel. The squid, it is not malicious to come to Isloris."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest priest nodded and sprinkled the blessings of Luna to this area, and all evil would be invisible. Siegel exudes a soft white glow, and the patron saint of the elf thinks he has a kind and friendly soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do with Isleris?" The Elf priest asked: "Have you seen the evil undead?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that it has turned into an enchantment of the Elven Forest, and this vibrant place will never allow the emergence of the Necromancer. Siegel is about to say what he wants, but he is alert at this time: Knox Association has sent sorcerers to Islos, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not have other eyeliners. Who can trust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came here to seek knowledge and to visit the master." Siegel changed his mind: "I didn't want to meet an attempt to control my heart here." The mage, then the battle took place. The undead he summoned produced a counterattack and killed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will be the magic of the Knox Association The book was handed to the elf priest and said, "This is his spell book, which may help you better understand his evil spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf priest with The surprised expression took over the book and then produced a disgusting mood. This is the warning that Lunaid gave him, keeping him away from the evil spell power. He handed the book to the mage with golden hair around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
