			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the previous shipyard, this time is more familiar. The mage’s summons are accurately thrown into the tool room, the dry dock brackets, and the warehouse where the wood is stacked. Zucker guessed Siegel’s thoughts, even though he wanted to get on the boat as soon as possible and leave the city with the people, but unfortunately none of them had the experience of sailing, and even the dizzy on the deck was very good – They cannot do without Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sees their anxiety in the eye, knowing that this temporarily patchwork team lacks real fighting will. He tried to shorten the time spent at the shipyard as much as possible, but he also had to keep his strength for the battles that followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-orc gladiator handed him a helmet that was taken from the dead orc. Those smarter warriors are looking for armor as much as possible, and several use planks as shields - perhaps when necessary, this mother spot can also be used as a floating board in the sea to save their lives. Siegel looked at the horned helmet in his hand, and after wearing it, he found that the eye seam was too affecting the line of sight, and he threw the helmet to the gram. As a mage on the battlefield, it is good to have a set of simple armor that does not affect the casting action. He now misses his breastplate very much, and the protection effect is very good and does not interfere with the operation of the arm. Although he could not wear armor, he picked up a long bow and arrow pot from the ground and slanted them across the back. Then he lifted the hammer and proceeded to the next shipyard according to the instructions of the raven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team followed closely behind Siegel, and everyone was almost stuck together, along the road along the coast. The squid burning in the eyes of Siegel's cloak showed the direction of progress. After bypassing a corner, the speed of travel slowed down. According to the intelligence of the magic pet, a group of orcs are in front of each other, and two witch festivals are trying to remove the threat of grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop, hide." Siegel simply issued the order: "There are about a hundred people in front, hard punch is impossible, so don't talk." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are possessed by the grievances will not use long-range weapons, and can only slash with swords at most. The dispelling power of the Witch Festival is the nemesis of the Wraith, just like throwing the burning red coal into the snow, and the two will quickly separate the winners and losers. With these enemies blocking the way, Siegel can't face confrontation. He doesn't think his 100-strong refugees can destroy the same number of orc warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put away the fire on the warhammer, changed the weapon into a growing bow, and quietly approached from the side of the battlefield. He tried to hide himself in the shadows and then sneaked at the head of the witch festival. He uses his weapon to demonize and make his longbow more precise and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's witchcraft is a good combat hand, and their ability to use the mace is not weaker than the swordsmanship of the general warrior. Whether it is assault or defense, even if they are besieged by two or three people, they are not confused. In the melee combat, the witch sacrifices constantly move, but they must stand still when they dispel the undead. This is the opportunity for Siegel to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel remembers the archery 精灵 that Elijah teaches him, pushes the bow with his left hand, but don’t hold it; use his right hand to get the arrow, Wait until the last moment before the shot to fill; the arrow needs to be on the same side of the long bow as the bow, so that you can shoot quickly; and aim with your eyes, closing one eye is easy, but it will lose the sense of distance on the battlefield. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is wet and slippery on the battlefield, blood and mud are mixed together. The Orc Witched Sacrifice on a corpse, almost slipped, and the grievances on his opposite side rushed up and raised the long axe to his head. ‘Fast hits’, Siegel thought, ‘This saves me trouble. Unfortunately, his prayers never came into effect. The Orc Witch Festival, although slipping at the foot, ended in balance. He opened his axe to the side of the guard, and he also took the opportunity to raise the giant eye talisman hanging on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and so on is this opportunity, he did not hesitate to bow and shoot. The arrow with magic flies out, full of Siegel’s hopes. But the battlefield did not shift from the will of the human being, and the arrow was blocked by the orcs who had just moved. Although he also shot his forehead and made his life, the witch festival is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that dispels the undead is emanating, and several grievances are screaming in the screams. The Witches turned their heads to see Siegel and saw the second arrow that flew over to him. He slammed down, and the arrow shot by Siegel was rubbing his scalp away. Then the Witch Festival began to pray for divine power, hoping that the Beastmaster God would take away the vision of his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel far from seeing that the witch offering is casting a spell, but can't see what kind of spell is specific. Suddenly he felt his eyes sting, and he immediately guessed that this was a curse of blindness. There was no delay in a time, and Siegel immediately turned around. Although he has vision, but there is no eyeball organization after all, the curse of the witchcraft is just lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
