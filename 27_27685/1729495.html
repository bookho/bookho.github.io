			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A territory under construction means a thousand things, even if Siegel can't sleep, it can't handle all the problems. In order to get the life here as fast as possible, he chose the most direct way - everything is open with gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, he puts most of his energy on the alchemy magical array, and the magical energy flows through him like a tide, washing his body over and over again. Then it is imported into the enchantment. This process is very easy to get tired, but the benefits are also obvious: over time, Siegel has a deeper understanding of magical control and understanding of spells, and began to master the things and practices in the books. Combine experience and purposefully try to transform the magical array of mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he thought of his good friend, Ding Bao, who lives in Ximu Town’s gnome “陂鸭”, remembers that he once asked the dwarf clerk to design it for manufacturing. Magical device for distilled water. Siegel is convinced that his gnome friend is not a caster, and that at most some races have the traits associated with illusion, but it is almost delusional to rely on these driving magic arrays. In this way, what constitutes the structure and principle of the device, is it possible that some aspects can be used in the alchemy array of the mine? The Master felt that this possibility was very great, so he wrote a letter and invited Ding Bao. Turan to settle in Heimchu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter was handed over to the fangs Janis, who also knew the "strange gnome of the grocery store." Siegel asked him to buy some of the goods needed in the territory and inquire about the situation of the boat. He has been worried since he saw the scene of the overturning of the ship through the magic of the shadows. If there is a problem with the Soss, it means that the saying of the passing of the shadow is likely to be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you come across good craftsmen, try to recruit them. But if they are already lords, don't bother." Siegel produces the mine. Part of the gold was handed over to him. "Artisans are preferred. Farmers who can cultivate are also good. If Ding Bao is willing to come, you will ask him what he needs and give him some gold. Be careful along the way."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Janis promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fangs left with the hope of Siegel, and there were two hired knights with him. The news that Heimqiu had the lord gradually spread. Relevant rumors have also begun to be heard in the towns of the Southern Lords League. Unfortunately, Siegel is not born in the wealthy family, even the small aristocratic family is not considered, so it is not optimistic. In addition, he is a mage lord, and is sandwiched between the deep water city and the starry kingdom. Therefore, those southern lords are not optimistic about the development of Siegel, taking a cold and wait-and-see attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude also affects the free knight, so there is no one in the Guards except for Mana. Only some mercenaries came to Heimchu to see what kind of work was done. They are equipped with inlaid leather, shields, swords and drunken eyes. Siegel took out the gold to pay the bill. Instead, let a few people shine and stay to do some chores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag of the nine-claw squid has been flying on the hills, but the prototype of the castle is still far from being seen. Because all carpenters, blacksmiths, masons and even pottery were arranged by the Siegel to the mine. Janet has no complaints about this because she knows that this period is the most difficult. Fortunately, with the speed of the construction of the mine, more and more gold is produced every day. Fitzak has already begun to hire people in the area controlled by the southern lords, so the situation in Heimqi will be getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel will go to the Castle District every morning to find Janet, and she will think about the future picture, eat breakfast together, and then go to the Zebra Mountain Gold Mine. Janet always wants ways to improve the food of the "Lord Lord". And to be able to look at Siegel's smile every day. Meal time is the most joyful time of her day, because at this time it is not the lord, the mage or the nobility sitting opposite her, just Siegel, a man who always gives a thumbs up to her kitchen craft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast today was disturbed. Archer Mana came on horseback and didn't wait for the mount to stand up and jump. It can be seen that the dust on her body, the sweat flowing through the lime soil to form a few mud marks. "There is a large group of dwarf warriors who are coming to the collar. The number is about one hundred." Mana was also polite, grabbed the ale on the table and poured it on, then went on to say: "They are fully armed, a set of body armor It was enough to buy our entire guard. I and the half-orc Dewa brothers wanted to ask them about their intentions. I was attacked before I got too close. I ducked and ran back. The Deva brothers were hammered. Shoot down the horse and faint. It is estimated that this time if you are not captured, you will be killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see the flag of Mora. There are only three gems, red, white and yellow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Siegel Station When he got up, Janet stood up nervously. “Do you need me to bring armor to you?” Janet asked. “You are not stupid enough to fight so many elite dwarf warriors?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the flag of the gem family, I think it is the team sent by Elinte.” Siegel smiled. “I don’t think they will attack me. The Deva brothers lost in their two ugly faces. The dwarves see the half-orcs will be very natural. When they get close, they will of course be attacked. I will redeem them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I and you Go together." Janet said: "Since I won't fight, I won't drag you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never dragged me." I comforted her and said, "Let's go together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves’ team stopped at the “borderline” of Heimqiu and did not cross the past, but Sitting on the ground and taking out the marching dry food began to eat. The Deva brothers were stuffed with rags in their mouths and were thrown aside by the five flowers. They are stunned in their throats, but they can only make a squeaky voice. The dwarves simply ignored them, but they often passed through them with hot sausages and jingling sacs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Janet share a phantom, riding from afar. The magical emblem of a gem family emerges above their heads, followed by Siegel's squid emblem. The leading dwarf put his finger into his mouth and blew his whistle. The soldiers slammed the contents of their hands into their mouths and immediately gathered them. They stood in a neat team, clenching their armor with their fists and making a loud noise. But the dwarves did not pull out the weapons, they knew that it was not the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet first dismissed, and then Siegel jumped. He saw more than a hundred elite dwarf warriors standing in front of themselves in three columns, all wearing elaborate punching body armor. He saw the smile from the eyes of the dwarf, and he was filled with a lot of joy. Siegel narrowed his eyes. Looking carefully, I finally found the clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these dwarves, there is a particularly large and strong guy, standing in the middle of the team. Although he deliberately bowed his head. Let the square helmet cover the face and cheeks, but the prominent big nose and beard still reveal his identity. Siegel opened his arms and ran over, and screamed in his mouth: "Irene! I am so happy! I didn't expect you to come too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The dwarf opened his helmet and laughed loudly. Then hug with Siegel. The mage couldn't hold him up from the ground with all his strength, which made the dwarf look more happy. "Can I come to see you? You are now a lord, I will always come to you as a guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome." Er also jumped and jumped: "I really like it, I don't know what to say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have reached out and patted Siegel’s midfielder. , express your favorite. There are several fingertips that want to try the hardness of the Siegel skull. In order not to let the spell in his head be knocked out, Siegel smiled and hugged them, but remembered to avoid their hard forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel introduced Janet to Dwarf Elinette and said it was his fiancée. Eileen whispered a few times, worried that such a slim wife would have difficulty giving birth to a strong offspring. Janet can't smile. But she changed the dwarf's beard with flowers and made Eileen smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I received your letter from Mora, I was unable to get out of it." Elinette said as she walked: "Until recently I finally took time. You are a lot stronger than when you left the Mullah, I can feel the power in your body. It seems that Leah is right, you are a good seed to learn magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I passed by Mora, I really wanted to go see you." Siegel said: "But the situation was not very good, I The team didn't have much replenishment to stop, so I could only hurry as soon as possible. When I got here, things were even more complicated. My original plan was to wait until the gold mine was built and go to you to build the road. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold Mine?" Irene smiled and said: "You have chosen a good place. The development of the gold mine territory has to save effort. More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must save some strength." Siegel said: "After all, I am still a mage. Learning and research have taken up a lot of my time. With the gold mine, at least I have enough gold coins to buy magical supplies to support my learning expenses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
