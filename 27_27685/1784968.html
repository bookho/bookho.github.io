			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two moat-level magical arrays in the city, all set in the underground layer of the castle. Using the rune pillars left by the dwarves, Siegel first built the elemental rune array to absorb the elemental energy of the castle and the surrounding area, and supply it to the element Runeguard. Here, after the transformation, it can also provide the elemental nutrition needed for body growth for the dragon girl. After <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Siegel continued to expand on the basis of this array, nesting energy focusing lenses. This array can concentrate the energy of the elements in the scope of the action, creating energy disturbances, interfering with the magic spells, especially the structure of the transmission spells. If Siegel is willing, this squad can also have a focus on elemental strikes. For example, when an enemy recites a fireball spell, it accumulates water elemental energy on him, causing elemental conflicts, causing the spell to fail or even killing the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it can also be used as an aid to cast spells to improve spell effects. This is especially effective for elemental summoning spells. When Siegel joins this squad, he can continually summon elemental warriors without considering the effects of excessive spellcasting on the body. Although these elements warriors can't leave the castle, they are more than enough to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two tactics are the basis of the city defense of the city of Mystery and the greatest deterrent against the attack of the elves. Within the scope of this squad, even the underground library of the Masters Union was suppressed. The library's protective magic is more complex and efficient, but the City of Energy's energy-focusing lens uses a more basic force. If the federation's statute is compared to a delicious dish, then the squad of Mire City is the pot and fire for cooking. In the event of a conflict, Siegel is capable of "one pot". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two markets today have quietly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel removed all magic items. Even the defensive staff did not carry it. I only came to the castle outside in plain clothes. He now looks like a mage apprentice: a dark brown robes with a bag of casting materials on one side of the waist. On the other side is the dust of the Sabre Star; a cowhide backpack dangles on the shoulders, and the crystal columns inside collide with each other, making a crisp and pleasant sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel City is now performing the highest alert, the gate is closed, and all residents must stay in the house and not go out. Soldiers were patrolled on the walls and on the road, and enough ammunition and manpower were arranged next to the weapons of the defending city. The cavalry units outside the city are patrolling, several roads in and out of -8-8-8-8, m.£.c≠om are blocked, the caravan must wait in the distance. There is only one end to dare to approach: defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the magical array outside the city, the wizards of the Federation worked for four months in a row and waited quietly. After the completion of the work, it has been protected by the guards, and no one is allowed to approach. In addition to human and half-orc soldiers, there are at least three large elements patrolling every moment to prevent someone from using magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them, including the Master of the Federation, are very curious about what it costs to spend nearly 400,000 gold coins. Although there is a magical array for construction, there are too many blanks on it, and everyone has not tried their best to get an approved answer. They only know that the entire magic array is still doing the collection and handling of elements, just like the enhanced version of the energy focusing lens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for a second energy focusing lens, especially an enhanced version of 400,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t actually calculate the cost of making a crystal column on Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 490,000 gold coins. According to Fazak's words, a palace can be built according to the king's standards. And after all the decorations, all the money is now concentrated on a field about 100 meters. "There should be heavy protection, the lord of the lord." After the completion of the work, he did not mention the empty treasury at least once, at least he would not let Siegel worry too much before the gorge was dug. “The residents of our territory are very simple, but there are some mercenaries outside the castle. They will inevitably have lawlessness, or they should be guarded.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty soldiers kept guarding the new magical array day and night and established a cordon. On this special day, Mana and Zucker went to the scene personally, and the knights who stayed in the city of Mier were aware of the anomalies and gathered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy was behind Siegel, her eyes all fell on his back. From this perspective, Wendy can already confirm that Siegel and "Sos" are one person. Judging from the information she heard, Siegel had a wife, but he actually seduce himself when he was at the hub! Every time he recalled his scene, Wendy's impression continued to deepen. It seemed that every touch and kiss spanned the time and reappeared on her. It is difficult for her to restrain her impulses, but she is saddened by Siegel’s current indifference. On several occasions, she wanted to use spells to tie Siegel, forcing him to answer questions about his feelings. But once she didn't know what she was more afraid of, it was like a knife-like refusal or a hidden heat under the ice. In both cases, she was not prepared to deal with it. On the other hand, she has little confidence in whether she can defeat Siegel in spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy, who was paranoid, did not find a pair of cautious eyes watching her. The female knight, Mana, is wary of the wizards other than Siegel, and naturally will not let go of the woman of the Mage Federation. She believes that Siegel has no emotional and physical needs for this female mage, but only cooperation in magic affairs. But Mana can see that Wendy has an "attempt" for Siegel. The feelings that emerged from the eyes are thick enough to become essential. This is likely to cause trouble for Siegel, and it is the responsibility of the Cavaliers to avoid the trouble of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wick, prepare the bed, aim at the female mage." Mana squinted at the half-orc and whispered to him: "After a while she will Will be close to the Lord of the Lord, have to guard against."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you can rest assured." Mike patted his chest and personally arranged the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel puts a hand on Mana. It was a greeting. Then set foot on the magic array. The cowhide backpack flew up. The nine crystal pillars inside are suspended in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty, don't step into the circle, the energy inside will be harmful to you after a while." Siegel said: "According to the agreement, I will be You explain the function of this magic array, but you can understand it but it has nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still doing business like this, hiding his feelings in the skin Underneath, like a golem, like an element. But Wendy is sure that there is a person hiding in it, a passionate person. Come to the female mage. This is a very challenging game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sigger Master, I am ready, you can begin to unravel the mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This array is improved from the elemental surge of the elves. I haven't officially named it. In addition to the magical knowledge of the elves, there is the mana pool technology of the federation, the runes of the dwarves, The illusion of the gnome and the plasma rune of the sin. So even though you have made most of the structure of the squad, you can't see its true effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you all?" Wendy's heart beats badly. In the things of Siegel, any one needs to be studied for a long time, and some can be used without understanding. Whether or not this array can achieve the desired goal, as long as it can work, it means that Siegel can integrate all the knowledge he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves have come up with a way to use the magic array to split the material into basic elements, thereby pushing up the concentration of elements in the environment to achieve devastating waves. The conditions of the rush. But I think it is too wasteful to simply use this technology as a war, so I think of ways to improve." Siegel, while controlling the crystal pillar stone and the magic array, connected to Wendy: "Joint There are some spells recorded in the magic book of the meeting. I combine them to guide the elements, get rid of the violent, make them slow and gentle. I still have a lot of experience in summoning and using elemental creatures. It is not difficult. The most difficult part of the entire array is to make the process of cracking controllable, which requires the mana pool and the gnome of the gnome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King The biggest advantage of Alexander in the city of Mire is this: Siegel can learn from him nearby. In addition to the time to escape the Elven Saint, the sorcerer who became the lich stayed in the castle underground, watching the elemental array and the energy focusing lens daily. He exchanged the knowledge of the energy focusing lens with Siegel using the information of the Federation's mana pool, thus filling the lack of the Master's lord design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mana pool is able to strip the structure and energy of the spell and store them separately. This ability to strip is well suited to interrupt and control the speed of the surge array. The gnome's illusion can be used as the best means of monitoring, allowing the entire array to adjust itself, and to allow a single-running elemental surge array to cycle and repeat the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves use their elemental surge to create an invincible tsunami, and Siegel turns it into a constantly flowing river. When the whole process is controllable, the dwarf runes are used to ensure the integrity of the magic matrix, and the consumption of the matrix material is concentrated on a single substance. The elemental rune array needs to be replenished with mercury, while the new array requires a cast material powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last part of the squad is the technique of the ectopic plane, in which I added the elemental energy transformation and the ability of the sorcerer." Erdao: "All these things are combined and they serve only one purpose: to provide unlimited energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" Wendy Road : "No one can have unlimited energy, which is not in accordance with the principle of exchange!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
