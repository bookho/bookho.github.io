			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the west side of the Walled Mountain Range," Siegel's staff waved and showed them this magnificent land. WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad and empty plain is spread out at the foot of the mountain and spreads to the end of the sky. The growing grass covers every inch of land that is covered by the vision. As the wind sways gently, it is like a vast ocean. Only the place where the west sky is connected with the grass sea, there are some gray peaks in the faint direction. In other directions, you can stretch your eyes, either green or blue, and clearly separate the sky and the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point of the outpost was built on the side of the tunnel entrance, occupying the advantage of the highlands. The large grey stone and the red lacquered steel bar build a tall wall, and the three bastions protrude from the main body, guarding the three most important directions. The flag of Moore, which is on the highest tower of the castle, has been collected, and now it is Siegel’s nine-claw squid flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore took his knights to wait for the early exit, and more than forty armed men were placed in three teams, holding their respective flags. Most of the people here are promoted by mercenaries and barbarians. Many of their flags are new, and there is no historical accumulation from above. Some people use their favorite weapons or sky stars as a symbol, and they seem to be decent, but some people are not so particular. Siegel glanced at him and saw a roast chicken and two roast leg of lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who greeted did not ride horses, and Sigel and his party left the scorpion in the tunnel. He strode up and grabbed Moore, who was kneeling on the ground, and hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, you have become stronger!" Siegel patted his shoulder and said: "There is more meat here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point of the outpost is much more difficult than the secret city. I want to rely on the initial less than 20 knights to build a fortress, both to test intelligence and to test patience. Although it is dangerous to deal with large groups of animals, it is not too difficult to master the skills. The most troublesome thing is to face the various barbarian tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plateau barbarians are better, they believe in the sun god - in fact, the incarnation of the god of the morning sun on the side of the city wall mountain - so more straightforward and kind. As long as you keep the same straightforward, you can be friends with them with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowland barbarian at the foot of the mountain is more barbaric and awkward. Without integrity is only the most inconspicuous of their many abuses. After many failures, Moore found that only the power of the sword could talk to them. Then it opened a frequent battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camps can be easily built around water sources, herds and shelter points. The starting outposts continue to fight with some tribes and harvest the spoils with the rules of barbarians and expand scale. Just like Siegel. Moore does not care about race, culture and origin. As long as he can serve the starting point outright with integrity and obedience, he will treat everyone equally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Lord, the starting point of the outpost is waiting for you to send."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" OK, introduce me These warriors behind you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many starting point outposts are the first to see Siegel. Even the first time I saw a mage. They have been listening to Moore telling his various stories, especially the two "one-day wars". In their imagination, Siegel should be a powerful man, like a giant, and now he is disappointed after seeing a real person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expression is clearly written on the face, making Moore feel awkward. But Siegel didn't mind, and everyone saw two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the official meeting, Siegel said: "Mor, let them go to the outpost to settle down, you and I go to see your grandfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mol face has a hard color. A strong fangs, quietly said to Siegel: "Adult, if my grandfather hit me, you can stop. My men have some straight-minded barbarians, I saved their lives, so the loyalty is very Seeing someone hit me, maybe it will be violent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, they won't see you." Siegel used one Referring to the team, Moore saw Lille, a halfling who was hiding in the middle of the human leg. He was wiping the tears of excitement with a handkerchief. It still seems to be immersed in the excitement of seeing the commander again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am for your good." Lille replied very wrongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stopped Moore and took him to Fazak: "There is something to say clearly in a moment. You are safe here, we will Feel more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak is looking at the distant scenery with a telescope until Sigel coughs back. He saw Moore, snorted and said: "Is it very free here? Is it said that I am getting married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohr shook his head Wave your hand. Quickly said: "Impossible, impossible, impossible to achieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the name Nata is made up?" Fazak narrowed his eyes. Look carefully at Moore: "If you think about it, if you want to lie in front of me, it is best to brew your emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am "Don?" Moore scratched his head. "Where do you say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nata was born in a lowland barbarian tribe, and it is said that she thundered when she was born. Another star fell, which prompted her to gain life. At the beginning she was no different from her peers, and her strength continued to grow until she became a powerful warrior in the Horde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen her grab the yak's horn with one hand and use it as a sack on the floor."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should she do this? Do you exercise your strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohr shook his head, and some embarrassed said: "I used to Tell her that the beef is knocking more and more, and the meat is cut off. The meat quality will be delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Fitzak look at each other, in my heart Basically understand that this Nata and Moore must have a relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is now the first warrior of the bull rhinoceros, or the eldest daughter of the chieftain, so she actually speaks like the chieftain. According to the tribal tradition, she is very It’s almost time to join the recruiting club for the first time. The strongest man who can beat her can take her home.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t you go?” Fazak asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless to go, I can’t beat her at all.” Moore spread his hand, a helpless look: "The result of her hard hit is the weapon." Broken, the armor is broken, she only needs a few rounds to win, and she said that she will never stop in the battle, I have no hope of going."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fazak has been observing Moore’s look and then beckoning him. "What?" Moore just got together and was slap by Fazak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you kidnapped people?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can also be seen Come out?" Moore had a mouth and knew that he was finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that this move is not a must." Siegel pulled Fazak and said, "Tell me about this bull rhinoceros. It's a Is it a terrible tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Moore leaned in the direction of Siegel, avoiding the range of his grandfather's wingspan. “The Niu Rhino tribe was closely related to the dwarfs. It was able to buy reasonable prices from the top of the Mora. It has been developing very well. It has more than 1,500 people. It is a relatively large tribe. Their tribal leader is called Dio is also the father of Nata."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dio? Siegel’s eyes are not so smart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do they believe in, can they communicate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They believe in the god of the wilderness, too It is called a god. It is probably the same as the elf Druid.” Moore said with confidence: “Most people have the same lingua franca, but the dwarf language is better, and the communication is mainly based on dwarf language.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you can rest assured to prepare, I will give you a way to get Nata back." Siegel said: "Especially you have a relationship If you are pregnant, can't you let your family's blood flow out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
