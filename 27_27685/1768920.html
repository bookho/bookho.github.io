			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell that affects thinking is the most dangerous of all spells. If a person can't have a free will, what is the difference between a puppet and a marionette? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy is getting closer to the full lips, the eyes are slightly shaking with a pair of closed eyes. She is afraid, not because of passion, but because she is still deeply concerned, she still retains the final fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel squeezes a thin powder from the spell material pack and recites the spell. Wendy snorted and opened her eyes. She saw that this was the mantra of the human body, and asked in confusion: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too close. Said Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty did not guard against the spell, but extended his milky arm and untied the hair band behind his head. Long hair undulating, like a wave of water on the beach, spread over the full body. She turned to Siegel with the pair of pale blue eyes, flashing a lively, enthusiastic glow: "Do you think your spell can stop me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel reveals a shallow, naughty smile that gives Wendy the feeling of being an intimate game. He raised his hand and the man's spell was shrouded in Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the guards emerged, the effect of the body was neutralized, and the layer of all the protections on Wendy disappeared. Wendy smiled and said to Siegel: "I still have a lot of protective spells, and I can continue to cast spells. I will get closer and get what I want!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel put his lips to Wendy's ear, and the heat of breathing made her body itchy. He said lightly and slowly: "I don't believe in evil, Ms. Protector, I have to try if I can make you meet with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter two People started the "game." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel has purposefully begun the act of disarming and neutralizing Wendy’s protective spells, both to be clean and neat. Passion can make people forget, Wendy is now in this state. She felt the power of passion in her body that she had never felt before. This power was so powerful that the protective spells were pale and powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans usually cover their bodies with clothes to resist the environment and the eyes of others. Wendy uses layer-by-layer protection spells and constructs his own clothes with deep wariness. The false happiness brought by the magic tower and the illusion of passion that Siegel deliberately guided, stripped the outermost guards, and protected the spells from isolation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel uses the pace of the elves. Flashing in a small space, while limiting the movements of Wendy's spell, while constantly casting spells, the effect of her spells is lifted. He summoned the elements of water and tried to control Wendy's limbs. However, the female mage dispels the elements. And wet the clothes with water. Siegel laughed, his eyes wide open, and Wendy thought a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hate the ghost!" She also found the effect of her own tulle clothes after being wet, so she smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁 This opportunity, Siegel quietly lifted her evasive detection enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game between the two was further upgraded, and Wendy tried to control Siegel’s lips and blocked his possibility of chanting a spell. Siegel turned to the beginning, and the fiery feeling swam between the female mage's neck, letting her laugh. She instinctively narrowed her neck and looked at Siegel with a sly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way you will fail." Siegel removed a protective spell. And smiled and said: "I will strip you soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will not be so easy." Wendy pouted, again A circle of protective spells rose in her body. In order to win the victory with the "lover", she used the cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two levels of trigger protection, it really has a doorway. Siegel’s mouth trembled and accepted the challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned the flame as if delaying Wendy’s progress, but actually observing the effect of the element on her. The female wizard walked straight into the flame, her hair emitting a charred smell, but essentially no damage. Siegel saw the reaction of protective magic, waving his hand to lower the temperature of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frowned and seemed to be moving in a sober direction. A pair of rough hands touched it at this moment. In an instant, she once again fell into obsession. Wendy summoned the breeze, blowing away the clouds, and the state of the gas element running around her was also known by Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pulled Wendy’s shoulder and dropped her to the ground. The back is a cold stone floor, but the front is a hot warmth. A spell without active consciousness control is like a lamb to be slaughtered, and a layer of protective enchantment that collapses like a melting ice in the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy is excited to want to tremble. But she found that she could not breathe. She was torn and pulled by the burning flame in her body, her body had become uncontrolled, and all her strength was away from her. She had nothing. The Magic Tower constantly hints at her. "It's also very good. It's good to let the baggage get the peace and peace of mind." At this time, she felt that there was support in the body. Even without protective spells, she still had security, fullness and fullness. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel observes the changes in her eyes and then discovers the last trace of danger. Wendy didn't know where to come from, and suddenly turned up and sat down, pressing Siegel underneath. Her voice trembled with excitement, and the skin of her body was flushed. Her last will is to take the initiative, regardless of the circumstances to take the initiative. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Siegel removed the protective spells layer by layer and captured Wendy’s body and mind, she still had to be active. The last resort of the original protector was this - Siegel understood her thoughts. No matter what the circumstances, as long as the initiative is in your own hands, then all spells will eventually be cracked - she will re-apply her own spell shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Wendy’s hands clasped Siegel’s wrists and slowly lowered his head. As long as Siegel had a curse, she would cover his lips. Siegel blinked and motioned Wendy to get closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage is not suspected of having him, ready to enjoy his own meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart, I’m sorry, Siegel is in a blink of an eye. The green plasma lines flow through the pale bones, and the black eyelids exude a heart-rending red glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge contrast is beyond Wendy’s psychological endurance. From the moment of the most passionate moments into the greatest fear of life, the female wizard can not respond. She twitched and turned her eyes and fainted on Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light that was supposed to rise also disappeared, and she is now completely exposed to Siegel's spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracted, Siegel gently placed her side on the bed. This is the only chance. Neither will it trigger any alarms nor be blocked by spells, a protective mage who has lost protection against spells (I deliberately:)). Siegel chanted the spell and connected his thoughts to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a coma. Wendy is still wary, but let Siegel come to protection. She has accepted this male mage deep inside, and everything is open to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beach of consciousness, the mood is the sea, and every piece of memory is the shell on the beach. The most secret treasures of peace are hidden in the deep sea. Protected by complex and profound emotions. When the tide starts and falls, the memory shells on the beach are constantly polished. Some will become more and more shining in the passage of time, and some will disappear and become ordinary sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wanders on Wendy's beach, the most embarrassing of which is a newly formed diamond. Siegel can see his figure from the cross section of the diamond. He is full of body, holding Wendy in his arms, and the face of the female mage is filled with happiness and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel gently stroked the diamond and apologized to Wendy. "You know, you are a good girl, a beautiful diamond." Siegel said: "I am so impressed in your heart. I feel very honored. But you may not know, it all. It’s the effect of a spell.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t want to use Knox’s danger as an excuse, deception and exploitation are caused by me, and magic is just a means.” Siegel Holding the diamond, trying to take it off Wendy's memory. In the mind of the female mage, there were waves of the sky, the storm whistling, and the lightning flashed. Siegel loosened his hand, the diamond swayed and fell to the beach, but the surrounding area was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
