			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around the hills, you can see that there are many bonfires along the river, dotted with tents that have been hurriedly set up by hides and sheepskins. There are several shacks that are backed by hills, surrounded by rocks, covered with dry pine branches and fur, and decorated with beast's teeth and colorful stones. Siegel saw several orcs in the fire beating the pointed end of the long wooden spear, while throwing a spear to test the hand; two young men wearing fur hit each other with sticks, skipping the bonfire and chasing each other, calling in the mouth Constantly; a half-orc of a big breast sits in a circle, giving the bow and feathers. At the beginning, Siegel thought that there was no sentinel here, but suddenly stood up from the snow behind him, a few small orcs, cloaks made of moss and branches, covered with new snow, perfectly integrated with the environment. . These people have very simple bows in their hands, and there are a few sharpened wood spears on their waists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wick!" The Orc shouted and untied the buckskin pocket behind him and threw it on the floor. Most of the deer rolled out of their pockets, and naturally there were women coming up to clean up. Siegel thought that he would see the scene of welcoming his compatriots, but he only saw tension and alienation from the eyes of these villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gram half-orc does not care, or pretends to be a careless expression, waving the Master to keep up and take him through the camp. A few children who were not afraid of being born ran past Siege, looked at Siegel curiously and pointed at his appearance. However, in Siegel's view, the characteristics of these children belonging to the orcs are more obvious than the older residents here, and apparently the result of constant marriage. Orcs grow faster than humans, and their characteristics can be passed on to future generations as quickly as possible. When the part that belongs to human beings is not yet mature, the blood of the orcs can begin to continue. Therefore, the intermarriage between the half-orcs, as the age of men and women is reduced, the characteristics of the orcs will appear more from the offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two came to the camp farthest from the river, where there was an open space surrounded by fallen pine trees, and a tattered tent in the middle. It can be seen that here was a big snow here, and the tent was crushed by snow. In addition to the tent, you can also see the chain of hyenas and several clay pots. The Musk half-orc came here and began to pick up the tent without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel wants to take the handle, but is pushed away by Mike. The Orc does not use any tools, just use his own hands to dig the snow, re-erect the tent's bracket, tie the rag, and then start cleaning up the original stuff. The half-orcs around did not help, they were still busy. The venison was separated in the village, and each family got a piece of palm size. They also don't come to Zucker's thanks, and they take their food and go home to barbecue with fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the habit of the northern half-orcs? Siegel glared at the short beard on his chin and thought about it while looking around. It would be unreasonable to form a tribe to do if it does not help each other. Moreover, the Orc Junke is an excellent wild survivor from the performance along the way, and this village does not see any crops. The status of members with hunting skills should be relatively high. What is wrong with everything? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gram half-orc gathered the tent and walked in. Segal looked down and found a fist-sized cloth bag in front of him, hitting his forehead on the ground every time. He also took the ice dagger and placed it next to the cloth bag, just like the pastor offering a sacrifice, very religious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Zucker climbed out again, closed the door of the tent and pressed it with snow to prevent it from being blown away by the wind. He took Siegel to the front of the house that was backed by hills and surrounded by rocks. Three pregnant women are grilling a few skewers of meat with a brazier at the door, which seems to be squirrels and certain birds. When they saw Jack, they picked up the animal's skin curtain and let the passage open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel followed the half-orc and entered the middle-aged human being. He is short and fat, about forty years old, and his eyes are very smart. A necklace made of a squirrel skull is worn around the neck without any sense of deterrence. His thick arm is covered with a horn ring engraved with runes, and the body is covered with thick fur for warmth, and a heavy black ring armor is placed outside. He was sitting on a wooden stool next to the brazier, eating a string of grilled squirrels, and the hot oil stayed behind his mouth and broke into the gray-black goat. He smirked cheerfully as he ate, revealing a yellow tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Mike came in, first stunned and then continued to laugh. "Where is this undead disaster star, what is the evil now?" When Siegel came in, he smiled even more happily: "Who is this? Your spoils? Last time it was unfamiliar." The fur wolf, this time directly slammed the individual back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say that this person is a witch festival or a god of reproduction? We are missing a witch festival. Should we entertain it, aren't we? Come and eat some kebabs. From the volcano, you are almost cooked." The man who barbecued suddenly said. In the stunned expression of Siegel, he stood up. "I am Lin Ke - half palm, the boss here, as you see is a personal class. Who are you, where did you come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Why do you say that I am a witch offering?” Siegel frowned. In the half-orc society, the witch sacrifice is equivalent to the human pastor, so he denied: "I am not a witch festival, but a mage, I am called Siegel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Siegel, welcome you to my tribe. You are brought back by the unlucky one. If it is not a witch festival, you will suffer. Remember the suede he brought back last time. The wolf, actually untied the chain and stole the chicken in the village, was beaten hard, and now fled into the wilderness. You won’t be like this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, never." Siegel shook his head and he decided to take back the right to speak. "Where is this village, where is the nearest orc town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The village is on the snowfield, and this snowfield has only one northern name, called the tears. Wasteland. Law...Mage Siegel, there is no big town around the orcs, or we have long joined the army to the warmth. And you can't see the beauty of this being in the orcs?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a human face." Siegel nodded. The orcs worship the strong, but think that all the half-orcs and humans are weak and disabled, and will not care about their life and death. Especially the guy who looks to humans, even if he is a half-orc, will be discriminated against. "There will be no good endings in the orcs. But are you really humans, not half-orcs with lighter bloodlines?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I not only have humans Faces, my whole body is made up of human parts, including the parts in the pants!" Lin Ke was insulted and almost untied to confirm the innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, I don't want to see what kind of body, you still wear clothes." Siegel shakes his hand, and the half-orc also agrees. "I want to ask you, do you know how to get to the road south of the Walled Mountain Range?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Walled Mountain Range." Lin Ke 砸 砸 ,, Then he said: "I don't know how long you have come to the north side of the mountain. Here, we call it the sheepfold mountain range, not the city wall mountain. All human beings are orphaned sheep. After a while, they will cut it. Let the lamb shave the wool. And young people, don't think about going back to the south, now all the roads are not open. The orcs are marching, don't you want to crash into it? Wait until the end of the war, maybe there is a safe road."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orcs are already mobilizing their troops? How many are in which direction they are going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;林The branch glanced at Siegel with a squint and said: "Do you really think of me as a bachelor with a question? If you can't manage your mouth, ask some questions and you will get bored. Although there are no orcs in the village, you still have to be careful to make a mistake."<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike! Mike." The Orc stepped forward and stopped in front of Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I just verbally said two words, I wouldn’t really think about him." Lin Ke sat back in his chair and clapped his hands. The pregnant woman with a big belly outside came in, put down the kebab on her hand, and then took out two skin bags and gave it to Siegel and Linke. There was nothing in front of Mike, but he didn't care. Since entering the village, he neither eats nor drinks, only shares things, but does not take anything. When Siegel was thirsty, he opened the skin. The liquid inside was still warm, and he carefully smelled it, but couldn't tell what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink, these are safe snow, put some spruce leaves to cook." Lin Ke first drank a big mouth, then comfortable Take a breath. “Although it’s not real tea, it’s already the best thing without wine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and a spruce tea, It was found that there was a bitter taste on the surface of the drink, but there was a hint of sweetness in the depths. Obviously, the body liked the ingredients inside. This reminded him of another drink he had encountered before, so he asked: "Do you know the gold syrup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linco frowned He whispered, "Why are you mentioning the evil things? We have no addicted half-orcs here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
