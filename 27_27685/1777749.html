			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at some of the arrogant Alexander, and did not fight one thing: "You are going to die, what are you still hesitating?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion looked frustrated and awkward. He dangled the bottle of the enchant potion and said, "Who is this for you? Faranis?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the bachelor of Faranas who gave it to me before he died. He said that he was countered by fate, even if he became a lich, he could not escape, so this The potion is useless. Then this thing has been in my hands until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siegel, do you say that Ranis is foreseen today? "What?" He sighed and shook his head. "I really don't understand the power of the prophet, but I fortunately didn't become a mysterious prophet. It was just a generalist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly drink." Siegel said: "You want William to rebuild the Masters Federation, it is better to pick it up." It is not always possible to find him. Without the sergeant sitting in the town, do you think it will take a long time for the Three Peaks Tower to return to normal? Is there no one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After becoming a dead spirit..." The lion seemed to think of something, smiled mockingly, and then smacked the lich at the hand and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I began to feel the advent of death, the body has ample negative energy." Alexander touched his chest, the heart is no longer beating, breathing It also gradually ends, and the eyes that have lost their blood supply can't tell the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles are stiff, numb and dull, and the touch disappears for a while. Just as Siegel became a scepter, taste and smell were lost with the death of flesh and blood. Lion King Alexander explained the process in detail while "dead", just like teaching students. He told Siegel all the problems that might have occurred in his character, thoughts and ideas after he became a dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he waved, and Siegel’s defensive staff flew into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a lich, you have to have a life-threatening sacred fire. As long as the soul is not lost, the lich will not die. Even if the body is broken, you can reshape the body." He said to Siegel: "You gave me this bottle of medicine, knowing that I became a lich. I also understand the danger of the undead. I know the destruction of my spell ability." Sex, so I decided to take the defensive staff as a life and give it to you. If I harm the world, harm the wizards, destroy the development of magic, you will destroy me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Siegel was hesitant. He understands that this is Alexander's trust. But at the same time it is also a hot potato. This fate will become the target of all kinds of prophetic spells, and all those who are determined to destroy the undead will come to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I think about it, Siegel has an idea. As long as the staff is placed in the space of the scorpion, it is not afraid of any detective spell effect. In theory, even Alexander himself cannot sense it. Using this method can guarantee the safety of Siegel. At least those who want to be fatal, including Alexander who changed his mind, will not die at Siegel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you want to use it." Siegel said: "After becoming a fate, will the staff always emit evil spirits? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will cover the light." The lion touched the defensive staff with both hands, then lay down and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of standing and watching other people’s death made Siegel feel embarrassed, so he came to the cemetery. Most of the names on the tombstones are not known to him, and they are not distinguishable from the old members of the Masters Federation and the Knox Association. In the memory of the Lion King, many of the former members of the Federation eventually became admirers of the Casper Master, and enthusiastically contributed to the cause of the "United Nations Consolidation of the New World." So even Alexander did not know that these people were ultimately considered to be members of the Federation. So it did not reflect this on the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a tombstone, Siegel knows who he is: Caspar Harris, ** division, federation ruler, enchantment specialization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life is much richer than these few words, but after death, only this sentence is with him. Siegel saw the tombstone, and there was an unreal feeling in it: Did the Knox Association fail like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the tsunami and the storm turned into a sunny, cloudless sunny day, and his sea boat sailed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looks at his own hand and makes it hard to punch. Until the palm of the hand has a feeling of pain. Victory should bring a feeling of joy, but he has no such feeling at all. In his heart, he always does not believe what he sees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living person sat down and took out a bag of red wine and poured it on the grave of the deceased. Siegel didn't know Kasper's faith and couldn't pray for him. A victory that is not obtained by hand is like a bubble. It looks gorgeous in the sun, but it seems to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knox Commonwealth has also been hit in history, being "cleared" by the Masters Association, and then reborn again. It is difficult to guarantee that such a thing will not happen for the second time. And in addition to the deep water city, there are hubs, brook towns and macabu 哒, these places have red spires, there are members of the Knox Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf Idis had told Siegel that the Masters Association had begun to eliminate the Commonwealth and to remove the Pioneer of this Nethers. However, it is not known when the work can be done completely. As for whether it can be completely eradicated... Siegel thinks and can't believe too much of the power of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the tombstone of Casper’s teacher and said goodbye to him in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep behind him, and it turned out to be Alexander who had already stood up again. His eyes lost their looks, but there was a golden yellow flame burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am still not very comfortable with the current state." The lion's voice became hoarse and heavy, with a strong echo. "It turned out that it relied on muscle action. Now the muscles are all cumbersome and hinder the movement of the bones. I feel like I am stuck in a swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel Did not answer, just look at the defensive staff in the hands of the Lion King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander looked down and snorted and threw the staff over. "You can rest assured that I will not regret it for a while. Once I regret it, you know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the staff, there are still The evil spirits are constantly being released. Did Alexander forget the promise just made? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care what spells I use now, I have to be evil, so you're afraid to wait." Alexander continued to use his weird voice: "I have to think One way to change this state, otherwise you can't see anyone. Change the hat, defensive detection ring, body anti-corrosion talisman and dispel the resistance belt. Should this be enough at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel shrugged his shoulders: "How do I know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are currently the smartest person in the entire federation." Siegel couldn't hear from the tone that this sentence is compliment or ridicule, but he can only listen patiently. "You can stand on the ruins of the Three Peaks Tower without any damage, and your opponents - whether it is the Elf or Knox - all fall down, then you are the smartest. You tell me. Should How to rebuild the federation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Faranes once said that the most important thing for the federation is the concept of knowledge and tolerance, as long as the two are not discarded, The Federation will be revived. Lord Alexander, I suggest not to establish the sign of the Federation for the time being. You should not show up, lest the hidden enemies - such as the remnants of the Knox Association - bring trouble. First apprentice from the Master The training institutions started and developed step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Deepwater or Heim?" Alexander looked sideways at Siegel, his The eyelids hang down and cover one side of the eye, making it look terrible. He pushed his eyelids up again and rubbed it hard, which made him look pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will temporarily disappear for a while until I get the body, then I will go to William. The Three Peaks Tower is handed over to you. Siegel. If I No, will you all evacuate it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel nodded: "I did have this plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King shook his head and smiled bizarrely: "If I were you, I would not do this. The elves will come back again, they will not let go of the storage of the Three Peaks Tower, but with you. The ability to leave without the things here. Especially don't forget, the Masters Association may come here, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
