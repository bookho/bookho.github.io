			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dawn of the sky, the faint light cast by the morning sun on the Shield River drifted with the water. The boat sailed past it, crushed it into fish scales, and gathered again after the ship passed. This kind of beauty is suitable for distraction, but from three days ago, Sir Grenner placed the elves here, giving them tents and food, and sending troops to "protect". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering of four hundred elves brings a lot of trouble. Their habits and humans are very different, so that the fat Sir Grenner started to have a headache on the first day. He immediately found the sergeant Siegel, hoping to get help and support. The young lord smiled and sent the half-orcs of Zangke and Zhishi Village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiness of life is produced by comparison and difference. Compared to the rude and rudeness of the Orcs, the gentle and generous Sir Grenner is easier to get along with. They suddenly feel that the current life can still be accepted, at least there is a place to live, something to eat, and it is in the natural environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc said that there was a group of human captives in Heim, who were caught and thrown into the pit to work hard. Although the elf’s stubborn thought that he is only a “guest army”, no one is a fool, who is not worried about the miners’ end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will arrange a troupe to perform for you, as long as you don't leave this area." Sir Grenner is always sweating. He is determined to play the role of "good old man". "Don't provoke the half-orc, he has only muscles and no ceremonies. For the command of the lord, he has always been meticulously executed. He will never be merciful to the elves who do not listen to persuasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current state does not satisfy the elf, but it is enough to guarantee life. Siegel allows the Elf Forest to send people to view the living conditions of these elves at any time, or to "subscribe people", as long as the total number of people remains the same. Siegel also has plans to separate the four hundred elves and place them in three to four camps. Play a role of mutual restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the generals support this approach, because everyone knows very well that these hostages are actually a guarantee of peace. The specific work was all handed over to Mana. Siegel followed the master of Lia to the Elven Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people ride on the horse and walk side by side. Beside him is the elf's army. The entire army maintains a repressed silence, moving forward in the northeast almost without stopping every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way they passed through a number of deserted villages where residents fled their homes as early as the elves arrived, or hid in the wilderness, or in the castle of the lord . The hub and its affiliated outer city are the most populous places, and are still under the siege of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmland that no one cares about is already turning into a field, but it can still see the structure of the ridge. The originally erected scarecrow was crushed in the heavy snow in winter and is now in the weeds. It became the nest of the grouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves planted trees on the hillside, with pine, eucalyptus and hawthorn, and they are growing very well. There are many birds that settle down on these trees and share the joy of nature. Siegel stopped by a jujube tree for a while, and saw a messy footprint under the tree, looking like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The druid's magic is amazing, it can make the jujube so fast." Siegel said to the master of Lia: "If used in farmland "Isn't it a person who can support a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the population surge, it will consume more things." Lia replied: "We found that humans have a trend Two thousand years ago, two acres of land can support a person, but with the development of human beings and the increase in the number of people, now five acres of land are not necessarily able to feed a person. It seems that as time goes by, human waste is better than The production capacity will increase even faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really didn't think about it." Siegel said: "But even if this is true, we also I will come up with a solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For human innovation and development capabilities. We never underestimate, but don't know when humans come up with ways to come. "We are still there," said Leah. "This is my father's words. He also uses you as an example to illustrate humanity. Potential. Druids do not want to kill human beings, just want to create a natural paradise that can maintain the balance of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Druid The idea is good, but the location is not right.” Siegel shook his head gently and said: “Like I experimented with magic, I never did it in a densely populated place. The elves want to realize their ideas. Why are you looking for it? An area without people's smoke? The New World is vast and there is a world beyond the walls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel sighed, but did not say anything. Although the elves have tried their best to reproduce the ancient trees of war. But there is no mental preparation for the war. According to the culture of the elves, they are recreating the power of nature and improving the environment and ecology of the New World, but for humans this is a contest between life and death. The elf just drove humans and did not raise the butcher knife. The ideal is beautiful, the reality is cruel, because the war can never be beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With four hundred elves as hostages, Heim’s collar finally ushered in the long-awaited peace. According to the previous layout of Siegel, it is only the first step to recover the original castle. He wants to build a giant territory connecting the walled mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost Fog Swamp was originally a land of nowhere, where the banner of Heim’s collar was inserted, where the land belongs to Siegel. The cavalry rushed all the way and continued to sneak into the sea before stopping. They stepped on a straight line with horseshoes, and then there were workers who followed closely and began to build roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road means the power to collect taxes, which is the most basic and core part of the power of the lord. Along the road, build a simple house, then burn out the fields and sow the seeds. I haven’t been able to take care of it this year, but I only need to grow my crops. This is the farmland that Heim is leading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering Heim’s leadership means peace, land can be cultivated, and work can earn money. This news spread throughout the South with the caravan, attracting many people all the way to the north, came to Heim to seek life. Those who are hiding in the wilderness of the wilderness have also left the refuge in difficult conditions and become the population of Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Southern Lords Alliance heard the news, many of the lords spewed out an old blood. They are still entangled with the elves, a castle and a castle. Drey Uther is negotiating with the elves, thinking that he can bring peace to the South first, but he did not expect this honor to be preempted by Siegel. The old man laughed and broke three cups. Then he continued to talk with the elves in a spirited manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Heim’s precedent, I believe that negotiations will be much easier. Dray conceived very well, but he is not Siegel after all. Not a strong mage lord, and not negotiating with him. The arrogance of the elf and the rituals that refused to be thousands of miles away made him grievous. I want to give up a few times, and I won the battle on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he also understands that if his strength continues to be consumed, the gap with Heim will widen. Therefore, he can only suppress the emotions again and again, and continue to work with the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people have different annoyances, and Siegel is not too easy. He followed the elf's army to Islos, and re-entered the country protected by the rune trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being attacked by a black man, it became apparently heavily guarded. The mysterious magical energy is everywhere. As a guest, Siegel wears the silver moon badge of the temple of the previous month, but still feels tremendous pressure. The whole elf forest begins to be heavily guarded and deeply rejected by outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's army went to the forest, and then disappeared without a trace, as if it had never existed - they arrived home. Elf Lia and Siegel all the way, have been under the holy tree. They dismounted here and walked to the Druid jungle on foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the pressure on the Elven Forest is greater, and Siegel is as burden-bearing. Difficult walking on the land. He was sweating all over his body, his hands and feet were sore, and he did not fall down by the support of the defensive staff. He used the vision to observe the surroundings. It is found here that there is a spell enchantment after the combination of Elemental Magic and Holy Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Luna badge hanging on his chest is shining brightly, attracting the surrounding forces to surrender to Siegel. The mage lord reached out and pulled the badge down and threw it on the ground, which made it feel a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like my badge so much?" With the sound of the rustling leaves, an elf man in a silver robe walked out. His pale blond hair is beautiful and looks strong and strong. The golden belt is decorated with a long sword. Seven different colored stones are inlaid on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Man!" Leah hurried down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the "Holy Man" with his spirit and found that his whole body was composed of powerful power. The structure is firm and indestructible. I saw him wave his hand and the pressure from the Elven Forest receded. Siegel is free to act freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
