			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hub of the city is the center of this human gathering place, one of the first castles built after the discovery of the New World. The pioneering spirit of Count Statt, with his knights, came across the sea and smashed the thorns, building a hub in this place that was originally a wasteland. The Statt family plans to draw river water, open up good fields, dig mines in the mountains, and operate them into a hundred-base industry, which will be passed on to future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wildness and innocence of the New World exceeds the count’s expectations, and there are too many hidden dangers. When the sudden illness claimed the life of the Earl in its prime, the hub was only repaired the inner city, and the fertile land was only half opened. Only the mine and the river were successfully completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl died, his knight left the main fort, and went to the surrounding fiefdom to run his own industry. Although they still owe allegiance to the Earl's successors, the cohesiveness is not as good as before. The construction of the hub was basically stagnant. As a result, two hundred years later, the Earl of the Count was degraded to the Viscount. The castle still has only the inner city and half of the outer wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But outside the hub, there are several villages that protect the castle in the central part of the city like a sentry post. The residents living here are independent, they pay more attention to their own affairs and ignore the outside world. The things that happen in the hub and surrounding villages are all of them. They are working hard, they will not leave this land easily, and they will not take risks everywhere. According to the locals, "That is a fate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Due to its special location, it also has a good waterway and river trade terminal. Hubburg is often able to meet foreign travelers here. They brought news from afar, especially the stories of the Old World. Residents of Hubburg warmly welcome travellers from these countries to tell history or legends and cheer them up. However, the people of Hubburg never interacted with these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the manager of the hub is the Visa Kira-Start, a short man in his forties, who is listening to Novo Town and The messengers of Dongteng Town were so arguing over the border disputes of farmland. At this time, his attendant reported that a jazz asked for an important message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell him to come in." Visa Kira beckoned and then said to others: "I will send my office to investigate the situation on the border." The parties must not have any action until they reach a conclusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill and Leah entered the chamber and saw the Viscount sitting on two steps In the big chair, the others stood under the steps on the left and right sides. They looked up and down the two people from the corner of their eyes and judged the identity of a person from gait, costume and look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be Sir Bill, I think there will be someone who will become the messenger jazz." Visa Kira held his chin and said with interest: "You are leaving here." I originally changed this job. I didn’t expect to send a letter so well now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill did not pay attention to this sentence, took the letter out and handed it to block The viscount of his way to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, let me see what this is, a letter from the elf? Wouldn’t it be for mercy?" Viscount tears open the envelope and sweeps After a few moments, I put the letter aside and said: "There is nothing new, it is this one. How are the elves so interested in what happened in my territory? But they really should not assign you this jazz to send letters. Everyone knows that you are a rigid, old and poor knight, and never good at talking. But I would like to know if the news is from the gentle mouth of the beautiful woman next to you, will it become beautiful? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave a point of mouth, the Viscount." Sir Bill pulled Leah's wrist and frowned and said: "Let's listen to the advice of friendly people." You are very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undead old ghosts, cursing them! I only love, but curse me, this is the face of a friendly person." The letter was thrown aside and said with annoyance: "The hub is here, I will not go to it. Place, they want to tempted, come on, I have nothing to hide. But dear jazz, you have to be careful, these elves are deep, they are always calculating!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. Bill saw that he could not convince the Viscount. After all, the grievances of the hub and the elves were too deep, not something that could be solved in a few words. In their history, there is a war of love, betrayal and revenge that lasts for three generations. If it was not after the Battle of the Great River, the royal family of the Star Kingdom requested that the Viscounts should not be in a good position with the Elf, and the Hubburg and Xinlin might still be in a state of war. Sir Bill saw nothing to say, so he could only retire and left Leah with the Chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cape Avenue traverses the entire outer city from both sides of the east and west, and the largest pubs, coaching stations and shops are on either side of the road. Unlike the bustling situation in the Ximu Town Market District, Hub Fort is not a big day for trading. It will only become crowded when the mines in the mountains are delivered weekly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not affect the good business of hotels and pubs for two reasons: Hubburg has planted a large number of apple trees, which produce good fruit wines; hubs Fort has an innkeeper guild, they will pay to listen to people to say long and short, collect all kinds of news, and explore various secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel looked at the jazz and the elf masters are not very good, so they serve them more well. Three people came to this main street and chose a hotel that looked the quietest, and took the horse and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Sunshine Inn of the Barrel Master." A seven-year-old boy with a fat boy welcomes everyone: "Do you have what you need?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two adjacent rooms, one of which has two beds." Sir Bill said: "Take care of our horses and put them in the forage." Beans and eggs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Package you are satisfied!” The little boy first put the horse on one side and helped Siegel move the luggage together and enter the hotel. A fat man who is obviously the boss is sleeping on the table, laughing and snoring, and is estimated to be dreaming. The little boy drilled down from under the table, took out the passenger register, collected the accommodation for three days, wrote a few pens on the book, and then drilled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are always ready to serve meals and drinks. If you have other needs, you can also find me. I am not welcoming at the door or the first one on the second floor. In the small room, the one that says 'the doorman'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Little guy, tell me that the 'big hammer' blacksmith shop is still open. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, there is still business." The doorman replied: "I remember that I almost closed the door a year ago, I don't know why it suddenly burst into flames. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Bill nodded and settled everyone in the team. He asked Siegel to practice the martial arts with the elves and then went to the big hammer blacksmith shop alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jazz came back in the evening, he had one more person behind him and two big cars. The man was in his thirties, very strong, and his arms were bulging in his clothes. He smiled and said with a big, thick hand: "It's nice to meet you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Jeff-Gold, the person who originally wanted to receive the goods." Sir Bill explained to everyone: "McKate is his partner, the trucks owned by the two are not expected to be Come back, so he is now bankrupt and decided to follow us as a blacksmith and a follower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome!" Siegel’s bones creaked. Struggling to get up from the ground, reaching out and clasping with the "gold coins." "You have to learn how to become a knight? Sir Bill is a very good lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I am not." The man said with a smile: " I just applied for bankruptcy protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? What does that mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a commercial term that means I’m going bankrupt and always looking for protection,” Jeff explained, and then he said, “I brought everything that wasn’t sold out in the shop. You see what you want, just use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, little nephew, he is right." Sir Bill nodded: "There is a pony outside, it's also yours. From now on you have to learn to ride a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel cheered and rushed out, Jeff After paying tribute to the Elves, I also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After both people left the room, Leah frowned and asked: "What happened, why bring this Jeff?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His goods were taken away by the partners, and the losses caused him to directly lose the shop and could not live here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not the reason to bring him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
