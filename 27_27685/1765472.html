			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the energy focusing lens will blow everything up and cover up all the traces of the spell. Siegel sneaked away while throwing out the soul crystal, so the last wave of shock did not hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moore was not far from him, turned over and stood up from the ground. He pulled a long bow and a floating shield flew beside him. The young attendant looked around with vigilance and suddenly realized that he was in the open space outside the city of Mire, and there was no danger around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel stood up and photographed the dirt on his body. The wand in his hand was slightly hot, causing some tingling in the fingers. This is the discomfort caused by the use of magic, and it does not matter. The concentration of elements in the Heim collar has been very stable and will soon complement the feeling of energy loss in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safe?" Moore asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the time being." Siegel said, "Let's go back to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The return of the lord made everyone relieved, but it seems that his mood is not high. In addition to showing a warm smile in front of Isaac, his face is always serious and terrible. Janet came to ask and didn't get an answer. The mages lord shut himself into the study, and no one was allowed to bother, claiming that he needed to clean up his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole day and night, the lights in the study have been lit. Siegel spread the map of the New World on the generous table and set the formation with pieces of various colors. This picture is not accurate, but it is enough to provide him with enough help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird news came one after another, some were expected by Siegel, and some came without warning. Among them, the disappearance of the ghost fog swamp was first transmitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense fog dissipated, the black water receded, and there were more than 600 years of ghost fog swamps on the New World, but they disappeared overnight. Large fertile land. The surrounding peasants are ecstatic, more land means more food and a better life, and they are quicker to enter the area than the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they met the elves, and the elves of the Tree Giants Corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a very small number of people have escaped, and all others have been killed or imprisoned, and all the crimes have "invaded" the border of the elves. "The area where the rune tree is located is the kingdom of the elves." The elves claim so. The tri-family agreement hundreds of years ago was based on the situation at the time. Rune trees can only grow near the forest of the Elven Holy Land, cannot survive elsewhere, and are not as far away as they are now. So the three tribes all agreed to use this way to determine the boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the elves would still be as immersed in their former glory as their compatriots in the old continent, remembering and commemorating the whole day, living a tragic and romantic life. But I did not expect them to find a way to improve rune trees for hundreds of years. Push the magic level of the Elf family to a new level. The mage, the druid, and the priests of the Moon Temple worked together to turn the Rune Tree into a tree giant. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest information, the elves manage these tree giants as war ancient trees to commemorate the combat weapons they used to fight the dragons in ancient times. The place where all the old trees exist is the land of the elves. Other races either surrender and leave immediately, or are ruthlessly eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden war has burned into every human territory, and the first line along the Cape Avenue is annexed. From Ximu Town to the west to the hub, it is now under the control of the elves. The ancient trees of war are at the rumbling pace, passing through the hills, fields, and rivers. All the villages were easily leveled by them. The peasants shunned the castle in horror, some lords opened the door to shelter the people, others closed the gate in fear, and shivered in the stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the elves have not started attacking the castle, but surrounded it with old trees. From the news from the occupied area, the elves thought that among the tri-family agreements, the human lords had at least the territory enclosed by the castle walls, because there were no war trees in them. But outside the city wall, since the trees are growing well. Then it should be taken over by the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the incident, Siegel immediately ordered that all the residents acted and began to build the wall. With the help of earth elements. A low wall that surrounds the original Heim collar was built. Although it was swaying and could not reach the standard of defensive siege weapons, it was finally seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves know that the strength of the human lord lies in the castle defense, so their tactics are very simple. Old war trees control the countryside, and only human cavalry can attack and pose a threat. But the old trees depend on each other, the loss of the cavalry will not be small, so in the end humans can only trap the castle, like an isolated island. There are no fields and villages, farmers who have not cultivated, what do people in the castle eat? Hunger will eventually help the elf to defeat all enemies, and humanity will eventually lose time, lose land and everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel thinks about it, in fact, human beings are really lost to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have a long life. They can develop a technology for one hundred, two hundred or even five hundred years, as long as they have identified the target. A hundred years of layout. When they come up with a thousand years of savings, what is there on the human side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, although human beings are more creative and progress faster, human life is shorter than elves, and "elimination" is faster. Continuous learning and re-accumulation have resulted in only a few people being able to be top-notch and not long. The number of mages, apprentices, and trainee mages is a thousand times that of the elves, and the formal mages have dozens of advantages, but at the level of the sorcerer, humans are far less than the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of the elf is completely out of the expectation of all "people", and it cannot be overemphasized by being caught off guard and defeated. A race that can compete with the dragon in the past has shown great strength and shocked the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans responded immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bones, human beings, like the orcs, have a factor of destruction. Since the elves attacked with trees, humans began to set fire. The burning fire is everywhere in the New World, and black smoke covers the sky. Sometimes the night sky is illuminated by a red flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move delays the progress of the Elf trees, but it does not stop. Elf Mage and Druid continue to cast spells and rain to fight the fire. The day when the fuel is always used up, the flame will always go out. The elves also became more careful in the battle. Under the cover of the trees, their archers will shoot as soon as they see the person trying to approach, and the chances of human beings setting fire are less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel also heard some news, such as benevolent elves will shoot instead of shooting. Especially for civilians who are not armed. Some people think that this is kindness, and some people think that this is just a trick to create wounded people and consume human supply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel heard these arguments and slammed the table hard to keep everyone quiet. He said with anger: "Be kind is not to shoot that arrow. The enemy's tricks are an excuse for their failure. All the elves close to Heim's outer wall, except for those who are armed with white flags, all give me a heavy shot. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about those old war trees? What do we resist?" Some people asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s eyes swept over all the knights present, and then asked: “What do you say about your surrounded knights and the weak in your vows? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights all stood up and screamed aloud: "Use my sword, honor and life!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel is so tough, rare and thundering, in fact, there is another reason: dwarf. The dwarf did nothing in this elf incident and let the incident happen. Their behavior of closing the country was very suspicious at this time. And then there is no explanation. The dwarf Elinette came to the city of Miele and did not disclose the reasons for their actions. This made Siegel very hurt. He also heard the news that there are many human refugees, including those who lived under the life of Mora, who climbed the wall under the threat of war. The mountains, in front of the door of Mora, hope that the dwarves will be able to open the gates and give them a place to take refuge. However, the closed door and the repeated repetition of the "national gate" of the curse completely wiped out the hopes of these people. There is no flame of hope. The coldness of the snow-capped mountains gradually eroded and claimed the fire of many people's lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard that there were many bodies that rolled down from the top of Mora and smashed on the ice and rocks. The blood of mankind has dyed the gods of the dwarfs, and even the ghosts of death on the road to the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves blocked the coast of the New World from east to west. The only one that can still connect with the old mainland is the only Deepwater City. So from the map, the city wall mountain has really become a prison, in which humans have nowhere to escape. Some lords bravely negotiated with the elves. It is said that under the premise of surrendering and laying down the weapons, the lord can take his own people to pass from the elf-occupied area and take the boat to the sea. Return to the old continent where the kingdom of powerful stars is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
