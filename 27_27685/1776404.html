			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Knight is a good opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he only has two hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel and Kerry were attacked before and after, facing the death knight, and soon forced it to a desperate situation, only with excellent armor and strong body support. How can it not understand why a mage and a barbarian can cooperate in such a tacit understanding in battle? The brutal attack of the barbaric does not go to defense at all, and the wizard can always block the flaws in the battle and let the mace hammer return without success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the defensive staff can not be hit by the hammerhead's heavy blow, and other weapons and equipment have no "immobility" characteristics. Therefore, the death knight turned to attack the mage, trying to solve him by collision, arc motion and high-frequency strike, so that he could resume the state of advance and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he knows how the ice gun can cause trouble to the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are constantly ice climbing up, condensing along the knees, thighs and shoulders, trying to get into the gaps of the armor. Every joint activity needs to crush the ice, which greatly destroys the coherence and smoothness of the movement, and the martial arts will not exert much threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two sounds, the ice gun hit the armor again, the death knight was awkward, but he quickly waved the mace and held the stabbed sword. This bleak sword is made of the star of the new star. The cutting edge is enough to penetrate the gold armor of the body, destroying the soul fire in his body is a huge threat. Every time you use a nail hammer to block, you will make your weapon a gap. No one knows how many times the above pattern will be destroyed, and there is no ability to sturdy and fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After knowing that it is impossible to win by virtue of martial arts alone, the death knight will examine himself, and there are still many powers of the soul soul crystal, which is enough to release several spells. He just saw how the Master resisted the Dragon spell, causing the Black Dragon to play a magical state. He would not repeat the same mistakes. He must use spells that would not be seen in the spellcasting or the language of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its eyes flash a red glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All warriors, leave here immediately, don't watch the game!" Siegel shouted: "It tries to control the hearts of the people!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry roared. Muscles swell, body growth, and the blood of the ice giants broke out. He is controlled by the battle instinct and will not be affected by other thought control effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knight was shocked, but he did not expect that this Master would have mastered the abilities of General Nikes. Moreover, the soldiers in this castle are highly obedient, only for a very short period of time, and only two opponents in front of them are left in the range of its casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maddening big man is hard to control, and there is only the mage in front of him. But when it uses the power of the mind, it finds that a gimmick is watching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same green plasma pattern spreads on the cockroach. A pure tolerance system. It quickly swept over the eyes and found that the sorcerer became a general, higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the body is more solid and sturdy, apparently immersed in negative energy for a long time, I am afraid that I have experienced many processes of world destruction, absolutely a void fighter The strongest one. In addition, he can still use spells, and he can restrain his own spell ability. This battle has no chance of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the death knight will not be depressed because of failure. Destruction is nothing but a return to nothingness. It is the result of everything that must be faced. It has no other ideas. Only the two people in front of him are left together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflamed soul crystal under the armor began to heat up, and the energy contained in it was forcibly extracted and gathered on the gold armor. The armor's ability to withstand is limited, and it will explode after it exceeds it. Coupled with the homeopathic destruction of the power of the mace and the body of the plasma, its power is no less than a meteorite drop. At that time, the storm formed by lightning would cover the entire castle and ruin everything and tear it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, it launched a crazy attack, especially entangled in the Master. This person is too dangerous and has a good understanding of the situation of Nexus. And have the ability to make targeted arrangements. Today's trapping of the Black Dragon, specially designed weapons and all tactics must have been conceived by him. So he must die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel left the right and blocked the direction of the death knight. Let Kerry always be on the back of the death knight, so as to launch a faster, more accurate and effective blow. Through the plasma lines on his body, he also felt the change of energy around him, knowing that a smoldering crystal is burning at no cost. He instantly understood the enemy's plan, but did not immediately make a counter-attack, but continued to guide and lure. Planning in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""", your little movements are in my expectation." Siegel hides behind the defensive staff and blocks a heavy blow. . The energy contained in the staff is getting lower and lower, and now every time you meet with the mace, you need to use the power of your arm to help. However, the death knight does not seem to find this, or it does not care after deciding to blew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." The death knight slammed one step and blocked the stardust sword. "Which do you dominate?" Its shoulders were iced The pistol pierced, bringing a large piece of armor and bone fragments, "actually trying to stop the destruction and demise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't want to stop the destruction and demise, Only the goal is you." Siegel swears the spell, loosens the defensive staff, and suddenly withdraws. The staff received instructions and was suspended in the air, but it was still not a mace that could be knocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the death knight felt the loosening of the defensive staff and knew that it had reached its limit. No wonder the wizard wants to leave the battle, it seems that he does not want to destroy with this castle. The Death Knight is determined to leave this Master anyway, and he must not let him leave with information on how to deal with Nexus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold armor shines again, and the death knight accelerates in an instant. It pulled its body out of the ice gun and circumvented the defensive staff in front of it, and came to Siegel in an instant. It clearly sees that the opponent is picking up something in his arms, maybe a scroll, maybe a spell wand, but it doesn't matter, even the skull of the death knight can't stand the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the approaching ice guns - it doesn't matter, it is thought - even if you hit the soul fire, the shackles of Nissan will not die immediately. . It can last longer before the arrival of nothingness, enough to detonate the power of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black mace with the power of death, like a mountain falling from the sky. In the middle of the journey, the impact has already blown away the wreckage around, and the gravel flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, it was empty and only hit a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel’s shifting cloak was launched at the same time as he retreated, deceiving the death knight. Using this momentary space, Siegel took out a scepter made of platinum, sapphire and dragon steel with an opal on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter is covered with plasma lines and magic runes, and is violently shaking under the influence of the Siegel spell. This is an energy-focusing lens scepter that has a very versatile use and can only absorb the energy emitted by the surrounding souls or grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opal shines brightly and turns red quickly. At the same time, the plasma lines on Siegel and the death knight all faded, and their movements became sluggish. But the most important point is that the power of the Death Knight's armor, the Inflammatory Soul Crystal, has been exhausted, and there is no possibility of an explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The death knight screamed and the anger of the undead broke out in an instant. He broke the illusion caused by the shift and rushed in the direction of Siegel's true body. This time I used my teeth and I also shattered the head of the wicked mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice gun is faster than it, piercing from the back of the helmet and coming out of the teeth of the death knight. The power of the ice broke out from the inside out, and numerous pieces of ice crystals filled the empty space in the skull. The soul fire was hit hard and began to annihilate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mace hammer is as heavy as a kilogram, and can no longer be controlled. It can only slip from the death knight. At the end of the warrior's warrior, they stretched their arms forward and tried to grab Siegel's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust pierced the armor of the Death Knight and cut off the spine. The ice-cold guns were pulled out and stabbed, breaking the part of the death knight's shoulder. The evil spirits and negative energy breaths all disappeared, indicating that the death knight has completely finished, and will never pose a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy-focusing scepter squeaks and sways more and more. Sapphire carries too much energy and has begun to emit black smoke. Siegel rushed to pull it up and a flash came over the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
