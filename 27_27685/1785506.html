			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a rare opportunity to avoid the new federation from the control of the Masters Association. WwW.XsHuotXT.com" Idis looks at the crystal ball in front of him Listen carefully to the sound inside. "Try to eliminate the misunderstanding caused by the Elven War and focus on cultivating the next generation of Masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis nodded and said to the figure in the crystal ball: "West This thing, called the Mire Nuclear, made by Geer Master is very powerful, and it can almost let a mage cast spells without stopping. Whether it is the original mana pool of the Confederation or the rune tree of the elves, there is no such ability. I doubt the lion. Wang Alexander was still alive and had contact with Siegel. Only he knew the entire structure of the mana pool. And I calculated that this ritual could not be completed without the help of the caster of the * division level."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alexander is dead, this is very conclusive in the prophecy, but your doubts are very reasonable, maybe they met before the deep water city broke." Crystal The figure in the ball said: "Since there is a better choice than the mana pool, then the secret energy core is the most important goal of the association. You are in the city of Mier, is it possible to break this nuclear structure?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis shook his head, and he has not forgotten the loneliness that the elements around him no longer obey orders. "The nuclear itself has strong elemental control and magical resistance. I think that any behavior that casts spells on it is a dead end. Even a magical figure with complete magical resistance can't bear the attack of elemental torrents. It has been verified in the elemental surge of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the only breakthrough is Siegel himself?" After a while, he said: "This person is very strange. Since the end of the orc war, the prophecy can't capture his fate. Is the result of Faranis doing his best to cast a spell? Is it dead? You said, is he likely to have already Becoming a *teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty-two-year-old *? It's hard to imagine." Edith shook his head. "I prefer that he has stood on the threshold of becoming a * division. Not the power of a * division. But I have to admit that this speed is already shocking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Another lower voice came from the crystal ball, and Idis was surprised that the opposite was not just a person. The low voice said: "I want to predict a person's future. I need to start from his past. Edith, you are closest to him. Your task is to constantly release goodwill. Compared to the secret nuclear, the federation does not Important, their freedom of fantasy and independence are not important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idis does not know who the owner of this voice is, so he did not respond immediately. After waiting for a while, the sound he was familiar with was passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be one thing at a time to focus, so your task is to stay with Siegel and help him constantly. Young people will always be proud, let When he had a need for the Masters Association, everything was natural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiss thought, if Siegel developed with his own strength, Will the idea of ​​the Masters Association be too wishful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idis, his eyes are long-term, and Siegel’s youth is self-sufficient. There is no need to care too much about the gains and losses of a few years. How many years? We have patience to deal with him. Now, you are going to prepare for their meeting. Since Siegel knows that you are a member of the association, you have to take measures to deal with it. I thought I could take the opportunity to take him. Fighting over, I didn’t expect Siegel’s wariness to be so heavy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The people who are serious about it naturally have a corresponding approach.” Idis said: “I will Act in accordance with your instructions, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the crystal ball nodded. Then it disappeared. Idis put the ball in the space bag and closed it with the "secret space" spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sorts out the mage robes on his body and smoothes the folds. The familiar feeling on the palm made him feel good, unlike the rainbow ball that can be seen from the window. For the first time he was unable to do anything about the task assigned to him by the Masters Association. If you can have a more energetic young person to perform, maybe it is much better than your own old guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Hold on for a while. He pulled out the key with his neck, opened the dark space under the table, and found a bottle of green medicine. Even through the bottle filled with the magic array, Idis can still sense the powerful vitality contained in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, he may not see the day when Siegel worked for the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the slanting hall of the city of Syracuse, Siegel is holding Isaac and his knights to dine together. After Wendy reminded him, he felt that he was not only too few in the federation, but also lacked familiarity in front of his knight. So he changed his habit of dining in his own study, as long as he was not in a magic experiment that could not be interrupted, he would appear here every morning and noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac hates porridge, but after Janet is out, he must start adapting to the food in advance. Despite finding a few nurses, the black-haired guys are not interested in them all, and they only reluctantly take two when they are very hungry. Usually he lives on a warm goat's milk, or eats some soft porridge with honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the scented porridge with magic adds to Isaac’s interest, he is very interested in the turnip stew on the table. Siegel didn't know if such a big child could eat this kind of food, so he only fed him some soup. Isaac was very dissatisfied and spit a bit on Dad’s robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to eat fish, you can pick him up after picking the thorn." Mana put down the knife and fork and reached out to Siegel: "Yes Don't let me hold for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I can fix him." Siegel's fingers are on the clothes, all the smudges are immediately disappear. Isaac's mouth was stuffed with fish, then he waved his spoon like a victorious knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if this little guy will become a knight or a magician when he grows up." Mana asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look where he has the talent to say it. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, everyone can't make up their minds now." Mana said: "There are rumors that you want to incorporate the wizard's mages into Heim's decision-making system, just like the Star Kingdom and the City. The relationship is the same. The knights are worried. After all, the power of the wizard is mysterious and powerful, not all wizards are like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said about me It’s true that I’ve thought about it, but it’s one of my thousands of thoughts. It’s hard to say that it’s hard to say. The Cavaliers have guesses that worrying is also a good thing, and they can add some pressure. The knights fear the Master’s Wand. Believe me, the wizards are also afraid of the sword, this is no different.” Siegel looked at Mana, showing a confident smile: “I can change this situation, do you believe me?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly believe it!" Mana immediately said: "You can even catch the sun. On the face, what else can't you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun? Do you mean the secret nuclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, what else? It is now the most popular attraction in the city of Mith, no local residents have not seen it. The merchants who come and go will not miss it. If there is no warning sign and fence It is estimated that there will be many people who want to touch the feeling of the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They slowly understand the real role of the secret nuclear." Siegel said: "I hope that the meeting of the Federation can achieve the goal I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord, will they be loyal to you?" Na said: "If they can't do it, will it be dangerous to stay in the territory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Danger and opportunity are coexisting, but I I don’t think that would happen.” Siegel said: “Many of them still tend to stay in Heim’s collar and build it into a new wizarding federation. My The task is to convince them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That Isaac must become a magician." Mana said: "Only the Master commanded the Cavaliers, never against When you come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things will always change. Siegel looked at the knight sitting around and changed the subject: "Mana, tell me something outside the territory. Are the lords of the South settled down?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At the moment it is basically peaceful. "Mana said: "But there are a few rumors that are disturbing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About us? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
