			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the lab is a deep passage, with footsteps running from both sides. The explosion of WwW.XsHuoTXt.com weakened the structure here, and dust continued to fall from the ceiling above the head. The cracks on the walls are still slowly expanding, and it is believed that large areas will collapse soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel used the four-pulse arrow in the gap of the wall, then grabbed a stone on the ground and stuffed it into the wall to cover it. He then used the leveling technique to find the location of the equipment he had taken away. He had cast an invisible spell and disappeared from the scene before the arrival of the murderous believer who came to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people ran to the direction of the lab, and they were unaware of the Siegel passing by. The mage's lightly avoiding the swaying arm and anxious mood is like a humble wind. Then, another explosion came from the laboratory. The power was not very big, but the subsequent landslide was the real killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the guidelines of positioning, Siegel found the warehouse with the shortest route. My own things have not yet entered the warehouse, just piled up in the next room, waiting for the identification of the craftsman. Although the most valuable things, such as the defensive staff, the dust of the stars, etc., were not found in the key space, they are now in good hands. But the rest of those things do not need to be the murder of the god of murder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Siegel did not think about using his own vines to find Treasure between the Temple of the God of Murder. If you want to take it first, it is the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse has a strong defense and warning array, but the identification room next door does not. A colloidal warrior stayed at the door, and the translucent eyes underneath the body were staring at the empty passage. Suddenly a dagger appeared out of thin air and stabbed in between the eyes. The colloidal warrior only saw that it was a black dagger, and then there was no more consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel showed his body from the invisibility and looked around. It is very likely that someone will pass by here, and it is not good if there is no guard. So he applied a spider web and carefully controlled the range to glue the gum warrior to the wall behind him. Siegel adjusted his posture and used magic tricks to change the smell around him. Cover up the stench that may be emitted. It only takes ten minutes, and the gelatinous monster will become a stone, firmly supporting the outer body of the iron body, and no one can see the clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel pushes the door with a defensive stick. With the help of the spell, the door lock automatically opened and he slipped into the appraisal room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First put all of your things back, after all, it’s too wild to cover your body with illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic enchantment in the appraisal room, I don’t know what it is for. If it is Siegel. This must be the strongest defense, because no one knows what kind of risk the unknown will bring. Simply look at the detection magic, there is no strong magic fluctuations here, so the value of dozens of things on the shelf is not high. Instead of taking care of them, Siegel used the power of the Elven Saint to transmit his illusion to Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler Alfred is dozing off in the general management room, and the soft snoring is clearly transmitted through the communication spells. It was rare to see him wearing pleated clothes with a messy moustache on his face. It is estimated that he has not left the room from the moment he received the message of the start of the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aide, wake up. You have to tell me what is going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general manager seemed to be standing up from the chair as if he had clicked. After seeing Siegel, it was difficult to hide his excitement. "Lord Lord, you are fine. All your instructions are in accordance with the prior plan. The Heim Collar and the Elven Forest are all in action. But the Master of the Federation, as you might expect, is unwilling to act with the elves." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, the elves are the initiators of this mission, let them charge forward. As long as the federation does not conflict with the elves." Siegel is worried that if the federation develops, it will be difficult to prevent the elves from revenge, which will give Heim a big trouble. So using the opportunity he can now control the situation, let the two meet and ease the mood. At least create a model that can communicate. The conflict is not terrible, but the conflict without a negotiation channel will only continue to expand, which is not good for his territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana and Zucker led the garrison of the territory, all equipped with the latest plasma 。矢. Several wizards of the federation are willing to provide us with Spell help. By the way, check out the newly made spell weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wywood uses the Mire Nuclear to create a long-lasting portal that can remain open for the first time. It can be maintained for fifteen minutes at a time, and then burns down what device - I can't remember the strange name. He It is safer to say that this method is more safe to use for joint transmission than the method of joint casting. Therefore, the lord, this time there will be a thousand Heim-collected soldiers and one thousand five hundred elf warriors. Going forward to support you, not the elite troops that were originally planned for dozens of people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel violently coughed up and was obviously stunned by this news. The ability to stabilize the portal spells can only be controlled by the division, and the places where the transmission can reach can communicate with each other. It is amazing. For example, a level mage like Rees can only open a narrow space crack, which makes the summoning thing very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled that long-acting portals should not be able to communicate with each other, and can only be used in the main material plane, with limited functionality. But in any case, this is a huge improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the army going?" Siegel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the elf's troops are in front, and we have passed the transmission line after the Helm-led troops." Alfred replied: "But there is a situation where they send back information and say that there is no one in the target location, and they don't see the swordsmanship of our secret city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er frowned. He sent a message to Evan, letting him open the beacon so that the wizard's mage could transfer the position. It is important to look for Janet, but in essence this task is to work with the elves to investigate the stronghold of the murder god. As for the location of the stronghold, it is necessary to look at the elf to attack. The army led by Heim will only do some auxiliary work, and certainly will not be the main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these five people ready to sneak into this stronghold to save me? Once Siegel had this idea, he began to worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are other things that I need to know, Ed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wizard is set to Distribute the attack at dawn, now..." He turned his head and looked at the sky, then said: "It should start attacking now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I know "Siegel saw no other things and ended the call." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show is in full swing. Siegel summoned the invisible servant and handed the space bag to it, letting it search for magic in this room to the warehouse next door, believing that a large earth element rune guard could penetrate the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder god does not have many powerful subordinates of the caster, so there are many loopholes in the defensive array applied to the warehouse. There is nothing wrong with guarding the little thief, but it doesn't make any sense to Sergeur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Yao En and others may have sneaked into this stronghold, finding them is currently the first. Another important thing is to find the transmission matrix of this stronghold and keep it intact so that it can find out where it is going. This must be done before the Holy One of the murderer believes that the stronghold cannot be kept, otherwise he and he may be able to destroy the transmission array when he leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a noisy footstep in the hallway outside, and the servants of the murder god ran to tell: "Open the warehouse, take the weapons, the elves are killed." Go to support the pastors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is thinking about opening the secret of the warehouse, Siegel can feel the magical fluctuations around, like a breeze across the lake, Shallow ripples. He smiled softly, so that these people can see what it feels like to know the tsunami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the defensive staff float and follow, so that you can free your hands. He closed his eyes, looked up, and raised his hands high. At the bottom of the earth, surrounded by the power of earth elements, and not far from the top of the head, there are surging sea water, which is an endless treasure of water elements. In this environment, the power of using these two elements is most convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who had a murderer thought of the identification room next to the warehouse, and thought that there were a lot of magical equipment on the shelf, so he pushed the door in and out. He saw the empty shelves, a large earth element that was opening a hole in the side wall, and a black-eyed human mage standing in the middle of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you!" The priest only said three words, and then he noticed that something was wrong. The surrounding air is filled with the strength of viscous elements, and there is a mixture of earth and water, like a swamp, like a quicksand. His voice became turbid, and it was too ambiguous to spread far. Only the voice of the opposite young mage can be passed clearly and brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
