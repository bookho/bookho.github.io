			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [], to provide you with wonderful novel reading. Casper was standing in the study room, and the surrounding windows were all covered with thick curtains. There was no illumination in the room, and the thick darkness surrounded him, which made him feel comfortable and rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like his feelings when facing the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knox Commonwealth has been on the right track, and after merging into the Mage Federation, you can use the New World’s mage organization to quickly expand its influence. They built magic towers in Macabu, Ximu Town and Hubburg, and the shadows of the North began to leave the original nest under the attraction of the magic array. I believe that soon there will be a large number of inflammatory soul crystals, which can be used as a material for the magic array, or sacrificed to the god of red to get more magical help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is not without setbacks. What happened recently in the South made him somewhat unclear. The failure of the Southern Alliance Army was not beyond his expectations. There were two concepts in the army of the caster and the uncaster, and the city of Mith was not a good bone. He used prophetic spells to predict the outcome of the battle and found that attacking the city of Myers represents an unquestionable "ghost." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still issued the command of the offense, because he needed the chaos of the South and found the forces that could be supported and controlled from the chaos. The result was unexpected. The wizard named Siegel quickly solved the chaos in the south. The newly emerged four aristocratic forces ended their mutual hostility. Everyone carefully watched other people and formed temporary checks and balances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only one way to cause chaos. As long as the Red Magic Tower can be established and the emotions between the territories are provoked, it is easy to rekindle the war. But recently, the common meeting found that all the casting activities in the South, especially the establishment of magic towers and magic laboratories, were all restricted, and the root of all this is Siegel. The lords of the South refused Knox's construction work without the authorization of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not come to me for your Master's business." The lords shirked: "I don't want to cause any trouble."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all afraid of offending the Master Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that made Caspar puzzling is the disappearance of his big apprentice. The contact that was originally made every month has not been heard for four months. Casper did not understand what caused the loss. The child would never dare to do this, and there must be something very serious happening. There is some hunch in his heart. Still reluctant to admit the possibility of his apprentice's death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a smart child, and ambitious, but more importantly, it’s a gift, it’s a make-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you can't do the job. What do you want him to use? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinlong and Heifeng still have no news, the people who are looking for work are now missing, and Casper has lost patience. And the plan of the Knox Association was at a critical time, as the arrow had to be sent on the strings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock on the door outside, and it was very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar’s teacher waved gently. Light up the lights in the room. The light dispels the darkness, the fireplace burns, and the whole room looks like a living, it looks warm and comfortable. This time Casper let the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King Alexander stood at the door with a serious expression. His magic pet cat slouched on his shoulders, but squinted at everything around him, always alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caspar Master, there is information from the school, and important things happen, and a three-tower meeting is needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be Lord Alexander. This kind of thing makes it easy for apprentices to inform, why do you have to run it yourself?" Casper’s teacher waved, a long The metal staff flew into his hand. The "Lion King" eyes stunned and recognized that it was a powerful staff and a powerful magic item. In addition to being able to cast spells including missiles, fireballs, force fields, spells and enchantments, he can also be deliberately destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more energy remaining in the staff, the greater the power of destruction. And the action of destruction happens in an instant, pure magic energy will form a similar element surge in a small range, especially to the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, pre-ambush triggering spells on the body, as long as the action of deliberately destroying the power wand. It will trigger immediately and transfer the body away - for safety reasons, you can't set the transfer of the belongings, otherwise the staff will be taken away. Therefore, the power of the Staff has always been regarded as a symbol of threat by the Master, especially when conducting a rally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar Master does not seem to have this awareness, holding a power staff in his hand. Like an ordinary walking stick used by an old man. They came to the conference room together, and "traveler" William has been waiting here for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His talent is much better than William, but he can't find it. When entering the room, Casper finally thought about his apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William’s gaze swept over the scepter in Caspar’s hand, but it was silent and his expression was exactly the same as before. There are only three people in the room, and the Masters Union has the highest status and the strongest three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I received reliable information, the Star Kingdom was caught in a civil war." Alexander's tone was serious and calm, just like his usual expression. "When the king was hunting, he fell into a horse. He just broke a few bones. It was not serious. But when the priest of the Star Temple was treated, he suddenly became violent and left a pile of conjectures about conspiracy. Prince Aaron immediately succeeded to the throne. Announced that the two dukes of Cado and Sylt were the conspirators who killed the king, and the accomplices, their illegitimate children, Evan Kim. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;卡Spa has his own source of intelligence, and such a thing happened in the starry kingdom. He secretly observed William's expression, guessing how much he knew, and what attitude he took in this incident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William took a sickle and boring his nails. Every time he feels that his style is not good, he will grow a little more and then start over. He obviously does not care about the things of the starry kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avon. Kim Kwai came to the school with a stack of books and asked the sergeant there to do the appraisal. The book was written by the former king. Give Avon the surname of the stars and remove the title of his illegitimate child. Since the actual age of Evan is bigger, he becomes the heir to the first order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp William raised his head at this time and asked with great interest: "Oh, is Aaron not always a Crown Prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King shook Shaking his head: "There has never been a formal script to confirm this, but it is forgotten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar's mouth gently provokes, maybe not forgot, He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, the kingdom of stars is on the verge of division and civil war. Supporting the lords of both sides is constantly rubbing, but because no one is sure that neighbors are enemies and friends, plus The territorial dogs are staggered, so there has not been a full-scale war. Aaron has been a prince for so many years. He has gathered many aristocratic forces, but his body is too bad and has no children. Avon is the oldest, but in addition to being an excellent There are no other strengths besides the swordsman. As for the younger son of the king, Mark Bo, who is only 4 years old. Whoever is holding him, who is the greatest ambitious, is safe now. The original star temple is the support of the royal family. There is a good voice, and the king’s death is unclear and he has lost his persuasive power. Aaron and Evan are not willing to fully believe in the temple, and the temple does not dare to speak easily.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Live it! These guys who are gods and gods look like flowers, but in fact they are not as good as before. This incident is another big lesson. It is estimated that they can no longer turn over in the heart of the royal family. "Williams gloated, put down the sickle." I finally started to have an interest in the meeting. “How to say in the city, this is a good opportunity to re-enter the political core!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar’s teacher shook his head and he understood the human heart. Far higher than the two in front of me: "According to my estimation, the school city will now be wavering. The situation is too complicated, and the side is not safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Nodded, "The ** division said that it is correct. At present, the school is divided into three factions: Evan, Aaron, and Jing Guan. They have been arguing all day long, no one can convince others, and they are temporarily unable to act." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! No profit from the adventure? It’s time to test your guts!" William is the most incomprehensible way for the old man to drag and drop. Waving to express his dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also know that they are lacking in guts. Otherwise, where is the federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not adventurous, like to travel? With such obvious preferences, it is natural to make good use of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Alexander said his concerns. The school came to the message, to recruit him to discuss the next thing. Since Aaron and Evan have all helped in the New World. The Mage Federation unexpectedly became a middleman that both forces can recognize. The school recommended it, and the Masters Association also passed the proposal, inviting Alexander to leave as soon as possible to go to the civil war to mediate the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I left, Lord Casper was responsible for the day-to-day affairs, and William, you ran more to understand what the dwarf was doing recently." Alexander The news made Caspar ecstatic, and it seems that the days of mastering the Three Peaks Tower are close at hand. The Lion King went on to say: "Mora's Donkey has closed the country for several months. There is no news in and out. I always have an unpredictable hunch. Such a day is really disturbing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, let me give this matter." William's hand, a look of excitement. "I have long wanted to try out if the dwarf's rune defense system is really flawless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not cause unnecessary disputes, just let you Going to reconnaissance is not a war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caspar is a polite one, and he is humble and cautiously optimistic about his ability to manage the Mage Federation. The Lion King seems to trust him very much, but his real thoughts are deeply hidden, and he can't see it from his serious face. William is still a gameman, but if he has no sense of responsibility, how can he be selected as one of the Big Three? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guys are not good at dealing with them. Their cards are very deep, but who doesn’t have a few cards? Caspar is full of confidence and his layout is being implemented step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the conference room was pushed open and a mage appeared at the door. Such a reckless move triggered an attack on the enclosing enchantment. At one time, the elemental energy was like a squally shower, and the heroes who took the shot to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard waves his wand and instantly projects himself into the shadow plane, trying to avoid these attacks. At the same time, the protective spells on his body also light up in turn, forming a layer of protection. But it didn't make much sense. The spell still blew him out of the shadows, and he continued to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander frowned, and then raised his hand, all the elemental fluctuations instantly calmed down, the spells left a gorgeous appearance, but lost the lethality. This move was beyond everyone's expectations, and even the other two divisions did not understand how it was done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scola, why is it still so reckless, don't know if we are in a meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turned out that this person is an apprentice of the Lion King. The spell talent is very good, but his temper is urgent and straight, and he is like a girl. If it is normal, he must have a hippie smile and say "I know the teacher will save me" to perfuse the past. But this time he was sweating and it looked very flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves," his tone trembled: "The elf raided the hub, where the Master Tower was under attack. The town of Ximu also heard the news, the elf cavalry The port has been controlled for transportation, except for the Master Tower. All of them have changed their owners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are they crazy?!" The three sergeants stood up at the same time. Alexander is slamming the table. "The New World is not a place where his elves can scatter. In the agreement between humans, dwarves, and elves, they can only operate within the scope of the Elf Rune Tree. Attacking other areas is aggression. What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the Elf Forest stood up and ran around with his legs. So the border of the Elf was expanding and it occupied the hinterland of the New World." Scola trembled. Intermittently, I finally understood the words: "They made a strong army, the army of trees. Rune Forest came alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alarm tells the Sham Shui Po lord to prepare for the war." Then he said to William: "It seems that I can't go to school, I don't worry about the New World. You go to the dwarf as quickly as possible and ask them. If you don't pay attention to you, remove their gold gates and ask if the tri-family agreement is meaningless to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William nodded and smashed He replied: "Do not worry, I'm the fastest to complete this thing." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
